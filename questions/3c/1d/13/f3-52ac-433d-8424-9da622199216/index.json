  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe SEBI had introduced a regulation that the chairman of the company must not be related to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or the Managing Director (MD). He or she must be a non- executive director. This is to be applicable to the top 500 listed companies.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nAccording to the SEBI regulations, the post of MD and that of CEO must be split. This was introduced by amending the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations. The deadline was recently postponed from April of 2020 to April of 2022."
