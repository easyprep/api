The World Economic Forum's inaugural report of 2020 Global Social Mobility Index report measures the social mobility of 82 countries based on five key metrics such as health care, education, technological access, work opportunities and social protection. Social mobility dictates whether children are on the path to having a better life than their parents, or if they will remain tethered to their social-economic status. India ranked 76 and Cote d'Ivoire ranked 82, the least socially mobile country in the world."
