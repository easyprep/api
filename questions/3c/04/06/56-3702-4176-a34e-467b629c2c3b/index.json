  "explanation": "Professional social network site LinkedIn on Wednesday launched a new tool called 'Scheduler' that will help ease the hiring process both for recruiters and candidates as well as avoid fallouts. 'LinkedIn Scheduler' automates initial interview scheduling for recruiters and candidates, directly via InMail. The new tool would help candidates and recruiters save time spent on scheduling a meeting and help recruiters focus their energies on hiring strategically and onboarding the best candidate, the Microsoft-owned company. LinkedIn 'Scheduler' is just the latest way that we're working to make recruiters more productive, powerful, and personal, Rigano added. To use the feature, recruiters first need to automatically provide availability via InMail by syncing 'Scheduler' to Office 365 or Google calendar.",
