  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "These are temperate winds which originate in West Asia, the Mediterranean sea and at times even as far as Atlantic Ocean and happen to reach Afghanistan, Pakistan and North-West India. These happen to reach our part of the world more in winter because of the southward shift of the polar front in winter. Since, the temperate cyclones reach India in winter from the west , they are called ‘Western Disturbances’. So, during winter, Western Disturbances cause rainfall in Northern and North West India. The Western Disturbances lead to winter rainfall , which is beneficial for Rabi crop (wheat). In this question, Cotton and Groundnut both are Kharif crops."
