  "explanation": "William Jones was not the earliest among the orientalists of the east India company to arrive in India. About a decade earlier came Charles Wilkins (1770), Nathaniel Brassy Halhed (1722) and Jonathan Duncan (1722); Warren Hastings’s bright young situations- the Asiatic society and the college at Fort William. All the orientalists who became famous in history clustered around either the society or the college or both. The society, of course, was the pioneer and first in the field. While others were thinking in terms of individual study and research, sir William Jones was the first man to think in terms of a permanent organization for oriental studies and researches on a grand scale in this country. He took the initiative and in January 1784 sent out a circular letter to selected persons of the elite with a view to establishing a society for this purpose. In response to his letter, thirty European gentlemen of Calcutta including Mr. justice Hyde, john Carnac, Henry Vansittart, john shore, Charles Wilkins, Francis Gladwin, Jonathan Duncan and others gathered on 15 January 1784 in the grand jury room of the old supreme court of Calcutta. The chief justice sir Robert chambers presided at the first meeting and Jones delivered his first discourse in which he put forward his plans for the society. Asia, he said, was the nurse of sciences and the inventers’ of delightful and useful arts. He proposed to found a society under the name of the Asiatic society. The name went through a number of Asiatic society (1784-1825), the Asiatic society (1825-1832), the Asiatic society of Bengal (1832-1935), the royal Asiatic society of Bengal (1936-1951) and the Asiatic society again since July 1951."
