  "answer": "Haiti",
  "explanation": "Haiti is the country of origin of the religion \"Vodou\". Haitian Vodou is an African diasporic religion that developed in Haiti between the 16th and 19th centuries. It arose through a process of syncretism between the traditional religions of West Africa and the Roman Catholic form of Christianity. Adherents are known as Vodouists or \"servants of the spirits\". There is no central authority in control of Vodou, which is organised through autonomous groups.",
