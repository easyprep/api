  "answer": "Google",
  "explanation": "Prasar Bharati has tied up with Google and its video sharing platform YouTube to telecast the 72nd Independence Day programme live online on 15th August 2018 to increase digital presence. Prasar Bharati CEO Shashi Shekhar Vempati has stated that the live stream window will be seen on the homepage of Google itself so that people do not have to look for a separate link to go to the Youtube channel. In a first-of-its-kind digital drive, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s speech from Red Fort will be live streamed on both Google and YouTube. This year, Doordarshan anchors will introduce the programme from Red Fort instead of the studios. Doordarshan will also translate the PMâ€™s speech in over 20   regional languages. The Independence Day coverage will open with a song composed by Shankar Mahadevan. This service was first used by Google to telecast the inauguration ceremony of US President Donald Trump in January 2017."
