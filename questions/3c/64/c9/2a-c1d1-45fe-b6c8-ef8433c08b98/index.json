  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "The Central Government had created a dedicated fund, called Central Road Fund (CRF) for <u>collection of cess from petrol and diesel under the </u>Central Road Fund Act, 2000. Its name was amended in Budget 2018 and is now known as Central Road and Infrastructure Fund (CRIF). The fund was also taken out from Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and shifted to Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance. The objective of the amendment was to use proceeds of the road cess under CRIF to finance other infrastructure projects such as waterways, some portion of the railway infrastructure and even social infrastructure, including education institutions and medical colleges."
