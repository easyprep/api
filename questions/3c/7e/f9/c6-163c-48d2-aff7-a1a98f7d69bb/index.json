  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nA caretaker government is an ad hoc government. It holds limited powers, especially when it comes to law-making. Belgium’s Sophie Wilmes took over as the caretaker PM in October after the previous PM Charles Michel resigned to take up the post of European Council president.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:        </strong>\nBelgium went 541 days without a government in 2010-11. This is a world record for a country in peacetime. Northern Ireland’s Stormont assembly overtook Belgium by the number of days. However, it doesn’t qualify as laws could be passed by the Westminster."
