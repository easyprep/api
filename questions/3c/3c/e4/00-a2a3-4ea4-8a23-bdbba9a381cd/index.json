  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "All are incorrect",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nSilicosis is an occupational disease that affects the pulmonary system. It is caused by prolonged exposure to silica in crystalline form. The inhaled particles cause scarring and inflammation of lung tissue. It is often misdiagnosed as tuberculosis. Hence the miners are calling for proper diagnosis and treatment.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nCyanosis or discoloration of the skin is one of the symptoms of silicosis. The symptoms do not appear immediately and may take years to develop. Other symptoms include weight loss, fatigue, chest pain, respiratory problems like shortness of breath, cough, etc.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nSilicosis has no specific treatment at present. It is a permanent disease and it is hard to reverse the damage. It has potential to cause permanent physical disability. Preventing exposure is the most effective solution. Protection of the workers is mandated in the Factory Act.\n&nbsp;"
