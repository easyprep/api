  "question": "800 Rs. at 5% per annum compounded annually will amount to 882 Rs. in :",
  "option1": "1 year",
  "option2": "2 years",
  "option3": "3 years",
  "option4": "4 years",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 years",
  "explanation": "$latex A = P\\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{R}{100} \\\\right )^{T}&s=1$\r\n$latex => 882 = 800\\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{5}{100} \\\\right )^{T}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{882}{800} = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{21}{20} \\\\right )^{T}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{441}{400} = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{21}{20} \\\\right )^{2}= \\\\left ( \\\\frac{21}{20} \\\\right )^{T}&s=1$\r\nâˆ´ T = 2 years\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer."
