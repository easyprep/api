  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nMost of the meteor showers are sourced from comets. However, the Quadrantids meteor shower is sourced from an asteroid. The asteroid 2003 EH1, pieces of which manifest as the meteor shower, is considered as a ‘rock comet’ or a ‘dead comet’ by astronomers.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe Quadrantids meteor shower usually occurs between December and January. It is mostly visible from the Northern Hemisphere. Their ‘radiant point’ or the apparent point of origin in the sky is the Bootes constellation, also known as the ‘Herdsman’ constellation."
