Though Rhesus Macaque monkeys are protected species under Schedule II of the  Wildilfe Protection Act of 1972, the law allows for it to be hunted by declaring it ‘vermin’ for a specific period if it poses a danger to human life or property. The section 62 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act of 1972 empowers the states to send a list of wild animals to the Centre requesting it to declare them vermin for selective slaughter."
