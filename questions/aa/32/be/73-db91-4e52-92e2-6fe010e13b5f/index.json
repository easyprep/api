  "question": "If A and B together can complete a work in 18 days, A and C together in 12 days and B and C together in 9 days, then in how many days B alone can do the work?",
  "option1": "18 days",
  "option2": "24 days",
  "option3": "30 days",
  "option4": "40 days",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "24 days",
  "explanation": "(A + B)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{18}&s=1$\r\n(B + C)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{9}&s=1$\r\n(C + A)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{12}&s=1$\r\nOn adding all above equations, we get\r\n2 (A +B + C)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{18} + \\\\frac{1}{9} + \\\\frac{1}{12} = \\\\frac{2+4+3}{36} = \\\\frac{9}{36} = \\\\frac{1}{4}&s=1$\r\nâˆ´ (A + B + C)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{8}&s=1$\r\nNow, B\\'s 1 day\\'s work = (A + B + C)\\'s 1 day\\'s work - (A + C)\\'s 1 day\\'s work \r\n$latex = \\\\frac{1}{8}-\\\\frac{1}{12}=\\\\frac{3-2}{24}=\\\\frac{1}{24}&s=1$\r\nHence B alone can do the work in 24 days. So option [B] is correct answer"
