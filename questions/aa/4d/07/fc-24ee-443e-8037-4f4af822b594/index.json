  "question": "Secularism is one of the fundamental tenets of Indian Constitution. With this reference, consider the following observations:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The constituent assembly adopted a preamble with express declaration of India being a secular state</li>\r\n<li>In India, the parties with religious affiliations are banned from contesting elections</li>\r\n<li>The constitution guarantees both individual and collective freedom of religion</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above observations is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "Only 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "The express declaration of India as a secular state came only with the 42nd amendment and only after that Preamble proclaimed India as a secular state. The second statement is NOT correct because we have \\\"right to be free from religious rule\\\" and not \\\"freedom from religious rule\\\" as such."
