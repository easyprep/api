  "option1": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1, 3 & 5",
  "option4": "Only 2, 3, 4 & 5",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "Increased NRI deposits are an external debt. Inward remittance is not because it is not to be repaid back. ECBs are again external debt. Grants are never debt because they don't need to be paid back. Depreciation of US dollar against the rupee will reduce external debt as rupee getting stronger."
