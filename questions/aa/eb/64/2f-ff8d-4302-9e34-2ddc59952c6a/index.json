  "question": "What will happen to the level of water, when the ice floating in a glass of water melts?",
  "option1": "Increase",
  "option2": "Decrease",
  "option3": "Remain constant",
  "option4": "First increase and then decrease",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Remain constant",
  "explanation": "The water level remains the same when the ice cube melts. A floating object displaces an amount of water equal to its own weight. Since water expands when it freezes, one ounce of frozen water has a larger volume than one ounce of liquid water."
