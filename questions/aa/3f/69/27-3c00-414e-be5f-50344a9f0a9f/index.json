  "question": "British troops were recently involved in shifting of Black Rhinos from South Africa to Malawi for conservation. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The black rhino is a critically endangered animal.</li>\r\n<li>It has square shaped lips to help in grazing.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe Black Rhino is a critically endangered animal. It is native to the eastern and southern parts of Africa. Its skin color varies from brown to grey, not black. There are several subspecies which are extinct like southern black rhino and the north eastern black rhino.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe black rhino is noted for its hook shaped pointed lips. This is to aid in browsing for food as opposed to grazing. The related species, white rhino is noted for its square shaped lips to help in grazing- a morphological adaptation to suit its feeding behaviour."
