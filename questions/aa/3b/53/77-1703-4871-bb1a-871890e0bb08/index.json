  "explanation": "• The Ganges basin is a part of the Ganges-Brahmaputra basin draining 1,086,000 square kilometres in Tibet, Nepal, India and Bangladesh. To the north, the Himalaya or lower parallel ranges beyond form the Ganges-Brahmaputra divide. On the west the Ganges Basin borders the Indus basin and then the Aravalli ridge.<br />• The Indus River Basin is one of the most important water systems in the world. From its headwaters on the Tibetan Plateau, the Indus River flows for 3,200 km across northern India and the length of Pakistan before emptying into the Arabian Sea.<br />• The second largest river in South America, the Parana River, originates at the confluence of the Grande and Paranaiba rivers in South Eastern Brazil. <br />• The Zambezi River rises in the Kalene hills in north-western Zambia and flows northwards for about 30 km. It then turns west and south to run over about 280 km through Angola and reenters Zambia with an annual discharge of nearly 18 km3. It then flows southwards through marshy plains."
