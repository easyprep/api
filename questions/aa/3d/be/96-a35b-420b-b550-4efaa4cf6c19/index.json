After the Mexican War of Independence (1810-1821) and the victory of the Mexican Empire, which leads to the independence of Costa Rica from Spain, Battle of Ochomogo took place in Costa Rica in 1823 to decide whether to join Mexican Empire or not. The Republicans, who defended full independence of Costa Rica from Mexican Empire, won the battle and annexed Costa Rica into the Federal Republic of Central America. In 1838, due to the differences Costa Rica withdrew and proclaimed itself sovereign."
