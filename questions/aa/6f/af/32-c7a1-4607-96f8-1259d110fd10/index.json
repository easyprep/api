  "question": "The Proposed Etalin Hydroelectric Project, sometimes seen in news, is associated to which state?",
  "option1": "Odisha",
  "option2": "Tripura",
  "option3": "Punjab",
  "option4": "Arunachal Pradesh",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Arunachal Pradesh",
  "explanation": "The Union government has recommended a biodiversity study of the proposed 3,097 MW Etalin Hydroelectric Project in Arunachal Pradesh by a credible international institute since the current environmental impact assessment was found to be completely inadequate.Â  The project is estimated to cost Rs 25,296.95 crore & is proposed to be completed in 7 years. But, the project would entail felling 2,80,677 trees and threatens the existence of 6 globally-endangered mammal species. The area also has 680 species of birds, which is about 56% of the total avian species found in India. The Forest Advisory Committee of the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has also advised caution in pursuing the project since it falls under the richest bio-geographical province of the Himalayan zone and would be located at the junction of the Palaearctic, Indo-Chinese and Indo-Malayan bio-geographic regions."
