  "question": "Which among the following special features of Indus Valley Civilization are also found in the contemporary Civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia?<br> 1. Use of Cotton<br> 2. Well Built Houses of the Citizens<br> Choose the correct option:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "Marshall compares and contrasts the Indus Valley civilization with those of contemporary Egypt and Mesopotamia: &#8216;Thus, to mention only a few salient points, the use of cotton for textiles was exclusively restricted at this period to India and was not extended to the western world until 2,000 or 3,000 years later. Again, there is nothing that we know of in prehistoric Egypt or Mesopotamia or anywhere else in western Asia to compare with the well-built baths and commodious houses of the citizens of Mohenjodaro. In these countries much money and thought were lavished on the building of magnificent temples for the gods and on the palaces and tombs of kings, but the rest of the people seemingly had to content themselves with insignificant dwellings of mud. In the Indus Valley the picture is reversed and the finest structures are those erected for the convenience of the citizens.&#8217; These public and private baths, as well as the excellent drainage system we find at Mohenjo-daro, are the first of their kind yet discovered anywhere."
