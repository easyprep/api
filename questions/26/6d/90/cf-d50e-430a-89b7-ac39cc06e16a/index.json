  "explanation": "Only 1 &amp; 4 are correct statements. <span style=\"color: #000000;font-family: Bookman Old Style\">A strongly basic (or alkaline) solution has a high concentration of OH- ions and few H+ ions, whereas a strong acid has higher concentration of H+ ions and lower OH- ions. Acids turn blue litmus red and bases turns red litmus blue.</span> &nbsp;"
