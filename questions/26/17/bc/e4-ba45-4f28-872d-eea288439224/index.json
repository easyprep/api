  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "The first statement is correct. he Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana (PMRPY) Plan Scheme has been designed to incentivise employers for generation of new employment, where Government of India will be paying the 8.33% EPS contribution of the employer for the new employment. This scheme has a dual benefit, where, on the one hand, the employer is incentivised for increasing the employment base of workers in the establishment, and on the other hand, a large number of workers will find jobs in such establishments. A direct benefit is that these workers will have access to social security benefits of the organized sector. The PMRPY scheme is targeted for employees earning wages less than or equal to Rs 15,000/- per month. Thus, new employees earning wages more than Rs 15,001/- per month will not be eligible."
