  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 only",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe Institute of Eminence scheme was launched to improve the higher education sector in India. Under this scheme, the government will identify 20 institutes, 10 each from the public and the private sector, as IoEs and provide concessions- pecuniary and regulatory- to aid their entry into the top 500 ranks of world renowned institutes.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe IoE scheme does not give funding support to private institutes. It only provides concessions in terms of lesser regulations. The scheme also allows the institutes to frame their own syllabus, set fees, etc. The scheme provides 1000 crore INR to public institutes.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nCertain institutes are declared to be of national importance under various government acts. They would continue to function under these acts even after being declared IoE. They would, however, enjoy greater flexibility. Eg: IITs established under the Indian Institutes of Technology Act, 1961.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe scheme provides for including not only established and well performing institutes, but also green-field institutes. Under this category, proposed institutions can also apply for IoE tagging. These institutes have to provide their development plan for 15 years. It must also satisfy conditions like possession of land, capital, etc.  If it satisfies these criteria, it receives a ‘letter of intent’ and after 3 years of proven operation, receives the IoE tag. This year, Airtel’s Satya Bharti Foundation was added under the list.\n&nbsp;"
