It provides for dental care, in addition to geriatric care, child care, pregnancy care etc. Oral health care is one of the most expensive with an average of 5% of total health expenditure around the world. It demands capacities that are beyond most low and middle income countries around the world.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nOral disorders are the most prevalent medical condition in India. The condition has remained so for the last 3 decades. The reasons are due to tobacco, alcohol, sugar etc. Some of the leading disorders are tooth decay, oral cancer and gum infections. It has a major impact on the quality of life and also the economy of the people.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nSouth Asia has the highest prevalence of oral cancers. The incidence of oral disorders have consistently increased in lower and middle income countries according to the report. South Asia accounts for 12.84 billion USD of expenditure on direct treatments for dental disorders.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is correct:\nThe report highlighted the huge incidence of the problem- half the world. Dental decay is reported to be the most common health issue in the world. The issue is especially prevalent among the vulnerable and socially disadvantaged sections. It affects 3.5 billion people across the world irrespective of where they live. Treat-over-prevent model of dentistry is one of the causes."
