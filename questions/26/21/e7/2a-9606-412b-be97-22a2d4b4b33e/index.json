  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "In India, the white winged wood duck is limited to Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. Due to its ghostly call, it is called &lsquo;Deo Hans&rsquo; or Spirit Duck in Assamese.&nbsp;Pink headed duck is a large&nbsp;diving duck that was once found in parts of the Gangetic plains of India, Bangladesh and in the riverine swamps of Myanmar but feared extinct.&nbsp;Its decline likely resulted from habitat loss. Clearance of forest and conversion of wetlands for agricultural land has destroyed much of its habitat. White headed duck is a sparse winter visitor in&nbsp;India.&nbsp;&nbsp;This duck is known to reside in Spain, North Africa, western and central Asia.&nbsp;"
