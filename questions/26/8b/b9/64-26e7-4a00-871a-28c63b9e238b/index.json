  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe IMI 2.0 is to be launched on October 31<sup>st</sup>, 2019. This is in context with the silver jubilee of Pulse Polio Program. The IMI 2.0 will cover the immunisation of all children below 2 years and also pregnant women. It will especially focus on areas with low immunisation coverage.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe IMI 2.0 seeks to improve the immunisation cover across the country. The current immunisation coverage rate is about 87%. Vaccination hesitancy is a key impediment along with large population, availability of facilities, qualified personnel, etc. also posing challenges for achieving 100% immunisation cover.\n&nbsp;"
