  "question": "Which country does not share a border with Egypt?",
  "option1": "Israel",
  "option2": "Libya",
  "option3": "Sudan",
  "option4": "Syria",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Syria",
  "explanation": "Syria does not share a border with Egypt. Egypt is a Mediterranean country located in the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia. Egypt is bordered by the Gaza Strip (under the administration of Palestine) and Israel to the northeast; Sudan to the south; Libya to the west. The Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea form the coastlines of Egypt to the north and east respectively. Gulf of Aqaba lies to the east of Egypt, across which lies Jordan. The Red Sea lies to the east of Egypt, across which lies Saudi Arabia. The Mediterranean Sea lies to the north of Egypt, across which Egypt shares maritime borders with Greece, Turkey and Cyprus. Egypt is bordered by Libya to the west, Sudan to the south, and the Gaza Strip and Israel to the east. Egypt's important role in geopolitics stems from its strategic position: a transcontinental nation, it possesses a land bridge (the Isthmus of Suez) between Africa and Asia, traversed by a navigable waterway (the Suez Canal) that connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Indian Ocean by way of the Red Sea. The capital of Egypt is Cairo, which is the largest metropolitan area in Africa, the Arab world and the middle east and is located near to the Nile Delta. The official currency of Egypt is Egyptian Pound, issued by the Central Bank of Egypt."
