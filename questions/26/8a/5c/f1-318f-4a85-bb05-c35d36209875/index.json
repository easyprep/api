  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Ostional Wildlife Reserve is in Costa Rica. It is one of the most important nesting sites for Olive Ridley Sea Turtles. The reserve sees the periodic arribada event. In 2019, over 300,000 female turles nested in the region.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe turtle-watching is a popular tourist attraction in this area. Tourists flock to watch the arribada nesting event. However, because of reports of tourist activities interfering with the nesting of the turtles, the reserve has started restricting tourism here. Turtle-watching is allowed only when accompanied by a licensed guide.\n&nbsp;"
