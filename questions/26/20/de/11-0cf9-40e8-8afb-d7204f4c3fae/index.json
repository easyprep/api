  "option2": "Only 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3 are correct",
  "option4": "Only 3 is correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 3 are correct",
  "explanation": "In India, the concept of the whip was inherited from colonial British rule. Every major political party appoints a whip who is responsible for the party\\'s discipline and behaviour on the floor of the house. Usually, he/she directs the party members to stick to the party\\'s stand on certain issues and directs them to vote as per the direction of senior party members. However, there are some cases such as Indian presidential election where no whip can be issued directing Member of Parliament or Member of Legislative Assembly on whom to vote. Political parties cannot issue any direction or whip to members to vote or not in Presidential poll as it would be an offence and MPs and MLAs will not risk disqualification under Anti-Defection law in the process."
