  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "King cobra, one of the very few nest-building snakes, drags dead vegetation into a low heap by bending its body. The eggs are laid in a cavity at the centre of nest. Other snakes deposit their eggs in holes they have scooped out of sand or soft earth with their snout. Second statement is correct. Third is partially incorrect.
