  "question": "Consider the following general observation about the distribution of wealth in the world in terms of geography:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Continents along the equator are poorest, while the nations farthest from the equator are wealthier</li>\r\n<li>Within the wealthy continents, and even within large countries, wealth increases with distance from the equator.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above observations is/ are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "Geography and wealth have long been perceived as correlated attributes of nations. The continents along the equator, Africa and South America, are the poorest. Even within Africa and South America this effect can be seen, as the nations farthest from the equator are wealthier. In Africa the wealthiest nations are the three on the southern tip of the continent, South Africa, Botswana, and Namibia, and the countries of North Africa. Similarly in Latin America Argentina, Peru, Chile , and Uruguay have long been the wealthiest. Within Asia, Indonesia, located on the equator, is among the poorest. Within Central Asia, Kazakhstan is wealthier than other former Soviet Republics which border it to the south, like Uzbekistan. <br />The wealthiest nations of the world with the highest standard of living tend to be those at the northern extreme of areas open to human habitation, Canada, and the Nordic Countries. Within the wealthy continents, and even within large countries, wealth increases with distance from the equator. Southern Europe has long been poorer than its northern counterpart, as has the Southern United States."
