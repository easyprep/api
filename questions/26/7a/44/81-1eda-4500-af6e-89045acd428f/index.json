  "question": "In context of the recent discoveries regarding the evolution of the straight tusked elephants, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The straight tusked elephant populations originated in Asia.</li>\n<li>The Indian species had a more slender skull than the European species of the straight tusked elephant.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe straight tusked elephant is an extinct mammal species. It migrated out of Africa to other continents- Asia, Europe etc. They are noted for their enormous heads- about 4.5 feet from roof of skull to the tusk sheathâ€™s base.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Indian branch of the species, Palaeoloxodon namadicus, was noted to have had a more robust and broader skull than the European branch of the species, called Palaeoloxodon antiquus. The Japanese branch of the species is the Palaeoloxodon naumanni. All three branches are extinct."
