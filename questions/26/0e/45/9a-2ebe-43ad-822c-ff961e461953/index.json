It houses 40% of the world's total population of musk oxen. It has a coastline of 18000 km in total and includes both the highest parts of the Northern Hemisphere's largest ice cap and the world's northernmost area of land. It's very difficult to have a visit to this national park as only about 500 people are allowed to visit this national park every year. It is the farthest northern national park out of all the national parks in the world and the only national park in Greenland. It was the first national park to be created in the Kingdom of Denmark."
