  "question": "The recent IPCC report highlighted the issue of marine heat-waves. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Over the years marine heat-waves have been decreasing in frequency</li>\n<li>The marine heat-wave called ‘the Blob’ affected the Atlantic Ocean.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nMarine heatwaves are phenomenon in which the seas experience unusually warm temperatures. The recent report by the IPCC shows that the incidence of marine heatwaves has doubled since 1982. It is expected to increase by 20 to 50 times by the year 2081 in absence of mitigating measures.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe marine heatwave, ‘the Blob’ affected the Pacific Ocean in 2014-15. The heatwave affected the region ranging from Hawaii to Alaska. The marine heatwaves can kill off coral reefs, cause stranding of marine animals like sea lions and drastically affect the fishing and crabbing industries.\n&nbsp;"
