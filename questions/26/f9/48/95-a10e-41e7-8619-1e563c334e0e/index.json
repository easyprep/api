  "question": "Which among the following is / are correct statements with respect to the Prajapatya Vivaha:<br> 1. The rights of boy and girl were equally secured<br> 2. The bride&#8217;s father agreed for a fixed price, generally a pair of cows<br> Select the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "In Prajapatya Vivaha, the rights of boy and girl were equally secured. The groom approached the father of the bride and the father of the bride would agree on certain conditions BUT not certain price. The second statement pertains to the Arsha Vivaha, in which the bride&#8217;s father used to receive a pair of cattle for certain uses prescribed by the law. But still it was NOT a price of the bride. It was only the Asura Vivah in which the groom&#8217;s family paid to the bride&#8217;s family in return for the girl."
