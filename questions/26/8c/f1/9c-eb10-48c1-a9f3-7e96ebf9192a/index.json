  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Bru Reang tribes are to be settled in Tripura. This is in accordance with the quadripartite agreement recently signed among the central government, the governments of Mizoram and Tripura and representatives from the Bru Reang community. The agreement has covered settlement of 34,000 members.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Bru Reang people are scheduled tribe of Tripura. They had fled during ethnic violence from Mizoram in 1997 leading to displacement of 5,000 families. This accounts for 30,000 internally displaced people. The centre is to aid their rehabilitation with a 600 crore INR package."
