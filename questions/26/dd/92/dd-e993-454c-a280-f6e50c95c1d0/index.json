  "answer": "Nagaland",
  "explanation": "On December 1, Nagaland became the first state in the northeastern region and 2nd in the country after Himachal Pradesh to adopt  a Pan-India single emergency number ‘112’ under ERSS ( Emergency Response Support System) project. It was launched by  the  Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh at Kohima, which coincided with the Formation Day of Nagaland and the inaugural day of Hornbill Festival 2018.   Now, the residents can dial 112 or use Panic Button on their phones or 112 India mobile App to connect to a single number based 112 emergency services which will connect to Police, Fire, Health and other helplines through an Emergency Response Centre in the State.  As a special feature, to ensure safety of women, a unique ‘SHOUT’ feature has been introduced in 112 India mobile App. This allows victims to seek immediate assistance from registered volunteers in the vicinity apart from contacting Emergency Response Centre. The SHOUT feature is exclusively available to women."
