  "option1": "Bishangarh",
  "option2": "Nimriwali",
  "option3": "Godikan",
  "option4": "Ishapur Kheri",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Godikan",
  "explanation": "Dharampal, the Sarpanch of Godikan village panchayat in Haryana, has passed a \\'No Toilet No Bride\\' resolution to ensure the safety and well-being of its womenfolk. The move is aimed at ensuring the security of their daughters in addition to hygiene. With this move, the Godikan panchayat has become the first panchayat in the country to marry off girls only to families who have a toilet in their house. The village apparently was inspired by the super hit Hindi movie starring Akshay Kumar - \\'Toilet-Ek Prem Katha\\'. Godikan panchayat has already been declared an Outdoor Defecation Free (ODF) panchayat."
