  "option1": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "Only 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "<p class=\\\"Notes\\\">Thermal history is something which is more commonly related to Igneous rocks. Sedimentary rocks are important because they preserve a record of ancient landscapes, climates, and mountain ranges, as well as the history of the erosion of Earth. In addition, fossils are found in abundance in sedimentary rocks younger than 600 million years and provide evidence of the evolution of life through time. Earthâ€™s geologic time scale was worked out using this record of sedimentary rocks and fossils."
