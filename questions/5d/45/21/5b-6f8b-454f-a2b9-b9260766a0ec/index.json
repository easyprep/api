  "option4": "Saudi Arabia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Saudi Arabia",
  "explanation": "Saudi Arabia has abolished its age-old rule that mandated separate entrances and seating areas for men and women. The gulf nation\\'s Municipal and Rural Affairs Ministry lifted the ban through a twitter announcement. Earlier, all restaurants in Saudi Arabia were required to have one entrance for women and families and another entrance for men dining on their own. Unrelated men and women were barred for decades from mixing in public places. This was decreed by the strict social rules put in place decades ago by the hardline clerics."
