  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about Salinity of ocean water?<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Seawater density varies with temperature, degree of salinity, and depth.</li>\r\n<li>Deep water has low density.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "Seawater density varies with temperature, degree of salinity, and depth. <br />High temperature produces low density, and high salinity produces high density.<br />Deep water has high density because of low temperature and because of the pressure of the overlying water."
