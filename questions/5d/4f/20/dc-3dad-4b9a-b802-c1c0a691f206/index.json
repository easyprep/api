  "question": "What is the direction of flow of energy in an ecosystem?",
  "option1": "Unidirectional",
  "option2": "Bidirectional",
  "option3": "Multidirectional",
  "option4": "Cyclic",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Unidirectional",
  "explanation": "The energy enters the plants from the sun through the photosynthesis process. This energy is then passed on from one organism to another in a food chain. The flow of energy in the ecosystem is unidirectional because the energy lost as heat from the living organisms of a food chain cannot be reused by plants in photosynthesis. During the transfer of energy through successive trophic levels in an ecosystem, there is a loss of energy all along the path."
