  "question": "With respect to the recent call for increasing awareness about the Ethics Committee in Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Any person can lodge a complaint against a parliamentary member through the ethics committee.</li>\r\n<li>The Lok Sabha does not have an ethics committee.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",

  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe ethics committee is one of the inquiry committees of the parliament. The ethics committee is to deal with the ethical conduct of the parliamentary members. Any person can make a complaint about a parliamentary memberâ€™s unethical conduct to the committee.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nBoth houses of the parliament has its own ethic committee. The Rajya Sabha had set up its ethics committee in 1997 and was the first of its kind in the country. The committee is in news for the poor awareness about the proper procedure for submitting the complaints to the committee."
