  "option3": 0.0375,
  "option4": 0.04,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 0.0375,
  "explanation": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor has recently announced that the reverse repo rate has been cut by 25 basis points to 3.75%.\r\nThis announcement has been made by the RBI in its efforts towards increasing liquidity amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. As the repo rate has been kept unchanged at 4.4%, the spread between the repo and reverse repo has been widened. This encourages the banks to lend the money instead of parking it with the RBI."
