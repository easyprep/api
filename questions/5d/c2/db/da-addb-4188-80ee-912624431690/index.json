  "question": "Which of the following observations conform to the Equatorial Climate?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Daily range of temperature is higher than the annual range</li>\r\n<li>There is a double maxima of rain­fall coinciding with the vertical sun in this climate</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Both are correct statements.  Equatorial climate is a tropical climate where rainfall occurs almost every day in the afternoon through convection in the form of showers. Although rainfall occurs in all months, but the maximum rain is associated with the period when the ITC is located in this region. Therefore, there is a double maxima of rain­fall coinciding with the vertical sun."
