  "option1": "3 and 4",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 and 2",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Pench tiger sanctuary is found on the border of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. The tiger census 2018 report shows that it has the highest number of tigers, besides the Periyar sanctuary in Kerala. It is named after the Pench River that flows through it.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe census evaluated the tiger numbers in 50 sanctuaries across the country. They were grouped into 5 geographical clusters: Central India and Eastern Ghats, Western Ghats, North-east and Brahmaputra, Shivalik Hills and Gangetic plain and the Sundarbans. Highest numbers occur in the Central Indian and Eastern Ghats region.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nChattisgarh is the least performing state in the aspect of ‘reserve management’. Least scoring sanctuaries are the Dampa sanctuary of Mizoram and Rajaji sanctuary of Uttarakhand. A score of more than or equal to 41% was considered ‘fair’ performance.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe 2014 census result was topped by Karnataka and named ‘tiger state’. This census, the post was taken over by MP state. The central Indian state had held the position in the 2000s but had lost out to Karnataka and Uttarakhand over the years due to high poaching fatalities. This time, the state has reclaimed the status of ‘tiger state’.\n&nbsp;"
