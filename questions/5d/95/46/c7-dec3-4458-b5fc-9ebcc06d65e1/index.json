  "option1": "Greece",
  "option2": "Italy",
  "option3": "Egypt",
  "option4": "Iran",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Egypt",
  "explanation": "Thebes, the city of the god Amon, was the capital of Egypt during the period of the Middle and New Kingdoms. With the temples and palaces at Karnak and Luxor, and the necropolises of the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens, Thebes is a striking testimony to Egyptian civilization at its height. Thebes included the monumental Karnak temple complex (above), as well as the Valley of the Kings or Valley of the Gates of the Kings. The magnificent monuments of Ancient Thebes stand proudly near the banks of the Nile around the modern city of Luxor in Upper Egypt, about 500 km south of Cairo. They include the Temples of Luxor and Karnak within the city, and the Colossi of Memnon, the temples of Deir al-Bahri and Medinat Habu and the concealed tombs of the Valleys of the Kings and Queens on the west bank. Today Thebes has some of the finest monuments, and most precious relics of ancient Egypt, including the extraordinary collections of art and artefacts in the tombs of the kings and queens, notably that of the young pharaoh Tutankhamun."
