  "question": "Consider the following comparisons of Diesel with Gasoline:<br> 1. In comparison to Gasoline, Diesel offers low volumetric energy density<br> 2. In comparison to Gasoline, Diesel is cheap all over the world<br> 3. In comparison to Gasoline, CO2 emissions from diesel are higher<br> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "1 & 2",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "None of them",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of them",
  "explanation": "Diesel is not cheaper than gasoline or petrol in all countries. When burned, Diesel offers a net heating value of 43.1 MJ/kg as opposed to 43.2 MJ/kg for gasoline. However, due to the higher density, diesel offers a higher volumetric energy density. CO2 emissions from diesel are slightly lower than for gasoline."
