  "option2": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Kindly note that the <u>cess and surcharges are not part of the divisible pool of central taxes</u>. The share of cess and surcharges in gross tax revenue of the Union government increased from 7.53% in 2000-01 to 13.14% in 2013-14. <strong>From Finance Commission Report: </strong> Almost all States have argued that cess and surcharges should form part of the divisible pool, with some suggesting that this should be done if cess and surcharges continue for more than three years. A few States have proposed a minimum guaranteed tax devolution to insulate States' finances from the volatility of Union revenues for the purpose of predictability of transfer and stability in the management of State finances"
