  "answer": "Sadar Diwani Adalat",
  "explanation": "Under the Scheme of 1793, the Sadar Diwani Adalat which consisted of the Governor-General and Council continued to be the highest Civil Court subject to appeals to the King-in-Council when the subject-matter of the dispute was of the value of Â£ 5,000 or more. But one important reform introduced by the scheme was that Sadar Diwani Adalat was also constituted as a Court of Supervision and Inspection over the Mofussil Diwani Adalats so that administration of justice could be toned up."
