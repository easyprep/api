  "question": "&nbsp; &nbsp;Consider the following compounds: <ol> <li>Water</li> <li>Carbon dioxide</li> <li>Carbon monoxide</li> </ol> &nbsp;Which of the above is/are organic compound/compounds?",
  "option1": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option2": "1 Only",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "None",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None",
  "explanation": "Organic compounds not only have carbon bonds but also contain hydrocarbons or carbon bonded to hydrogen. A few types of carbon-containing compounds, such as&nbsp;carbides,&nbsp;carbonates, simple&nbsp;oxides&nbsp;of carbon (such as CO and CO<sub>2</sub>), and&nbsp;cyanides&nbsp;are considered&nbsp;inorganic. Water does not contain any&nbsp;carbon atom&nbsp;in its molecule, H2O. So water is only an&nbsp;inorganic compound."
