  "explanation": "The World Red Cross Day (WRCD) is observed every year on May 8 to recognize the extraordinary contribution and incredible achievements of the stalwarts and volunteers around the world for helping the people in need anytime, anywhere. It is a gentle nod to all the volunteers who have made unparalleled contribution to people in need. The day is also known as World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day. This date is the anniversary of the birth of Henry Dunant, who was born on 8 May 1828. He was the founder of International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the recipient of the first Nobel Peace Prize. The 2019 theme is “#love” or simply \\\"love\\\", which will focus on broadening people\\'s understanding of the society by highlighting diversity and universality of work and approach of Red Cross.  On this special day, several blood donation camps will be organised around the world and this day also offers an opportunity to provide voluntary medical services to society."
