The committee has examined security mechanisms of all four Indian states sharing border with Pakistan keeping in mind challenges of different climate and topography. It has given separate recommendations for four states as each of them has different topography and problems. It has flagged gaps and vulnerabilities in border fencing and suggested use of technology and heightened vigil on riverine frontiers. It has expressed displeasure over not installing laser walls in many infiltration-prone areas due to treacherous and marshy terrain."
