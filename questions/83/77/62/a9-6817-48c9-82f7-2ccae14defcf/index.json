  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nNon-resident Indians/ NRIs are not allowed to invest in this scheme. HUFs/ Hindu Undivided Families are also not eligible under this scheme. HUFs are considered as a ‘person’ by the Income Tax Act. The HUF is considered as a separate entity for assessment.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe SCSS holder is eligible to tax benefits under the Income Tax Act, 1961. This is by the provisions of the section 80C of the IT Act. The section provides tax deductions for certain eligible members. Other schemes like Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, Public Provident Fund, National Savings Certificate scheme, etc. are covered under this section."
