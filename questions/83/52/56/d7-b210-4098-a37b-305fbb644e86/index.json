  "question": "With reference to the Trikaya doctrine, consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Trikaya doctrine is one of the basic concept in Hinayana tradition of Buddhism</li>\r\n<li>Trikaya doctrine was largely developed by Yogacara School</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "Trikayas Doctrine says that Buddha has three kayas or bodies, the nirmanakaya or created body which manifests in time and space; the sambhogakaya or body of enjoyment which is a body of bliss or clear light manifestation; and the Dharmakaya or Truth body which embodies the very principle of enlightenment and knows no limits or boundaries. The later development of Mahayan Buddhism adopted this theory. The Yogacarins are credited with the development of Trikaya Doctrine. The theory was formulated in answer to a paradox which confronted Mahayana Buddhism. Whereas the truc ideal of early Buddhism was the arahant, this was replaced in the Mahayana by the bodhisattva. Yet if this was the true ideal, why did Siddhartha Gautama not become a bodhisattva, rather man a Buddha who selfishly passed away at parinirvana? This objection was addressed in the Yogacarinsâ€™ concept of the Trikaya. They said that Gautama was not in fact an ordinary man, but the manifestation o f a great spirituaJ being. The Buddha had three bodies -the Body of Essence (dharmakaya), the Body of Bliss (sambhogakaya), and the Body of Magic Transformation (ninnanakaya)."
