He was the greatest ruler of the Rastrakuta Empire. He indulged in constant wars with the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi and remained successful. Amoghavarsha was a patron of the Jains and liberally patronized the Digambara sect of Jains.\r\nHis contribution led to rapid progress made by the Digambara Jain sect in the 9th and 10 th century under Jinasena and Gunabhadra. (As evident from Mahapurana). Both of these Digambar Jain monks enjoyed favor of more than one monarchs and much responsible to eclipse Buddhism."
