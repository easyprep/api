The day is intended to provide an opportunity to bring attention to activities that are connected with the dairy sector. Interestingly, this is an event which does not follow a specific theme worldwide. Instead, different countries, governments and non-governmental organizations get to pick a theme of their own. The WMD 2018 theme in India is \\\"Drink Move Be Strong\\\". Milk is enriched with nutrients like calcium, protein, vitamin B2, potassium, iodine, etc."
