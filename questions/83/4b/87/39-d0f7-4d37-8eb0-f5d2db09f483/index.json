  "option1": "John Maynard Keynes",
  "option2": "J S Mill",
  "option3": "Milton Friedman",
  "option4": "Adam Smith",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "John Maynard Keynes",
  "explanation": "British economist, John Maynard Keynes, argued against the long-held view that free markets would automatically provide full employment, spearheading a revolution in economic thinking. He proposed that state intervention is required during boom and bust cycles of the economy, a policy adopted by most western economies during the thirties. This went out of fashion by the seventies, but the world still looks to the Keynesian policy during economic crises."
