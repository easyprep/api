  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Recently, the State Governments of Maharashtra and Gujarat have proposed to sign agreement on the Damanganga-Pinjal river inter-linking project. The Damanganga-Pinjal project proposes to divert the surplus water of the Bhugad and Khargihill reservoirs in the Damanganga basin to Mumbai, via the Pinjal dam on the Pinjal River in the Vaitarna basin. The project is expected to provide 909 MLD (million litres per day) water daily, which will ensure safe drinking water supply to Mumbai till 2060. Recently, the Central Water Commission (CWC) accorded inter-state clearance to the Kaleshwaram irrigation project. The Kaleshwaram project is an off-shoot of the original Pranahitha-Chevella Lift Irrigation Scheme. The Kaleshwaram project has provision for the storage of about 148 tmc ft with plans of utilising 180 tmc ft by lifting at-least 2 tmc ft water every day for 90 flood days. The project is designed to irrigate 738851 hectares of land. The projects include one of the largest tunnel to carry water in Asia, running up to 81 km, between the Yellampally barrage and the Mallannasagar reservoir.  Kalasa-Banduri project is a part of the Mahadayi river water-sharing plan between Goa &amp; Karnataka. Karnataka plans to divert a meagre 7.56 tmc of its Mahadayi basin contribution to the Malaprabha dam to meet the drinking water needs of the twin cities of Hubballi-Dharwad and the surrounding towns and villages. The plan is to channelise the diverted water through Kalasa-Banduri, two separate canals so that water could be supplied to the twin cities and Nargund, Navalgund, Badami, Ron, Gadag and 100 villages."
