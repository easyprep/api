  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The force exerted on the surface by the column of air above it is called atmospheric pressure or air pressure. A change in either temperature or density will cause a corresponding change in the air pressure. A rising pressure indicates fine, settled weather whereas a falling pressure indicates unstable and cloudy weather."
