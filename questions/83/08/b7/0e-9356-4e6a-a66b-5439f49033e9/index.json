  "answer": 1910,
  "explanation": "On 12 December 1911, King George V announced shifting of capital from Calcutta to New Delhi. One of the underlying reason was that Bengal had become dangerous ground due to revolutionaries for British. On 15 December 1911, the foundation stone of New Delhi was laid by King George V at Kingsway Camp. Large parts of New Delhi were planned by Edwin Lutyens. The contract was given to Sir Sobha Singh (Khushwant Singhâ€™s father). Construction really began after WW-I and was completed by 1931."
