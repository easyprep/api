  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "One of the most important environmental factors that affect the Taiga Forests is Wildfires. Wildfires have been an integral part of the Taiga environment for several thousand years. The main natural reason of the wildfires in Taiga is lightening strikes. However, the spread of the fire is dependent on weather, soil conditions, topography and the amount of dry organic matter (fuel) on the soil surface. The combination of these factors forms the fire regime, which is characterized by the intensity, pattern of distribution and type of fire (i.e. ground or crown fire)."
