Organised by Solidarite sida (a French HIV/AIDS awareness group for youth), the event brings together more than 150 artists and 170 000 festival-goers for three days (Friday, Saturday and Sunday). The proceeds from the festival are donated to organisations fighting against HIV/AIDS, especially for those focusing on the African continent. The festival has been held since 1999. The performers involved in Solidays accept a reduced fee or appear for free as a sign of their solidarity."
