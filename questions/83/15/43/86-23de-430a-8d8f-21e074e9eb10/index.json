  "answer": "1 2 3 4 5 6",
  "explanation": "• Latitude. Depending on how close or how far it is to the equator.<br />• Ocean currents. They have different temperatures. Warm ocean currents warm the air above it, which warms the coast. Cold ocean currents cool the air above it, which cools the coast.<br />• Wind and Air masses. Heated ground causes air to rise which results in lower air pressure. As it rises it cools and descends to the ground resulting in high air pressure. This cycle repeats which creates wind. These air masses absorb the climate of the air below it.<br />• Elevation. The higher up you are, the colder and more wet it will be. When air rises it expands due to low air pressure which causes it to cool.<br />• Relief. The differences in the elevation in land. As air is forced to rise over a piece of land (e.g.) a mountain) the temperature decreases and condensation increases. As it condensates water droplets get bigger and heavier and are forced to fall. Once the air mass goes over the mountain the temperature and evaporation increases but condensations decreases, resulting in a hault in precipitation and a rain shadow.<br />• Near Water. Water heats up and cools down slower than land does, having a moderating effect. On colder days, the water heats up the land, whereas on hotter days, the land is cooled down by the water. These areas also experience more precipitation."
