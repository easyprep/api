  "question": "The European Union has recently announced to become the world's first climate neutral economy by which year?",
  "option1": 2060,
  "option2": 2050,
  "option3": 2040,
  "option4": 2030,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 2050,
  "explanation": "The European Union has recently announced a long-term vision on combating climate change  that aims to transform the bloc into the first carbon neutral major economy by 2050 - A Clean Planet for All . Under the plan, emissions of greenhouse gases after that date would have to be offset by planting trees or by burying the gases underground. Its plan will include steps such as investing in realistic technological solutions ( such as solar and wind energy ) to help lower carbon emissions. Thus, scientists said that net-zero emissions by 2050 are needed to have a fighting chance of keeping global temperatures under 1.5C this century.  The Climate neutrality means your emissions are balanced by methods of removing warming gases from the atmosphere. So the warming emissions that are created by cars and power plants should be counteracted by the greenhouse gases removed from the air by the planting of new forests or through carbon capture technologies which would see the CO2 buried underground."
