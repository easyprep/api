  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nIn November, the Supreme Court held that the office of Chief Justice of India is a public office under the Right to Information Act. This was in reply to appeals of General Secretary and the Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) of the Supreme Court.  \n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nAs the CJI office is a public authority, it entertains RTI applications. It will provide information in line with the provisions of the RTI act, 2005. The section 2 of the act defines information as “any material in any form, including records, documents, memos, e-mails, opinions, advices, press releases, circulars, orders, logbooks, contracts, reports, papers, samples, models, data material held in any electronic form and information relating to any private body which can be accessed by a public authority under any other law for the time being in force”."
