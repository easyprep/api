  "question": "Sky looks blue but the sunsets are red. With this reference, consider the following statements: <br> 1.Shorter wavelengths scatter more easily than longer in atmosphere<br> 2.When Sun is close to horizon, there is more scattering of red light<br> Which among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Scattering of all the colors is not done equally by air molecules. Shorter wavelengths (violet blue-green) scatter more easily than longer (yellow-orange-red) in the atmosphere. Sunlight consists of seven colours and the red has the maximum wavelength. During sunrise and sunset, it gets closed to the horizon and travels larger parts of the atmosphere. So except for the red colour, others get scattered away and Sun looks red."
