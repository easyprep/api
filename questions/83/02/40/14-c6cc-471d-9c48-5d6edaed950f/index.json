  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "The first statement is correct and is a notable point. Please note that elections are taking place there since 1970s. The second statement needs to looked into. The legislature of the European Union is principally composed of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. Competencies in scrutinizing and amending legislation are usually divided equally between the two, while the power to initiate laws is held by the European Commission. National parliaments also have a minor delaying power. Here we must note that Parliament and Council can be regarded as two chambers in a bicameral legislative branch of the European Union, with law-making power being officially distributed equally between both parliamentary chambers. The Council is not the lower house as mentioned in statement 2."
