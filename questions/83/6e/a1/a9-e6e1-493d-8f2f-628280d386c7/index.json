  "explanation": "In terms of military prowess, India has ranked 4th out of 133 countries on the Global Firepower (GFP) list 2017. India at 4th rank, trails behind only US, Russia and China. India and China's high rank can be largely attributed to a sizeable number of armed personnel, which is the most important ranking parameter. With 4207250 total armed personnel, India is ahead of China, which has 3712500 total armed personnel. However, China has 2260000 active troops as compared to India's 1362500. Besides, in terms of defence budget allocation, China is much ahead of India. China's defence budget allocation is over three times higher as compared to India. When compared with Pakistan (13th Rank), India is superior on all parameters except the number of attack helicopters, self-propelled artillery and waterway coverage.",
