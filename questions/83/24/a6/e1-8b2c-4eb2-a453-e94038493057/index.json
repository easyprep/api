  "answer": "Greece",
  "explanation": "The Modern Greek Enlightenment, also known as \"Diafotismos\", \"enlightenment,\" \"illumination\", was the Greek expression of the Age of Enlightenment. The Greek Enlightenment was given impetus by the Greek predominance in trade and education in the Ottoman Empire. Greek merchants financed a large number of young Greeks to study in universities in Italy and the German states. There they were introduced to the ideas of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. It was the wealth of the extensive Greek merchant class that provided the material basis for the intellectual revival that was the prominent feature of Greek life in the half-century and more leading to 1821.",
