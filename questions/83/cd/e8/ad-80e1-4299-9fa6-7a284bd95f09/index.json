  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "When temperature of an air mass containing large quantity of water vapour falls all of a sudden, condensation takes place on fine dust &amp; smoke particles. This is called fog. Fog is a cloud with its base at or very near to ground.Â It is formed generally when warm &amp; cold currents meet. Mist is formed frequently over the mountains when rising warm air up the slopes meet cold surfaces.<br />Mist contains more moisture than fog and each nuclei in mist contains thicker layer of moisture.<br /><br />"
