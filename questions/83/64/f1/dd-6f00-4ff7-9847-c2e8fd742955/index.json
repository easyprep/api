  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "3 Only",
  "option3": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "All given statements are correct<br> Growing of two or more than two crops simultaneously on the same piece of land is called inter-cropping. It yields higher productivity per unit area. It is mostly prevalent in plantation crops like coconut and areca nut. Main objectives of intercropping are: <ul><li>Insurance against total crop failure under aberrant weather conditions or pest epidemics</li><li>Increase in total productivity per unit land area</li><li>Judicious utilization of resources such as land, labor and inputs</li></ul>"
