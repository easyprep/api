  "explanation": "The Yekatit 12 Massacre happened in Ethiopia from 19 February 1937 to 21 February 1937, sanctioned by the Italian rulers of Ethiopia in retaliation to the failed assassination attempt of Marshal Rodolfo Graziani, the then Viceroy of Italian East Africa. Graziani has led the Italian forces to victory over the Ethiopians in the Second Italian invasion of Ethiopia. This event led to a massive scale of imprisonment and massacre of Ethiopians which amount from 19200 to 30000 civilians. This also involved the massacre of several members of \"Black lions\", an anti-fascist resistance movement formed to fight against Italy during it's the occupation of the Ethiopian Empire in the World War II. The \"Yekatit 12 Monument\" was unveiled in the city of Addis Ababa to commemorate the victims of the massacre."
