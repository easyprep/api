  "explanation": "• An anemometer is a device used for measuring wind speed and is also a common weather station instrument. The term is derived from the Greek word anemos, which means wind and is used to describe any wind speed instrument used in meteorology.<br />• An ammeter is a measuring instrument used to measure the current in a circuit. Electric currents are measured in amperes.<br />• A tachometer is an instrument measuring the rotation speed of a shaft or disk, as in a motor or other machine. The device usually displays the revolutions per minute on a calibrated analogue dial, but digital displays are increasingly common.<br />• A pyrometer is a type of remote-sensing thermometer used to measure the temperature of a surface. Various forms of pyrometers have historically existed."
