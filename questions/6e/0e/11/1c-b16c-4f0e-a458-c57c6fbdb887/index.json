  "question": "Which among the following is / are correct statements with respect to the Breeder Reactors? <br />1. A breeder reactor produces more fissionable material than it burns<br />2. Breeder reactors are known for low fuel efficiency<br />3. Breeder reactors can be helpful in controlling nuclear waste<br />Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "Breeder reactors are a type of nuclear reactor which produce more fissile materials than they consume.<br />Breeder reactors certainly have the ability to make nuclear fuels quite sustainable.<br />With increased concerns about nuclear waste, breeder reactors reduce actinide wastes, particularly plutonium and minor actinides. Breeder reactors are designed to fission the actinide wastes as fuel, and thus convert them to more fission products."
