Due to fear of Amir Timur, he did not take up any royal title and postulated himself with the titles of Rayat-i-Ala  (Sublime Banners) and Masnad-i-Aali or (Most High Post). During his reign, coins were struck in the name of Amir Timur. In  the reign of Firoz Shah Tughlaq, Khizr Khan was the governor of Multan."
