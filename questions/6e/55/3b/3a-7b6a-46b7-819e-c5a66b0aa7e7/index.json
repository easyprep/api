  "answer": "*99#",
  "explanation": "Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) allows users without a smartphone or data/internet connection to use mobile banking through the *99# code. USSD-based mobile banking can be used for fund transfers, checking account balance, generating bank statement, among other uses. The main objective of the innovative *99# payments service is to allow financial inclusion of the underbanked and economically weaker sections of the society, and integrate them into mainstream banking. The *99# service is also known as National Unified USSD Platform (NUUP)."
