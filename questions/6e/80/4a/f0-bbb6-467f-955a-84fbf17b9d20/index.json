  "question": "&nbsp; &nbsp; Consider the following statements: <ol> <li>Speed of sound increases with increase in density of the medium</li> <li>Speed of sound increases with increase in temperature of the medium</li> </ol> &nbsp;&nbsp; Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 Only",
  "explanation": "When the elasticity of the medium increases&nbsp;the density&nbsp;decreases and it increases the sound speed. Higher temperatures lower the&nbsp;density&nbsp;of a&nbsp;medium, which puts less resistance on the&nbsp;sound&nbsp;waves.&nbsp;"
