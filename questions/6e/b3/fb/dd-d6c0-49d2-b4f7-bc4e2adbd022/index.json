  "explanation": "The Mont-Ford Reforms of 1918 and the GoI Act of 1919 had envisaged their review after 10 years. Accordingly, the Simon Commission, under the chairmanship of Sir John Simon, was set up in 1928. It comprised seven British Members of Parliament of the UK, including the Labour leader Clement Attlee (1883-1967) who was subsequently the British Prime Minister between 1945 and 1951. The Commission was tasked with reporting India's constitutional progress, and for suggesting further constitutional reforms. Outraged at the exclusion of Indians from the Commission that was to determine India’s constitutional future, the Indian National Congress (INC), at its December 1927 meeting in Madras, resolved to boycott the Commission. The Simon Commission, upon its arrival in Bombay on 3 February 1928, was greeted with strikes, protests and black flags. The protests were repeated in each major city the Commission visited, accompanied by the slogan “Simon go back!” A faction of Muslim League, Hindus and Sikhs, however, cooperated with the Commission. An All-India Committee for Cooperation with the Simon Commission was established.<br> The Commission’s two-volume report published in May 1930 proposed, inter alia, abolition of diarchy and the establishment of representative government in the provinces; retention of separate communal electorates until tensions between Hindus and Muslims dies down. The Simon Commission ultimately led to the Government of India Act 1935, which established representative government at the provincial level; and is the basis of many parts of the current Indian Constitution. In accordance with the GoI Act 1935, the first elections were held in the Provinces in 1937 that brought Congress Governments in power in most of the Provinces."
