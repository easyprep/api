  "question": "In context with the Meghalaya government deciding to exclude unrepresented tribes from the VI schedule, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>These tribes are not indigenous to Meghalaya.</li>\n<li>The VI schedule covers Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur and Tripura.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe unrepresented tribes that have been listed for exclusion from the provisions of VI schedule are Rabha, Koch, Mann, Hajong and Bodo Kachari. They are indigenous to the Meghalayan region. They are minor tribes who have been residing there even before 1972.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe VI schedule has provisions for Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram. The schedule gives special provisions for the welfare and development of ST populations in the region. The exclusion of the 5 unrepresented tribes is as a result of the state government’s recommendation for the removal of the term ‘unrepresented tribes’ from the schedule in September."
