  "option1": "South Korea",
  "option2": "North Korea",
  "option3": "Hong Kong",
  "option4": "Thailand",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Hong Kong",
  "explanation": "The legislature of Hong Kong has recently approved a bill that makes it illegal to insult the Chinese national anthem.\r\nIn Hong Kong, the pro-democracy camp sees the anthem bill as an infringement of freedom of expression whereas the pro-Beijing majority said the law was necessary to show appropriate respect for the anthem. If one intentionally abuses the \"March of the Volunteers\" anthem, he might face up to three years in prison and a fine of up to 50,000 Hong Kong dollars."
