  "question": "In context with the recent discussions about the acquisition and cross-servicing agreement/ ACSA between India and Japan, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It will allow the defence forces of the countries to use each other’s bases.</li>\n<li>The ACSA will give Japan the ability to block the Strait of Malacca.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe ACSA is a bilateral agreement between India and Japan. It will enable the countries to avail logistical support from the other in the defence sector. Their armed forces can make use of the other’s bases in times of conflict. Eg: Japan will be able to avail the benefits of the Andaman and Nicobar base.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nOne of the key benefits of the agreement to Japan is that it would gain strategic access to the Strait of Malacca. This is the major route through which China gets its oil imports. This would serve as a tool for Japan in case conflict arises with China."
