  "question": "Two pipes A and B can fill a tank in 20 minutes and 30 minutes respectively. If both pipes are opened together, the time taken to fill the tank is:",
  "option1": "15 minutes",
  "option2": "25 minutes",
  "option3": "50 minutes",
  "option4": "12 minutes",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "12 minutes",
  "explanation": "Part of the tank filled by both pipes in one minute = $latex \\\\frac{1}{20}+\\\\frac{1}{30}&s=1$\r\nRequired time = $latex \\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{1}{20}+\\\\frac{1}{30}}=\\\\frac{20\\\\times 30}{50}=\\\\frac{60}{5}&s=2$ \r\nâˆ´ Required time = 12 Minutes \r\nHence option [D] is the right answer."
