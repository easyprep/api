  "question": "Which of the following is the mirror formula?",
  "option1": "v + u =f",
  "option2": "1/v + 1/u = 1/f",

  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1/v + 1/u = 1/f",
  "explanation": "Mirror formula represents image distance (v), object distance (u) and focal length (f) of the mirror. The mirror formula is 1/v + 1/u = 1/f. In case of lens it is 1/v - 1/u = 1/f."
