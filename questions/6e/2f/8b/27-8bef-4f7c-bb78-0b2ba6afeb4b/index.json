  "question": "The National Green Tribunal pulled up stone crushing units in the Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary in October. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The sanctuary is located in Madhya Pradesh.</li>\n<li>The forest department undertook clearing of trees in this sanctuary.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary is located in Solanpur of Maharashtra. This is in the Kathiwar-Gir dry deciduous forest ecosystem region. The sanctuary was set up in 1979. It is also known as the Jawaharlal Nehru Bustard Sanctuary. The Great Indian Bustard is a bird of the dry plains.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Great Indian Bustard birds are mostly sighted in grassland areas. It was recommended that the sanctuary be maintained with less tree cover and thinned out grass patches. This is the favourable condition for these large birds. Hence the forest department had cleared out trees from about 25 hectares of land."
