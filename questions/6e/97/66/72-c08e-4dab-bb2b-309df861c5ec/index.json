  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "Many animals go under the ground during winter. This process is called hibernation. During this period metabolic rate is reduced. In fact, it is a mechanism of survival. Amphibians like toad and frog undergo hibernation. Hybernation is also seen in female polar bears. Aestivation is an opposite process of hibernation. Some animals go under the ground during the dry season of summer. In zoology it is a state of inactivity and reduced metabolic activity that occurs during the dry season in species such as lungfish and snails."
