  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Kindly note that Ideas cannot be protected under any law pertaining to intellectual property rights (IPR). Copyrights protect expression of an idea, while Patents protect inventions. Itâ€™s worth note that the industries such as cinema, music, photography etc. have strong unions safeguarding the creative rights but still ideas are not protected under IPR anywhere. Thus, only embodiment of an idea in a tangible form can be protected."
