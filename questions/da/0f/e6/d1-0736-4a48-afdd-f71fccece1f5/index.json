  "explanation": "Rao Tularam (1825-63) was one of the most important leaders of the Great Indian Mutiny of 1857. He is credited with temporarily driving all of the British rule from Rewari (Haryana) and also helping rebel forces fighting in Delhi with men, money and material. After the 1857 uprising ended, he left India, met rulers of Iran and Afghanistan and also established contacts with the Tsar of Russia, to seek their help to fight a war to free India from the British. His plans were cut short by his death from dysentery in Kabul in 1863."
