  "option1": "Liver",
  "option2": "Blood",
  "option3": "Skin",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Bones",
  "explanation": "Strontium-90 is a &#8220;bone seeker&#8221; that exhibits biochemical behaviour similar to calcium, the next lighter Group 2 element. After entering the organism, most often by ingestion with contaminated food or water, about 70â€“80% of the dose gets excreted. Virtually all remaining strontium-90 is deposited in bones and bone marrow, with the remaining 1% remaining in blood and soft tissues. Its presence in bones can cause bone cancer, cancer of nearby tissues, and leukaemia. (wikipedia)"
