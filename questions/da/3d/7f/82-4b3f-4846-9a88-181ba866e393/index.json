  "question": "Consider the following statements with respect to Project &lsquo;Mausam&rsquo; by Government of India: <ol> <li>The project has been launched by Ministry of Culture.</li> <li>It aims to rekindle the long-lost ties across nations of the Pacific Ocean world.</li> </ol> Which of the above statement is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 and 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "Second statement is wrong because the project aims to develop lost links and cultural relations with countries of Indian Ocean littoral and not Pacific Ocean.<br> The central themes that hold Project &lsquo;Mausam&rsquo; together are those of cultural routes and maritime landscapes that not only linked different parts of the Indian Ocean littoral, but also connected the coastal centres to their hinterlands.More importantly, shared knowledge systems and ideas spread along these routes and impacted both coastal centres, and also large parts of the environs."
