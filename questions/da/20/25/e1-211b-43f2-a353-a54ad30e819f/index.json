  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "From the perspective of balance of payments — a country’s external sector balance sheet — foreign currency inflows are broadly divided into current account and capital account flows. While current account flows arise out of transactions in goods and services and are permanent in nature, capital account flows are essential in various kinds of loans and equity investments, which can be reversed. That is why policy makers have to keep a close eye on capital flows. <br> The Capital flows would include inflows through foreign borrowings by Indian corporate and businesses, NRI deposits and portfolio flows from institutional investors into the stock markets Loans to government and short-term trade credit are also included. India had controls on both capital account transactions as well as on the current account with the local currency fixed by the central bank. However, since 1991, when structural changes to the Indian economy were carried out, the rupee was first made convertible on the current account. Subsequently, capital controls were eased. In 1994, a big shift took place with the government allowing foreign portfolio investments. Over a period of time, foreign direct investment norms and overseas borrowing norms were eased."
