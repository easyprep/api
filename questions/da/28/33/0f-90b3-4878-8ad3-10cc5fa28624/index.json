  "question": "Consider the following pollutants: <ol> <li>Nitrogen Oxides (NOx&#039;s)</li> <li>Sulfur dioxide (SO2) </li> <li>Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)</li> <li>Nitrous oxide (N2O)</li> </ol> Which of the above is/are responsible for Acid rain?<br>",
  "option1": "2 and 4 Only",
  "option2": "1 and 2 Only",
  "option3": "1,2 and 4",
  "option4": "1,2,3 and 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 2 Only",
  "explanation": "Acid rain is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids.When humans burn fossil fuels, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) (Combination of NO and NO<sub>2)</sub> are released into the atmosphere.These chemical gases react with water, oxygen, and other substances to form mild solutions of sulfuric and nitric acid.Also, NOx&#039;s are also formed in atmosphere due to lightning strikes in tropics and subtropics level at a height of 3-5 km from earth surface whereas NOx&#039;s are also released by aircrafts in stratosphere.NOx&#039;s also helps in Ozone formation.<br>  <br>"
