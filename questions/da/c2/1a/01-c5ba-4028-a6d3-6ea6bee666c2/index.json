This is an   increase of 10% over the amount contributed by the country in the 5th cycle. India was the first implementing country to host a replenishment milestone of the Global Fund and now has become the first among G20, BRICS and implementer countries to announce the pledge for the 6th Replenishment. India has had a sustained partnership with the Global Fund since 2002 both as a recipient and as a donor. The Global Fund is a partnership designed to accelerate the end of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.  The GFTAM is an international financing and partnership organization that aims to attract, leverage and invest additional resources to end the epidemics of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria to support attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) established by the United Nations. Its headquarters is located in Geneva, Switzerland."
