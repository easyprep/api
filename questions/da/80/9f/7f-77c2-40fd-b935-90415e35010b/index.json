  "explanation": "During the Civil War following the Russian Revolution in 1917, Georgia briefly became part of the Transcaucasian Federation and then emerged as an independent republic before the Russian army invasion in 1921, which established a government of workers' and peasants' soviets. Soviet Georgia was incorporated into a new Transcaucasian Federation and became a founding republic of the Soviet Union in 1922. By the 1980s, an independence movement was established and grew, leading to Georgia's secession from the Soviet Union (present-day Russia) in April 1991."
