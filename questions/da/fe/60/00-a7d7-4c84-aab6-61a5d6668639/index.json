  "question": "With reference to the AEOI system implemented between India and Switzerland to curb tax evasion and avoidance, consider the following statements about these issues:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Tax avoidance is the use of illegal means to reduce the amount of tax owed to the state.</li>\n<li>Tax evasion is a criminal offence in India.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nTax avoidance is the use of legal means to reduce the amount of tax owed by an individual. Tax evasion is the use of illegal means to do the same. The Income tax act uses the GAAR rules (general anti-avoidance rules) to curb tax avoidance without any commercial purpose.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nTax evasion is a criminal offence under the Income Tax Act, 1961. Tax evasion occurs by means like under-reporting the income, which counts as concealing income to evade tax. This invites penalty ranging from 100% to 300% of evaded tax.\n&nbsp;"
