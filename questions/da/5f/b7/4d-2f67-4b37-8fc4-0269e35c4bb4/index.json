  "question": "Consider the following statements about Neem Coated Urea: <ol><li>Neem Coated Urea prevents leeching of nitrogen of urea</li><li>Government of India has made it mandatory for domestic fertiliser firms to &ldquo;neem coat&rdquo; at least 75 per cent of their urea production</li></ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Both are correct statements<br> The excessive use of urea has deteriorated the soil health and adversely impacting overall crop yield. Neem coated urea prevents leeching of nitrogen of urea into the soil and hence prevents the soil from damaging. The government hence decided to make it mandatory for all the indigenous producers of urea to produce 75 per cent of their total production of subsidised urea as Neem Coated urea."
