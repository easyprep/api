  "answer": "Bengal",
  "explanation": "Pabna Movement or Peasant Unrest in East Bengal (1872-76): In East Bengal, the peasantry was oppressed by zamindars through ejection, harassment, illegal seizure of propertyed, arbitrarily enhancement of rent and use of force. Therefore, the peasants organised no-rent unions and launched armed attacks on the Zamindars and their agents. The Pabna district was the storm-centre of this movement and thus, the movement is known as the Pabna movement. The movement was suppressed only after armed intervention by the British."
