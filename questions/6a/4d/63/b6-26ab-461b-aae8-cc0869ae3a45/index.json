  "option1": "France",
  "option2": "Netherlands",
  "option3": "Germany",
  "option4": "Belgium",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Germany",
  "explanation": "Germany's UNESCO World Heritage Site is \"Abbey and Altenmunster of Lorsch\". The town of Lorsch in Hesse, Germany, hosts the renowned “Konigshalle”. Apart from the Gothic gables and a few relics of past repairs and completion, this gatehouse is one of the very rare buildings from the Carolingian era whose original appearance is intact. It is a reminder of the past grandeur of an abbey founded around 764. The monastery’s zenith was probably in 876 when, at the death of Louis II the German, it became the burial place for the Carolingian kings of the Eastern part of the Frankish Realm."
