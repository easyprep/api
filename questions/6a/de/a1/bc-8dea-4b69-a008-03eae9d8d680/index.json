Mr. Goel, a recipient of the Police Medals for Gallantry and Meritorious Service, joined the RAW in 2001. The Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) is the foreign intelligence agency of India. It was established in 1968 following the intelligence failures of the Sino-Indian War, which persuaded the Government of India (GoI) to create a specialised, independent agency dedicated to foreign intelligence gathering. The head of RAW is designated Secretary (R) in the Cabinet Secretariat, and is under the direct command of the Prime Minister, and reports on an administrative basis to the Cabinet Secretary of India, who reports to the Prime Minister. It is headquartered in New Delhi."
