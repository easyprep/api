  "option1": "500 Rs.",
  "option2": "600 Rs.",
  "option3": "700 Rs.",
  "option4": "710 Rs.",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "600 Rs.",
  "explanation": "Principal + SI for 2 years = 720 Rs. ……(I)\r\nPrincipal + SI for 7 years = 1020 Rs. ……(II)\r\nSubtracting equation (I) from (II), \r\nS.I. for 5 years = (1020 - 720) = 300 Rs.\r\n∴ S.I. for 2 years $latex = 300\\\\times \\\\frac{2}{5} = 120 Rs.&s=1$\r\n∴ Principal = (720 - 120) = 600 Rs.\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer."
