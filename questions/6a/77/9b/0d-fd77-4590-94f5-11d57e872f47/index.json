It is considered the highest honour in the British art world.<br />All four artists shortlisted for the 2019 Turner prize have been named winners after they came together and made a plea for judges to recognize the causes of “commonality, multiplicity and solidarity”. At a ceremony in Margate, Turner prize history was made when Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Oscar Murillo and Tai Shani were named the collective winner after they jointly wrote to judges."
