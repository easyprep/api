  "question": "Consider the following observations with respect to the Harappan settlements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The majority of Harappan settlements were located near water sources</li>\r\n<li>Harappans made sinking wells and building reservoirs, where local surface water supplies were inadequate</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "<p class=\\\"Notes\\\">Access to water is an important consideration in settlement sites the world over. The majority of Harappan settlements were located near water sources such as streams and aquifers, but the Harappans were competent hydraulic engineers, sinking wells (as at Mohenjo-daro) and building reservoirs (as at Dholavira) where local surface water supplies were inadequate. They dealt with the problems of river flooding, annually variable in its location and force and a potential deterrent to settlement in some areas, by constructing many settlements with massive flood defences in the form of platforms and walls."
