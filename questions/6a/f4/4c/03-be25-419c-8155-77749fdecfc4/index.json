  "question": "A man crosses a road 250 meters wide in 75 seconds. His speed in km/hr is:",
  "option1": 12.5,
  "option2": 15,
  "option3": 10,
  "option4": 12,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 12,
  "explanation": "$latex Speed = \\\\frac{Distance }{Time}=\\\\frac{250}{75}&s=1$\r\n$latex =\\\\frac{10}{3}m/s=\\\\frac{10}{3}\\\\times \\\\frac{18}{5}km/hr&s=1$\r\n$latex =2\\\\times 6 km/hr= 12 km/hr$\r\nHence option [D] is the right answer."
