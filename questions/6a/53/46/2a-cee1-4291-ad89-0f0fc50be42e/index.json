  "explanation": "Haiti is the present country that was the French colony on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola from 1659 to 1804 \"Saint-Domingue\". The name was also used, at times, for the island of Hispaniola as a whole, all of it, nominally, being at times a French colony. The Spanish form of the name, Santo Domingo, also was used at times for the island as a whole. The border between French-speaking Haiti and the Spanish-speaking Dominican Republic was not established until after the Dominican Republic's declaration of independence in 1844.",
