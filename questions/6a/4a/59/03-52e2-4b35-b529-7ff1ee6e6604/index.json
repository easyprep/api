  "question": "Ice cubes are floating in a glass of water. What will happen to the water level when the ice cubes melt?",
  "option1": "Will first increase and then start decreasing",
  "option2": "Will first decrease and then start increasing",
  "option3": "Will remain unchanged",
  "option4": "Will increase",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Will remain unchanged",
  "explanation": "The water level remains the same when the ice cube melts. A floating object displaces an amount of water equal to its own weight. Since water expands when it freezes, one ounce of frozen water has a larger volume than one ounce of liquid water."
