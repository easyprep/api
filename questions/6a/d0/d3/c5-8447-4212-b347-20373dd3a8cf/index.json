  "option1": "Jharkhand",
  "option2": "Odisha",
  "option3": "Punjab",
  "option4": "MP",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Odisha",
  "explanation": "The Odisha government has decided to provide monthly financial assistance of Rs 10,000 to Padma award winners of the state belonging to Economically Weaker Section (EWS). The move has come days after media reports highlighted the plight of several Padma Shri winners from the state and how they are forced to do odd jobs like grazing goats for survival. A total of 84 persons from the state have so far been honoured with Padma Sri award of whom 45 have passed away. Of the remaining 39 persons, financial condition of some is precarious. Recently, 75-year-old tribal farmer Daitari Nayak of Talabaitarani village, who was awarded the 2019 Padma Shri for digging a 3-km long canal through a mountain in Odisha, had openly announced to return the award as he was not given work by the villagers after getting the award."
