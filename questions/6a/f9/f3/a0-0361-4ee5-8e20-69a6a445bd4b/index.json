  "question": "After rat hole mining of coal in Meghalaya, the stateâ€™s illegal stone mining has come into light. In that context, consider the following:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Meghalaya is exempt from the provisions of Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act (MMDR), 1957 as it is a Sixth Schedule State.</li>\n<li>Stone is a minor mineral.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nMeghalaya is a VI schedule state according to constitution. This listing provides the tribes with ownership of the land and its constituent minerals. However, the Supreme Court ruled that the state may enjoy this privilege subject to compliance with the MMRD Act, 1957.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe MMDR Act recognises stone as a minor mineral. This category also includes mining of sand. The Meghalaya Minor Mineral Concession Rules regulates the grant of leases and permits with respect to minor mineral mining in the state. The stone mining has been highlighted at the National Green Tribunal due to its proximity to reserve forest areas."
