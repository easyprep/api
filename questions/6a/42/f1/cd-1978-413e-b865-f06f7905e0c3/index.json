  "question": "With regards to recent discussions about hypersonic missiles being developed by Russia, consider the following statements about the Mach number system:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Mach number is the ratio of a body’s speed and it’s mass.</li>\r\n<li>Supersonic missiles are faster than hypersonic missiles.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nMach number is the ratio of a body’s speed to the speed of sound in an undisturbed medium. The system is named after physicist Ernst Mach and is used to represent the speed of an object in relation to the speed of sound. Higher the Mach number, faster is the object.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nA hypersonic missile flies at a faster speed than a supersonic missile. Supersonic bodies move at speeds ranging from over Mach 1 to less than Mach 3 while the hypersonic objects move at speeds above Mach 5, meaning 5 times the speed of sound."
