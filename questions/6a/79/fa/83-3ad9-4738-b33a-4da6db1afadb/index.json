  "question": "Justice Ranjan Gogoi, who is expected to become 46th Chief Justice of India (CJI), hails from which North-East State of India?",
  "option1": "Assam",
  "option2": "Arunachal Pradesh",
  "option3": "Tripura",
  "option4": "Nagaland",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Assam",
  "explanation": "Justice Ranjan Gogoi, the son of former Assam chief minister Keshab Chandra Gogoi, will become the 46th Chief Justice of India (CJI), after the current CJI Dipak Misra retires on October 2. He will have tenure of 13 months â€“ till November 17, 2019. As per convention, the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court has to be appointed as the next CJI. Therefore, once the recommendation by CJI Misra is approved, Justice Gogoi  will become the first CJI from North-Eastern states. His appointment is crucial as it comes at a time when Assam is preparing to release a final National Register of Citizens (NRC), possibly by the end of the year 2018. Justice Gogoi was one of the four senior-most judges of the court who had called an unprecedented press conference this January, when they had publicly raised concerns about the administration of the court and the formation of benches for the allocation of important cases. He is also one of 11 judges in the Supreme Court who have disclosed their assets."
