  "explanation": "Blue vitriol is blue, crystalline hydrous solution of copper sulphate, CuSO4•5H2O, one of the most important industrial copper salts, used in insecticides, germicides, and hair dyes and in the processing of leather and textiles.<br />Magnesium sulphate is a chemical compound containing magnesium, sulphur and oxygen, with the formula MgSO4. It is often encountered as the heptahydrate epsomite (MgSO4•7H2O), commonly called \\\"Epsom salt\\\". <br />Sodium bicarbonate or sodium hydrogen carbonate is the chemical compound with the formula NaHCO3. The salt has many related names such as baking soda, bread soda, cooking soda, bicarbonate of soda. <br />Caustic soda or sodium hydroxide is an essential ingredient in an array of industrial applications. In addition, consumers use caustic soda when using cleaners, such as oven and drain cleaners."
