  "question": "The Plates of Lithosphere are moved by which of the following?",
  "option1": "Gravitational force",
  "option2": "Conduction currents",
  "option3": "Electromagnetic currents",
  "option4": "Convection currents",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Convection currents",
  "explanation": "The plates of the Lithosphere are moved by the underlying hot mantle convection cells. The plates of lithosphere float on the top of the asthenosphere. Convection currents rise in the asthenosphere and lead to the plate movements."
