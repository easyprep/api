The state government appoints DGP after consulting with the Union Public Service Commission. The state government chooses the DGP from among the 3 officers empanelled by the UPSC.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Supreme Court had rejected the practice of using acting or temporary DGPs by the states.
