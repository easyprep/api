  "answer": "Black Skin, White Masks",
  "explanation": "The idea of blackness was analyzed by Fanon in his book ‘Black Skin, White Masks in which Fanon argued that colonialism has dehumanized the natives. According to him, the process of dehumanization was thorough. And that the black man can see himself only as a black (mirror) image o the white man. The White man is the master and represents an object that must be feared and desired. The black therefore tries to be more like the (desirable) white master by putting on a ‘white mask’."
