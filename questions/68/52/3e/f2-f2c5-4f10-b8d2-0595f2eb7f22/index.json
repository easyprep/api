  "question": "Which of the following statements are correct with respect to PTR/ Pupil Teacher ratio:\n<ol>\n<li>The PTR norms for the country are 30:1 for primary level education, 35:1 for upper primary level education and 30:1 for secondary level education.</li>\n<li>The PTR compliance is aided by Sarva Siksha Abhiyan program for elementary and secondary education.</li>\n<li>Tripura, Sikkim and Nagaland have the worst PTR among Indian states.</li>\n<li>Kerala is the most compliant among the large states.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 2, 3  & 4",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 4",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 4",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe PTR norms are set down under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009. The Unified District Information on School Education (UDISE) published data about the PTR compliance of states and UTs. The differences in the optimum pupil strength per class varies across the world. This makes global PTR data not uniformly comparable. However, UNESCO has said that the Indian standards are comparable to other nations of similar socio-economic standing.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nPTR implementation among the schools is in the state and UT government’s jurisdiction. But their effort is aided by Centre’s flagship programs for improving education coverage. The Sarva Siksha Abhiyan is concerned with universal elementary education. But the secondary education is dealt with by the Rashtriya Madhyamik Siksha Abhiyan. These two schemes provide additional teachers in order to reach the optimal PTR levels.\n<strong>Statement 3</strong> is incorrect:\nAccording to the UDISE report of 2017-18, the smaller states are the best performing with respect to PTR levels. Tripura, Sikkim and Nagaland are the top performing states. UTs also showed good performance. The worst performing states were the larger states, especially, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The percentage of schools that are non-compliant with national standards is also very high in these states. E.g.: about 67% and 77% of primary and upper primary schools of Bihar are non-compliant to norms.\n<strong>Statement 4</strong> is correct:\nThe UDISE report shows that Kerala is the most compliant to PTR norms among the larger states. It has very low compliance issue- less than 5% of primary and upper primary schools are non-compliant. It also has the best compliance to the provisions of RTE. Kerala has historically been a high spender in the education field. Some of its initiatives, like State Literacy Mission, are keenly involved in improving the state’s educational standing."
