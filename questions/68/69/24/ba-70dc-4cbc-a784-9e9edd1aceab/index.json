  "option1": "Kerala",
  "option2": "Meghalaya",
  "option3": "Karnataka",
  "option4": "Sikkim",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Kerala",
  "explanation": "Cerbera odollam, commonly known as the Suicide tree, Pong-pong, and Othalanga. It is a species of tree native to India and other parts of southern Asia. It grows wild along the coast in many parts of Kerala. It yields a potent poison, often used for suicide or murder. The kernels of C. Odollam contain cerberin, a potent cardenolide glycoside belonging to the cardiac glycoside family of toxins that includes digoxin. The poison blocks the calcium ion channels in heart muscle, causing disruption of the heart beat. This is most often fatal. Cerberin is difficult to detect in autopsies and its taste can be masked with strong spices. Therefore it is often used in homicide and suicide in India."
