The Golden Square or Four Colonels was a faction of pro-Fascist army officers of the Iraqi armed forces who played a part in Iraqi politics throughout the 1930s and early 1940s. The activities of the Golden Square culminated in supporting Rashid Ali al-Gaylani in his overthrow of the government in 1941, briefly instituting the Golden Square 'National Defense Government'. They conspired to overthrow the Hashemite monarchy in Iraq and expel British forces. The British intervened and three of the plotters, and many of their supporters, were put to death.",
