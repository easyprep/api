  "option5": "",
  "answer": "3 only",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Consumer protection bill, 2019 seeks to replace the Consumer Protection Act/ COPRA of 1986. It looks to establish a Central Consumer Protection Authority. The CCPA will have multiple roles like conducting investigations into rights violation, issuing order for recall of hazardous products and misleading advertisements, imposing penalties etc. The National Consumer Protection Commission exists under the 1986 act’s provision. It is a dispute redressal agency.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nA person who buys a good or service is defined as a consumer. This does not include those who buy the same for commercial resale or for other commercial purposes. This transaction can have taken place through means, both online and offline- teleshopping, direct selling, multi-level marketing, electronic sales, etc.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nMisleading advertisements can be punished under the bill when enacted. It provides deterrent punishments for such advertisements and the CCPA can order the manufacturer/ trader concerned to withdraw the same. It can also impose a fine of upto 10 lakh INR and even a prison sentence of upto 2 years for false advertisements.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is incorrect:\nCelebrities who endorse misleading advertisements are not exempt from punitive actions. They are also subject to penalties of upto 10 lakh INR fine and imprisonment term of upto 2 years. Repeated offence can invite a higher fine of 50 lakh INR and a longer incarceration term of 5 years. The CCPA can prevent a celebrity (or any endorser) from endorsing the product for a year and may extend the prohibition period to 3 years for repeated offence. They are however not liable for certain cases."
