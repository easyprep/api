  "question": "Which international organisation has launched 'The State of the Global Climate' report?",
  "option1": "UNEP",
  "option2": "IUCN",
  "option3": "IPCC",
  "option4": "WMO",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "WMO",
  "explanation": "\\'The State of the Global Climate\\' report has recently launched by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The report presented a grim picture of the accelerating physical signs and socio-economic impacts of the climate change across the world as record greenhouse gas concentrations drive global temperatures towards increasingly dangerous levels. UN Chief Antonio Guterres has asked world leaders to come with concrete, realistic plans  to boost climate action as greenhouse gas concentrations are driving global temperatures towards increasingly dangerous levels impacting millions of people. The report notes that 2018 was the fourth warmest year on record and 2015–2018 were the four warmest years on record as the long-term warming trend continues. Ocean heat content is also at a record high and global mean sea level continues to rise, while Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice extent is well below average. Average global temperature reached approximately 1°C above pre-industrial levels and nations are not on track to meet climate change targets and rein in temperature increases."
