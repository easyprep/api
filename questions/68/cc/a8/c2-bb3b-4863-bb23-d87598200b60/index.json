  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe G77 has 134 countries. The coalition was formed in 1964, in Geneva, Switzerland. Its objective is to promote economic interest of the members. It also seeks to increase the members’ negotiating capacity at the United Nations. It was constituted by the ‘Joint Declaration of Seventy Seven Countries’.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nIndia is one of members of the G77. It held the chair in 1970 to 1971 and again in 1979 to 1980. Though the G77 initially had only 77 members, most of the UN member nations are now part of it. China however, doesn’t consider itself to be a member and issues statements in the name of Group of 77 and China."
