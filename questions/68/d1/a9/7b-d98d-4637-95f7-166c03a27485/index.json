  "option1": "1, 2 & 3 Only",
  "option2": "2 & 4 Only",
  "option3": "2, 3 & 4 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "The GHI is calculated by taking into account four key parameters: shares of undernourished population, wasted and stunted children aged fewer than 5, and infant mortality rate of the same age group. The 2016 GHI report states that an estimated 15% population in India is undernourished-lacking in adequate food intake, both in quantity and quality. The share of under-5 children who are &ldquo;wasted&rdquo; is about 15% while the share of children who are &ldquo;stunted&rdquo; is a staggering 39% and the under-5 mortality rate is 4.8% in India."
