  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Fractional Distillation",
  "explanation": "Fractional Distillation is based on the fact that the different components of oil have different boiling points. In this process, oil is heated in a furnace to 400 degree Celsius(752 F) and it vapourises. The vapours are introduced into a tall fractionating column."
