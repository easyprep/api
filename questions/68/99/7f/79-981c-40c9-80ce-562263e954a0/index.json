  "option1": "United Kingdom",
  "option2": "France",
  "option3": "Spain",
  "option4": "Portugal",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "France",
  "explanation": "Haiti gained independence in 1804 from France. In 1697 France and Spain settled their hostilities on the Hispaniola Island by way of the Treaty of Ryswick of 1697, which divided Hispaniola between them. France received the western third and subsequently named it Saint-Domingue, the French equivalent of Santo Domingo, the Spanish colony on Hispaniola. The French set about creating sugar and coffee plantations, worked by vast numbers of slaves imported from Africa, and Saint-Domingue grew to become their richest colonial possession. Inspired by the French Revolution of 1789 and principles of the rights of man, the French settlers and free people of colour pressed for greater political freedom and more civil rights. The slaves, along with free gens de couleur and allies, continued their fight for independence, led by generals Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Alexandre Petion and Henry Christophe. The rebels finally managed to decisively defeat the French troops at the Battle of Verti√®res on 18 November 1804, leading the first-ever nation to successfully gain independence through a slave revolt.",
