  "answer": "United Nations",
  "explanation": "Following the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus through Operation Atilla, the island of Cyprus was de facto partitioned into two- the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus in the south and the self-declared unofficial de facto state in northern Cyprus named Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. And, a buffer zone was established in between to de-escalate tensions between the two parties. This zone is known as the Green Line, also known as the Atilla Line, which constitutes 4% of the total island, administered and controlled by the United Nations. The Republic of Cyprus, the European Union and the international community is of the view that the northern part of the island of Cyprus, which the Republic of Cyprus has de jure sovereignty, is illegally occupied by the Turkish forces and the establishment of the self-declared unofficial Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is illegal and void and is not recognised by the international community except Turkey."
