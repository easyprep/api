  "question": "By what phase angle the velocity is ahead of displacement in S.H.M?",
  "option1": "π",
  "option2": "π/4",
  "option3": "π/2",
  "option4": "2π",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "π/2",
  "explanation": "In S.H.M. the velocity is ahead of displacement by a phase angle π/ 2, the acceleration is ahead of velocity by a phase angle π/ 2 and the acceleration is ahead of displacement by a phase angle of π."
