  "option1": "A genus of brown macroalgae distributed throughout the temperate and tropical oceans of the world.",
  "option2": "A narrow passage of water connecting two seas or two other large areas of water.",
  "option3": "An area of unfrozen-open sea water surrounded by sea ice/ pack ice.",
  "option4": "A ring-shaped coral reef including a coral rim that encircles a lagoon partially or completely.",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "An area of unfrozen-open sea water surrounded by sea ice/ pack ice.",
  "explanation": "Polynya is an area of unfrozen-open seawater surrounded by sea ice/pack ice. Polynyas are areas of persistent open water with sea ice, for most of the times, they tend to be roughly oval or circular in shape, but they can be irregularly shaped too. Polynyas are generally believed to be of two types. Coastal Polynyas characteristically lies just beyond landfast ice i.e, ice that is anchored to the coast and stays in place throughout the winter. They are thought to be caused chiefly by persistent local off-shore winds, such as foehn or katabatic, winds typically found off the coasts of Greenland and Antarctica, for example, North Water Polynya. Open Ocean Polynya, the larger and longer-lasting of the two types, form within the ice cover and are behind to be caused by the upwelling of deep warmer water. For example- Weddel Polynya in the Antarctic Weddel Sea."
