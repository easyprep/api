  "explanation": "Decree 900, also known as the Agrarian Reform Law, was a Guatemalan land-reform law passed on June 17, 1952, during the Guatemalan Revolution. The law was introduced by President Jacobo Arbenz Guzman and passed by the Guatemalan Congress. It redistributed unused land greater than 224 acres in area to local peasants, compensating landowners with government bonds. The goal of the legislation was to move Guatemala's economy from pseudo-feudalism into capitalism. Although in force for only eighteen months, the law had a major effect on the Guatemalan land-reform movement.",
