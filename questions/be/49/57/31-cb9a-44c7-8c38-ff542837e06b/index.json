  "answer": "Cricket",
  "explanation": "The General Assembly of Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) has decided to include cricket in the sports programme in the 2022 edition of the Asian Games, which is scheduled to be held in Hangzhou, China. The last time cricket featured in the Asian Games was in the 2010 and 2014 edition but Team India opted out of the event on both the occasions citing hectic schedule.  The 2010 and 2014 editions saw cricket being played in the twenty-20 format and that is likely to continue during the 2022 Asian Games in China."
