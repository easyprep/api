  "question": "With the impending launch of the 2018 Tiger census’ results, consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>The census was taken in the 18 major tiger states of the country.</li>\n<li>The 2018 census made use of MSTrIPES app.</li>\n<li>2018 census involved the participation of Nepal and Bangladesh while the earlier census saw the additional participation by Bhutan.</li>\n<li>Madhya Pradesh has the largest number of tiger deaths due to poaching.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "1, 2 and 3",
  "option3": "2 and 4",
  "option4": "1 and 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 and 4",
  "explanation": "<strong> Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe census 2018 expanded the area under survey to include states from the North-east like Nagaland and Manipur, and also Gujarat. This inclusion is expected to show an increased population number. The census also increased its scope in the animals surveyed- eg: it studied population of leopards, apart from the tigers, during the 2014 census.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nMSTrIPES app was released in 2010 by the government. It stands for Monitoring System for Tigers- Intensive Protection and Ecological Status. It will enable more accurate and efficient data collection by the survey teams. It will record the routes taken by the team and also upload and store geo-tagged photographs in the database. Individual tigers would be recognised by software based identification of individual stripe patterns.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe 2014 census involved only Nepal and Bangladesh. In the 2018 census, the activity saw the participation of 3 neighbouring countries for the first time- Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan. The countries coordinated to track the cross border movement of tiger population. This will produce the Indian subcontinent’s (home to 80-90% of tigers in the world) first joint tiger estimation report.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is correct:\nMadhya Pradesh has the largest number of poaching deaths of tigers in India. In 2012, the state had decided to set up an STPF/ special tiger protection force, but the battalion is yet to be constituted. Before 2006, the state had the highest tiger population in the country. It has lost its position over the years to Karnataka and Uttarakhand. Officials have blamed it on the patchy forest cover, encroachment by large land owners and electric fencing used by farmers.\n&nbsp;"
