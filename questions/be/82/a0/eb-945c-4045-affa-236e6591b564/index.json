  "answer": "Siddhu and Kanhu",
  "explanation": "Santhal Rebellion (1855-56): This tribal movement was led by Siddhu and Kanhu in the Rajmahal Hills, Bihar, who opposed the  British land revenue policy. The major causes of revolt were oppression of police, atrocities of landlords and moneylenders,  ill-treatment of small farmers by land revenue officials and ban on shifting cultivation in forest areas. The British government pacified these Santhals by creating a separate district of Santhal Parganas."
