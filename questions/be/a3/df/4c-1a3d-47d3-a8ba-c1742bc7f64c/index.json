  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nLocusts are polyphagous feeders. This means that they feed on multiple varieties of plant crops. They feed on the growing tips, flowers, leaves, fruits, bark, etc. of the plants. A small swarm of desert locusts, which are the most important pest among the locust species, is able to eat as much food as 2,500 people in a day.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nLocust attacks are most common in the period before the monsoon in India. The locust swarms usually originate from Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Apart from the globally important Desert Locusts, other species like Tree Locusts, Migratory Locusts and Bombay Locusts are also found in India."
