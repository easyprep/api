  "question": "In context with the recent plans to set up centres to conserve the Indian Vulture, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is a critically vulnerable species.</li>\n<li>The population declined due to diclofenac poisoning.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Indian Vulture or the Gyps indicus is listed as a critically endangered species by IUCN. It is a scavenging bird that is found in India, Pakistan and Nepal. It is found in cliff- dominated landscapes but may also make use of trees and human made structures.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Indian Vulture population suffered a massive decline due to diclofenac poisoning. The anti-inflammatory drug was used for cattle which later ended up in the Vulturesâ€™ systems. This caused renal failure among the birds. The use of diclofenac for veterinary purposes is now banned in India."
