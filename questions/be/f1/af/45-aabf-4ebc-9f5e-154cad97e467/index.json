  "option1": "Agni",
  "option2": "Varuna",
  "option3": "Indra",
  "option4": "Soma",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Soma",
  "explanation": "Soma & Haoma : (It is the 9th Mandal of Rigveda which contains 114 hymns ) The fermented juice of the plant called Soma appears to have been the only intoxicating drink used in Vedic times. So much were the ancient Aryans addicted to this drink, that Soma was soon worshipped as a deity both in India and in Iran (under the name Haoma in the latter country), and we find one entire Mandala, or Book, of the Rig-Veda, dedicated to this deity."
