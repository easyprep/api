  "option1": "UK",
  "option2": "United States",
  "option3": "Canada",
  "option4": "Russia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "United States",
  "explanation": "The United States is subject to more than 30 national emergencies. They can declared for various reasons. The National Emergencies Act (NEA) 1976 was enacted to formalize the emergencies powers of the President. The Act empowers the President to activate special powers during a crisis but imposes certain procedural formalities when invoking such powers. The perceived need for the law arose from the scope and number of laws granting special powers to the executive in times of national emergency. Since 1976, presidents have declared at least 58 states of emergency. Most of them fall under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, which allow a president to impose economic sanctions."
