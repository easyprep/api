  "question": "Consider the following comparisons of the Himalayan Rivers and Peninsular rivers:<br> 1. Most of the Himalayan rivers are perennial, while most of the peninsular rivers are rainfed<br> 2. The gradient of the Himalayan rivers is steeper than peninsular rivers<br> 3. The peninsular rivers cause more erosion on their way in comparison to the Himalayan rivers<br> Which among the above is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The rivers of the Himalayan region rise in the glaciers and they are perennial. In summer their volume tends to increase because snow melt in the upper reaches. The peninsular rivers do not have their sources in glaciers and most of them are rainfed. The Himalayan rivers not only carry a larger volume of water in comparison to their peninsular counterparts but also carry a larger amount of silt. On the other hand the peninsular region rivers carry a very limited amount of sediment. The slopes of the Himalayan rivers is very steep on the upper reaches. That is one reason that they erode and transport huge amounts of sediments. Further, the landforms over these rivers flow is also young. On the other hand, the peninsular rivers have not very steep gradient and they flow on already eroded old topography. Further, the hard rocks of the peninsular region are not as susceptible to erosion as those of the Himalayan region."
