  "answer": "Eskimo",
  "explanation": "After the retreat of glaciers, a series of migrations took place from Asia to North America via Bering land bridge. These post-glacial movements resulted in the northwestern parts of the American continent being inhabited by peoples resembling those of northern belt of Asia, and they continued their way eastward wherever the environment was the same as that to which they had adapted themselves. These people living in the tundra region of America and Greenland are called the Eskimos."
