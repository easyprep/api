  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 only",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nLahore declaration, signed in 1999, is one of the landmark treaties between India and Pakistan. It is the second treaty to deal with nuclear aspect after the 1988 Non-Nuclear Aggression Agreement. It calls for responsible action by both governments when it comes to nuclear weapons use during times of conflict. It also called for confidence building measures and prevention of accidental and unauthorised use of nuclear weapons.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nShimla accord was signed in 1972, seeking to reverse the effects of the 1971 war. It called for peace and stability between the countries. It called for bilateral resolution of differences. Apart from this, diplomatic recognition of Bangladesh and a definite LoC were important outcomes.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Shimla Accord calls for removing third party intervention from issues between India and Pakistan. It called for peaceful bilateral resolutions. UNMOGIP, which was established by the Karachi Agreement is a third party observer. It lost significance after the 1972 accord."
