  "option1": "Only 1",

  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Commercial fishing activity is largely concentrated in the oceans of the Northern Hemisphere. The most favourable areas for growth of fish are the shallow waters of the oceans. The continental shelf areas of the oceans are the most important fish producing areas. These microscopic plant and associated animal organisms are together called plankton. Some of the commercially harvested fish such as herring and mackeral live directly on plankton while others such as tuna and shark prey on those eating plankton."
