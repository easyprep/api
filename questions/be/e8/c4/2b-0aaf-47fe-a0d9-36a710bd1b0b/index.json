  "question": "What is the India's rank in the 2017 EIU Global Democracy Index?",
  "option1": "42nd",
  "option2": "64th",
  "option3": "33rd",
  "option4": "21st",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "42nd",
  "explanation": "India has been ranked 42nd out of 165 countries at the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)\\'s annual Global Democracy Index due to rise of conservative religious ideologies and increase in vigilantism and violence against minorities as well as other dissenting voices. This year’s report which also measured the state of media freedom around the world noted that in India, media is ‘partially free’. Moreover, journalists are at risk from government, military and non-state actors and radical groups, and the threat of violence has a chilling effect on media coverage. The EIU is the research and analysis division of the UK-based media behemoth \\\"The Economist Group\\\". The list is topped by Norway, Iceland, Sweden, New Zealand and Denmark. The index ranks 165 independent states and two territories on the basis of five categories: electoral process and pluralism, civil liberties, the functioning of government, political participation and political culture."
