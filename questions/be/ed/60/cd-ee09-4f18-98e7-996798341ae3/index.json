  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct. The third battle of Panipat shattered the dream of Marathas to establish their supremacy in whole India. Second statement is not correct because the third battle of Panipat gave opportunity to East India Company to establish and consolidate their rule in Bihar and Bengal (not north-west India as mentioned in question) and to challenge Marathas and other Indian powers and finally to establish their rule in India. The third statement is also incorrect because attack of Nadir Shah pre-dates third battle of Panipat."
