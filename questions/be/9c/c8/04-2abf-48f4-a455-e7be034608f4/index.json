  "question": "What is the index of refraction for perfect vacuum?",
  "option1": 0,
  "option2": 1,
  "option3": 1.5,
  "option4": 0.5,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 0,
  "explanation": "Index of refraction for perfect vacuum is zero.\r\nLight can change speed and direction when it goes through different materials. All materials that transmit light have a property called index of refraction. \r\nThe index of refraction is 1 for a perfect vacuum, 1.0003 for air, 1.33 for water, about 1.5 for various kinds of glass, and 2.42 for diamond. \r\nLight travels more slowly through higher index-of-refraction materials than through lower ones."
