  "question": "Why the west flowing rivers of the peninsular India don’t make deltas?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Amount of silt carried by these rivers is very less</li>\r\n<li>Some rivers flow in rift valleys</li>\r\n<li>Tides don’t allow the rivers to create deltas</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "A large number of west flowing rivers in peninsular India flow into the Arabian Sea. The slope of the western Ghats is steep and that is the reason that these rivers have a rapid flow. Due to this, the rivers carry their silt into deep sea. At the same time, the Narmada and Tapti rivers flow via the rift valleys and while doing so the eroded material carried by them gets deposited in the fractures of the fault zones. Thus, they don&#8217;t form deltas. Morover, the tides are also one reason that the rivers of western side don&#8217;t form deltas."
