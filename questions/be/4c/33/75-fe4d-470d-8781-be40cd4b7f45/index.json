  "question": "Which state government has launched clouding seeding Project Varshadhari under which an aircraft will spray chemicals to induce rainfall?",
  "option1": "Karnataka",
  "option2": "Mizoram",
  "option3": "Punjab",
  "option4": "Kerala",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Karnataka",
  "explanation": "The Karnataka Government has recently launched an ambitious clouding seeding Project Varshadhari in Bengaluru to deal with poor monsoons in the state. Under the project, an aircraft will spray chemicals to induce rainfall. The purpose of the project is to condense small water particles by clouds (size less than 10 microns) to droplets of 50 microns, which can constitute rains. It is an experimental project that will cover Bengaluru, Gadag and Yadgir districts of the state. The Cloud seeding (also known as weather modification technique) is an artificial way to induce moisture in the clouds so as to cause a rainfall."
