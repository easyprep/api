  "answer": "US",
  "explanation": "United States and South Korea kicked off the annual military exercise 'Foal Eagle drill'. Nearly 11500 American and 290000 South Korean troops will be participating in a month-long a series of field training exercises to be held under 'Foal Eagle drill'. This edition of 'Foal Eagle drill' will be a low-key event, featuring fewer strategic weapons, as North Korea has proposed to hold summits with the South Korea and US, which has in turn eased the tension and diplomatic rhetoric on Korean peninsula. Earlier, the drill was to be held in February 2018. However, it was delayed in order to avoid a clash with Winter Olympic Games 2018 in Pyeongchang, South Korea.",
