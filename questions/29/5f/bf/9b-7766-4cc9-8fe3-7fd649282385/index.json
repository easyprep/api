Which of the following is / are correct statements with respect to the Gas Hydrates?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>They are source of Methane gas</li>\r\n<li>They are found abundantly in sea-beds in deep oceans and the permafrost regions</li>\r\n<li>They are one of most safely exploitable source of energy</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",

  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Gas hydrate is a solid ice-like form of water that mainly contains methane, which constitute a future source of natural gas. Methane gas hydrate is stable at the seafloor at water depths beneath about 500 m depth where temperature does not exceeds gas hydrate stability. Large quantities of gas hydrates exist on the world\\'s continental margins.  Third statement is not correct because commercial exploitation of <i>methane from gas hydrates is one of the major concerns. </i>"
