  "question": "Consider the following statements about the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine that was in news recently: <ol> <li>This vaccine has been recently introduced into the country's Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP)</li> <li>The vaccine helps to prevent Pertussis (whooping cough) among adults</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine is not a part of Universal Immunisation Programme. <u>Second statement is again incorrect</u> because this vaccine is used for preventing cervical cancer among women. The universal immunisation programme now consists of vaccination for 12 diseases- tuberculosis, diphtheria, Pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus, poliomyelitis, measles, Hepatitis B, Diarrhoea, Japanese Encephalitis, rubella, Pneumonia (Haemophilus Influenza Type B) and Pneumococcal diseases (Pneumococcal Pneumonia and Meningitis). Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine in is not a part of the programme. Recently, National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) recommended the HPV vaccine to be introduced as a part of Universal Immunisation Programme. But contrary to this, a wing of RSS wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting not to introduce Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine in the country."
