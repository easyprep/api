  "question": "The compound interest on 30000 Rs. at 7% per annum for a certain time is 4347 Rs. The time is :",
  "option1": "2 years",
  "option2": "2.5 years",
  "option3": "3 years",
  "option4": "4 years",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 years",
  "explanation": "$latex A = P(1 + \\\\frac{R}{100})^{T}&s=1$\r\n$latex => 30000 + 4373 = 30000\\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{7}{100} \\\\right )^{T}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{34347}{30000} = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{107}{100} \\\\right )^{T}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{11449}{10000} = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{107}{100} \\\\right )^{T}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\left ( \\\\frac{107}{100} \\\\right )^{2}= \\\\left ( \\\\frac{107}{100} \\\\right )^{T}&s=1$\r\n$latex \\\\therefore Time = 2\\\\ years$\r\nHence option [A] is correct answer"
