  "option2": "chlorine",
  "option3": "bromine",
  "option4": "iodine",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "fluorine",
  "explanation": "The bonds in these diatomic molecules are non-polar covalent single bonds. However, halogens readily combine with most elements and are never seen uncombined in nature. As a general rule, fluorine is the most reactive halogen and astatine is the least reactive."
