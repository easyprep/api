  "question": "Chips used in integrated circuits in computers are made of which of the following materials?",
  "option1": "Mica",
  "option2": "Manganese",
  "option3": "Silicon",
  "option4": "Zinc",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Silicon",
  "explanation": "Pure silicon is the basis for most integrated circuits. It provides the base or substrate for the entire chip and is chemically doped to provide the N and P regions that make up the integrated circuit components. The silicon must be so pure that only one out of every ten billion atoms can be an impurity."
