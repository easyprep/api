  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe terracotta grinder is to replace the traditional mortar and pestle that is used to grind up broken pieces of pottery. This powder is used along with clay to make more pottery. It reduces the need for clay and also increase the pots’ strength.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe IRCTC and Zonal railways are set to replace plastic cups with kulhad cups for serving tea. This concept was initially introduced in 2004 to reduce plastics as well as increase support to the pottery sector. This is about to make a comeback.\n&nbsp;"
