  "answer": "Kolkata",
  "explanation": "this year. There will be six coaches, while some of the latest features include push-button start and stop, advanced automation. Along with this, it has track-synced safe signaling system and a remote operation hub to operate an ATC tower of an airport. The rakes are being manufactured by Bengaluru based BEML (Bharat Earth Movers Limited). The fundamental operative difference between the current rakes and the new rakes is that the old rakes have a lever, which brings the engine to life and makes the rake move. The lever is put to neutral, once the train reaches optimum speed, and the train approaches a station, the lever is pulled again, making it halt.",
