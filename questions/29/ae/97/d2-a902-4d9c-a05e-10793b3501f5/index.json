The tunnel has 44 trolley refuges and 14 cross-passages in a horseshoe design. It is built in the shape of a \\'horse shoe\\' using the New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM) at a cost of Rs 437 crore. The height of tunnel (rail level to roof) is 6.5m and the minimum height of contact wire is maintained at 5.2m. The track is constructed without using Ballast by providing Bi-block sleepers and Vaslo fittings. There are LED lights at an interval of every 10 metres inside the travel. The newly constructed tunnel will provide seamless rail connectivity between the Krishnapatnam Port and the hinterland areas."
