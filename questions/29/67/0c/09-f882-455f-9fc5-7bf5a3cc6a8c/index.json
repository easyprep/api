  "question": "Which of the following is / are correct statements? <ol> <li>Only Rajya Sabha can enable the parliament to make a law on a matter enumerated in the State List</li> <li>Voting on demands for grants is the exclusive privilege of Lok sabha</li> </ol> Which of the above is/are correct statements?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 and 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2",
  "explanation": "Both the statements are correct. Rajya Sabha being a federal chamber enjoys certain special powers under the Constitution. All the subjects/areas regarding legislation have been divided into three Lists - Union List, State List and concurrent List. Union and State Lists are mutually exclusive - one cannot legislate on a matter placed in the sphere of the other. However, if Rajya Sabha passes a resolution by a majority of not less than two-thirds of members present and voting saying that it is “necessary or expedient in the national interest” that Parliament should make a law on a matter enumerated in the State List, Parliament becomes empowered to make a law on the subject specified in the resolution, for the whole or any part of the territory of India. Such a resolution remains in force for a maximum period of one year but this period can be extended by one year at a time by passing a similar resolution further. Rajya Sabha does not have powers in matters of voting for demand for grants and it is the exclusive right of Lok Sabha."
