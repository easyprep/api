  "question": "Which state government will launch awareness programme \"Sanskar\" against superstition?",
  "option1": "Uttar Pradesh",
  "option2": "West Bengal",
  "option3": "Assam",
  "option4": "Kerala",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Assam",
  "explanation": "The Assam government will soon launch an awareness programme -- \\'Sanskar\\'-- in all development blocks and panchayats. The move is taken in the wake of incidents triggered by superstition and ignorance including the lynching of two young artistes in Karbi Anglong district of the state. The Assam Science Technology and Environment Council (ASTEC) would be the nodal agency and the programme would involve all deputy commissioners, superintendents of police and all government departments concerned in a district. Local bodies, womens\\' organisations, voluntary organizations, media persons, leading citizens, academicians, MPs and MLAs from ruling and opposition parties would be stakeholders of the programme. Social activist Birubala Rabha, who has been tirelessly fighting against witch-hunting, will also be involved in the programme."
