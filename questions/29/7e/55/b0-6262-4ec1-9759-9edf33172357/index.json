  "option1": "Bangladesh",
  "option2": "Pakistan",
  "option3": "Sri Lanka",
  "option4": "India",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Sri Lanka",
  "explanation": "Sri Lanka has become the first South Asian nation to criminalize several offences related to match-fixing after it passed a bill labelled \\\"Prevention of Offences Related to Sports\\\" in which offences related to corruption in sports will carry a prison term of up to 10 years, as well as various fines. The legislation not only seeks to punish any person related to a sport who is directly involved in fixing, but also those who provide inside information. If a curator prepares a pitch to benefit betting operators or any other ground staff or support staff receives money or any other reward to disclose the condition of the playing surface comes under the ambit of a criminal offence."
