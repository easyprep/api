Narcondam hornbill is an IUCN red list species of hornbill in the Bucerotidae family endemic to the Indian island of Narcondam in the Andaman’s. It is a small hornbill at 66 cm long and males and females differ in their plumage features, the male has a rufous head and neck, black body and upper parts glossed with green but females are all black. The entire population is restricted to the single island of Narcondam in the Andaman Island chain at a height of about 2300 feet above sea level and is largely devoid of human presence. The island is often hit by cyclonic storms in the Bay of Bengal and human activities have created threats to the species in contemporary times. Several Conservationists and groups protested to take care of the species owing to small area of island and much exposure to the species in tropical forests."
