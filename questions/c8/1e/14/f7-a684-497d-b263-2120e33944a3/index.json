  "question": "In context with the issue of expanding ravines surrounding the River Mahi, consider the following statements about this river:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It originates in Gujarat.</li>\n<li>It opens into the Arabian Sea at the Gulf of Kutch.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe River Mahi originates in Madhya Pradesh. The river starts from the Dhar district in Vindhyas. The river flows through the states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. It is one of the west flowing rivers of India.Â \n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe river drains into the Arabian Sea at the Gulf of Khambhat. The Gulf of Khambhat is located south of Gujarat. The silt brought in by the river had made the Gulf of Khambhat shallow and hence led to its loss of significance as an important port."
