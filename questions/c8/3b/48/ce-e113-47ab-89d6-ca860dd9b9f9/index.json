  "question": "What is the shape of XeF<sub>4</sub> molecule?",
  "option1": "T-shaped",
  "option2": "Bent",
  "option3": "See-saw",
  "option4": "Square planar",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Square planar",
  "explanation": "The shape of XeF<sub>4</sub> molecule is Square planar. As per VSEPR theory, there is repulsion between lone pair electrons and bond pair electrons as a result the Xenon tetrafluoride becomes square planar to achieve the stable state."
