  "answer": "Direct election of the governor is incompatible with the parliamentary system",
  "explanation": "Following are the reasons for the system of appointment of Governor by the President-<br />1. The direct election of the governor is incompatible with the parliamentary system in the states.<br />2. Direct election is more likely to create conflicts between the governor and the chief minister.<br />3. There is no need to make elaborate arrangements for this election as he/she is just a nominal head.<br />4. Since the election of a governor is on personal issues, it is not in the national interest to involve a large number of voters in such an election.<br />5. An elected governor would not be a neutral person as he/she would naturally belong to a party.<br />6. The election of governor would create separatist tendencies.<br />7. The system of presidential nomination enables the Centre to maintain its control over the states.<br />8. Direct election of the governor creates a problem of leadership at the time of a general election in the state.<br />9. The chief minister would like his nominee to contest for governorship which is not desirable."
