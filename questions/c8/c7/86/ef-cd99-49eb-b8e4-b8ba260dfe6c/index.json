  "question": "The \"Galapagos Islands\" are under the administration of which country?",
  "option1": "United States of America",
  "option2": "Brazil",
  "option3": "Colombia",
  "option4": "Ecuador",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Ecuador",
  "explanation": "The Galapagos Islands are an archipelago of volcanic islands under the administration of Ecuador, located in the Pacific Ocean. Wolf Volcano forms its highest point. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. These 19 islands and the surrounding marine reserve have been called a unique ‘living museum and showcase of evolution’. Located at the confluence of three ocean currents, the Galápagos are a ‘melting pot’ of marine species. The ongoing seismic and volcanic activity reflects the processes that formed the islands. These processes, together with the extreme isolation of the islands, led to the development of unusual animal life – such as the land iguana, the giant tortoise and the many types of finch – that inspired Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection following his visit in 1835."
