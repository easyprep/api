  "question": "Which one of the following pairs is correctly matched?",
  "option1": "Harappan Civilisation ... Painted Grey Ware",
  "option2": "The Kushans ... Gandhara School of Art",
  "option3": "The Mughals ... Ajanta Paintings",
  "option4": "The Marathas ... Pahari School of Painting",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "The Kushans ... Gandhara School of Art",
  "explanation": "Gandhara School was based on Greco-Roman norms encapsulating foreign techniques and an alien spirit. It is also known as Graeco-Buddhist School of art. Grey sandstone is used in Gandhara School of Art.<br />The Kushans fostered a mixed culture that is best illustrated by the variety of deities—Greco-Roman, Iranian, and Indian—invoked on their coins. At least two major stylistic divisions can be made among artifacts of the period: imperial art of Iranian derivation and Buddhist art of mixed Greco-Roman and Indian sources. <br />The best examples of the former are gold coins issued by the seven Kushan kings, the Kushan royal portraits (e.g., the Kanishka statue), and princely portraits found at Surkh-Kotal in Afghanistan. The style of Kushan artworks is stiff, hieratic, and frontal. Anatomy and drapery are stylized in the early period, and they are in stark contrast to the second style, which is typified by the Gandhara and Mathura schools of Kushan art.\r\n&nbsp;"
