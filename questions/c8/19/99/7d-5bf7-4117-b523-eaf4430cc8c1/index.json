  "question": "Who among the following established that genetic code of all organisms is spelled out in three-letter words, each set of three nucleotides codes for a specific amino acid?",
  "option1": "Hargobind Khorana",
  "option2": "Barbara McClintock",
  "option3": "Theodor O. Diener",
  "option4": "Joseph L. Goldstein",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Hargobind Khorana",
  "explanation": "Hargobind Khuranaâ€™s work on the interpretation of the genetic code and its function in protein synthesis, showing how the order of nucleotides in nucleic acids, which carry the genetic code of the cell, encode the proteins synthesized by the cell . They established the biological language or genetic code common to all living organisms, is spelled out in three-letter words: each set of three nucleotides codes for a specific amino acid."
