The challenge will be a part of the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention which will be held on 2nd of October 2018. The proposals have been invited by the MoHUA from interested innovators, companies, academic institutions, research and development centers, NGOs and municipal bodies, to provide innovative technical solutions which eliminate the need for human entry into sewers. According to the 2011 census, there were more than 2 million toilets in the country which had to either be serviced manually or disposed waste into open drains."
