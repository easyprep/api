  "question": "China is constructing hydro power plants on the Yarlung Zangbo River. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The Yarlung Zangbo is also called Brahmaputra River.</li>\n<li>China has flood information sharing pact with India only with respect to the Sutlej River.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nYarlung Zangbo is the stretch of Brahmaputra River that flows through Tibet Autonomous Region. The river is sourced from Angsi Glacier in Western Tibet. China has 1 completed and 2 in-progress hydropower plants on this river. Recently, it claimed that all 3 projects are run-of-the-river type and will not store water. It also claimed that as an upper riparian state, it uses barely 1% of the water.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nIndia and China has flood information sharing pact with respect to 2 rivers: Sutlej and Brahmaputra. Both rivers originate in Tibet. The pact signed in 2006 provides that China would share hydrological data with India between May and October. The real time information shared by China in 2018 helped manage the above normal flood levels in Brahmaputra."
