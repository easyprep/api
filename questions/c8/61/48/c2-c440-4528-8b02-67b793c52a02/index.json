  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "First statement is incorrect because Coal Bed Methane (CBM) is natural gas found in coal seams. It is mainly composed of Methane (CH4) with minor amounts of nitrogen, carbon dioxide and heavier hydrocarbons like ethane. Second statement is incorrect because Great Eastern Energy Corp. Ltd (GEECL), Essar Oil Ltd and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) are the three existing players selling CBM gas in the market. Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has recently begun commercial production of coal bed methane (CBM) gas from two blocks in Madhya Pradesh. The two blocks are located in Sohagpur East and West."
