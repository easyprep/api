  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nNanakpanthi is any follower of Guru Nanak and believes his teachings. This is irrespective of religion. This is also because the core philosophy of Guru Nanak is oneness that transcends religion. It has been highlighted in light of Kartarpur corridor project allowing only Sikh pilgrims.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nNanakpanthi or Nanank Naam Lewas are found in several countries apart from India. Guru Nanak, in the 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> centuries travelled far and wide to interact with various cultural groups. He travelled and shared ideas with Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Tibet, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, etc."
