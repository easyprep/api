  "question": "In October, the President of Indonesia Joko Widodo was re-elected for a second term. In this context, consider the following statements about presidency in Indonesia:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Indonesian president is only the head of the state and not of the government.</li>\n<li>A person who served two terms as president previously cannot be re-elected.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nIn Indonesia, the office of president is the head of the state and also the head of the government. This is unlike in India, where the president is only the head of the state or de jure head. The Indonesian president is also the commander-in-chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nA person who had served as a president for 2 terms previously cannot be re-elected to the office in Indonesia. The term of office is five years. Also a minimum age requirement of 35 years applies. Only an Indonesian citizen can run for presidency."
