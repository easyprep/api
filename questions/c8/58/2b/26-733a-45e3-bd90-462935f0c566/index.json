  "answer": "Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation",
  "explanation": "The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced a USD 170 million projects aimed at advancing women's economic empowerment in India, Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. Projects in these countries are focused on four key priorities - advancing gender equality, increasing job opportunities, spreading digital financial inclusion, and supporting the agricultural sector and women's support groups. Earlier, in 2016, the foundation had committed USD 80 million for gender data, advocacy and accountability. USD 20 million out of USD 80 million was allocated for supporting women's movements. Based on data, the foundation believes that when a woman has the option of working outside the home and access to financial services to participate in the formal economy, families start emerging above the poverty line, which consequentially leads to a rise in national Gross Domestic Product (GDP).",
