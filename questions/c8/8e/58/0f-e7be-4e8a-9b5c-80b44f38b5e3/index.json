  "answer": "1 & 2 Only",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is correct</u>. The Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), a statutory body of the Department of Science and Technology (DST) has recently launched a “Visiting Advanced Joint Research (VAJRA) Faculty Scheme”. <u>Second statement is correct</u>. The scheme aims to connect the Indian academic and research development systems to the best of global science and scientists. Under the scheme VAJRA Faculty is provided US Dollars 15000 in the first month of residence and US Dollars 10000 in each of the subsequent month. <u>Third statement is incorrect.</u> This is not a centrally sponsored scheme but a Central Plan Scheme and hence no State/UT-wise allocation is made. The residency period of the VAJRA Faculty in India would be for a minimum of 1 month and a maximum of 3 months a year."
