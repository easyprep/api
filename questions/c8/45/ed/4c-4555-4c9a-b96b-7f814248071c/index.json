  "question": "The current El-Nino year of 2015, has been often termed as &quot;double El Nino&quot; by many scientists. Which of the following best defines &quot;double El-Nino&quot;?",
  "option1": "Two consecutive years of the concentration of warm water in the Pacific Ocean.",
  "option2": "Combination of El-Nino with Indian Ocean Dipole to give multiple impacts.",
  "option3": "El-Nino in combination with poor local weather.",
  "option4": "El-Nino year not immediately followed by La-Nina year.",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Two consecutive years of the concentration of warm water in the Pacific Ocean.",
  "explanation": "Normally, the warm water from an El Nino spreads across the Pacific and cools as it evaporates. The increased moisture in the air leads to thunderstorms and tropical storms. That hasn&rsquo;t happened as much as anticipated over the last year.&nbsp;Infact, two consecutive years of the concentration of warm water in the Pacific Ocean has disturbed the weather across different parts of the world."
