The goal of this initiative is to reduce preventable maternal and newborn mortality, morbidity and stillbirths associated with the care around delivery in Labour room. The Safe Delivery Application is an m-Health tool that can be used for health workers who manage normal and complicated deliveries in the peripheral areas. It can play a pivotal role in training, post-training reinforcement, mentoring and demonstration.",
