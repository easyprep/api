  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Sewa Service trains were launched to connect far-flung remote areas of the country. These places are selected because they cannot avail the service of premier trains. The 9 trains that were launched will operate in 8 states. 4 trains will operate on a daily basis.\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThis is under the ‘Sweating of Assets’ initiative of the Indian railway. By this initiative, the Indian Railway seeks to achieve better utilisation of its rolling stocks without resorting to new procurement. The Sewa Service trains will serve as link trains to the people of remote areas.\n&nbsp;"
