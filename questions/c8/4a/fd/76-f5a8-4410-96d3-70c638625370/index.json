  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 & 3 Only",
  "explanation": "An&nbsp;artificial ecosystem&nbsp;meets all the criteria of a natural&nbsp;ecosystem&nbsp;but is made and controlled by humans. It is created to mimic a natural&nbsp;ecosystem but often is less complex and with a very low genetic diversity. Orchards, farmlands, a garden and man-made reservoirs are some examples of&nbsp;artificial ecosystems."
