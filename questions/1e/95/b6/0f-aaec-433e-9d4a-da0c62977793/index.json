  "explanation": "The think tank of the Union Government, NITI Aayog has advised Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL), to use an indigenously designed, developed and manufactured (IDDM) solution for its 4G network.\r\nEarlier, the Government also urged that both BSNL and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam (MTNL) must not use Chinese equipment for the 4G services. BSNL has floated a 4G tender and if NITI Aayogâ€™s recommendation is accepted, it could have an adverse impact on global telecom gear manufacturers, from both China and Europe."
