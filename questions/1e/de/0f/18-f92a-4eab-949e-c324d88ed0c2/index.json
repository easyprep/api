  "question": "Currently, India charges what fraction of the adjusted gross revenues (AGR) as license fee from telecom operators, due to which telecom operators claim that they are badly hit?",
  "option1": 0.05,
  "option2": 0.08,
  "option3": 0.1,
  "option4": 0.12,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 0.08,
  "explanation": "India levies license fees of 8% of adjusted gross revenues (AGR) from every telecom license holder. The SC on October 24 defined AGR as all revenues of a license holder, and not just revenues from telecom services. Apart from dealing a body blow to telcos, the order also made non-telecom companies holding licenses for internal communications and signaling liable to pay license fees on their entire revenue, even when they do not offer any telecom services."
