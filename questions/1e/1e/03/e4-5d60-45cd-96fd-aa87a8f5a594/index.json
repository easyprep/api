  "question": "With regards to the recent dispute in the currency system of Yemen, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>New Yemeni Riyals are not recognised in the Houthi controlled regions of Yemen.</li>\n<li>The Central Bank of Yemen is located in Aden.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Houthi rebels had recently banned the use of the new Yemeni Riyal issued by the internationally recognised government of Yemen. The Houthi- controlled areas are to make use of the old banknotes while the area under the control of the Aden based government are to use the new banknotes. This conflict over the currency system has affected the already struggling Yemeni economy.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Central Bank of Yemen is located in Aden. The apex bank was relocated to the temporary capital of the recognised Yemen government in light of the Yemen civil war. The ongoing issue over the banknotes has affected the exchange rate of the Yemeni Riyals."
