  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe DST had put forth the SSR policy along the lines of Corporate Social Responsibility concept. One of its proposals is to mandate scientists to spend a minimum of 10 days imparting knowledge to the public in a year. The scientists would also have their SSR work evaluated periodically.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe scientific institutions would not be allowed to outsource their SSR work. Most of the scientific work is funded by public money. Hence, the policy seeks to give back to the society. The draft policy also proposes incentives for the scientists’ outreach activities."
