  "answer": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Insects have two common types of metamorphosis. Grasshoppers, crickets, dragonflies, and cockroaches have incomplete metamorphosis. The young (called a nymph) usually look like small adults but without the wings. Butterflies, moths, beetles, flies and bees have complete metamorphosis.

There are four stages in the metamorphosis of butterflies, moths and housefly viz. egg, larva, pupa, and adult."
