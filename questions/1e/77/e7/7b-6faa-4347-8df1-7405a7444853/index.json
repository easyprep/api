It is practiced by tribal and also known as Burn and slash cultivation. It is known as jhoom in Assam, Onam in Kerala, Podu in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. The same is known as Bewar in Madhya Pradesh. Over a large part of Northeastern India the chief characteristics of shifting cultivation, while having different local names are found to be the same. These are\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>rotation of fields</li>\r\n<li>use of fire for clearing the land</li>\r\n<li>keeping the land fallow for regeneration for a number of years</li>\r\n<li>use of human labour as main input</li>\r\n<li>non-employment of draught animals</li>\r\n<li>nonÂ·use of the plough, but instead very crude and simple implements such as dibble sticks and scrapers, are used, and</li>\r\n<li>all the crops being grown are mixed together.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFurthermore, in most parts of Northeast India it is found that hunting and gathering is an important subsidiary occupation of the shifting cultivators."
