  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nFPI is a passive investment. The investors invest in the financial assets of a company and play little to no role in controlling its activities. The investors usually look for short term gains. Such investments bring in capital inflows but not much technological transfers and other benefits.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nForeign direct investments involve the investment of a foreign investor in a company’s (in another country) physical assets. The role of the investor is active here. FDIs take place use joint ventures, mergers, etc. It results in funds, technology transfer and also transfer of other resources."
