As the lock-down has stopped the production of jute bags in the state, the Food Corporation of India faces a shortage of bags.\r\nUnion Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan announced that the government has allowed packaging of food-grains in used gunny sacks and plastic bags during the ongoing procurement season. A task force has been constituted by the Ministry to assess the shortage of jute bags for packaging amid the lock-down."
