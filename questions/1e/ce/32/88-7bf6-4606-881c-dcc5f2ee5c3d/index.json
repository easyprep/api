  "question": "A free-floating astronaut ‘A’ pushes another free-floating astronaut ‘B’ in space. The mass of ‘A’ is greater than that of ‘B’. The force exerted by the astronaut ‘A’ on the astronaut ‘B’ will be?",
  "option1": "Equal to zero",
  "option2": "Equal to the force exerted by ‘B’ on ‘A’",
  "option3": "Greater than the force exerted by ‘B’ on ‘A’.",
  "option4": "Less than the force exerted by ‘B’ on ‘A’",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Equal to zero",
  "explanation": "An <em>astronaut</em> is <em>floating</em> around in the space and gives another person a <em>push</em>. Newton\\'s third law says that if he <em>pushes</em> the other person, it <em>will push</em> back on him with an equal and opposite <em>force</em>.<br />So the force exterted will be zero."
