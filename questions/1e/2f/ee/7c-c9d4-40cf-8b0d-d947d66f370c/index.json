  "answer": "Tea Industry",
  "explanation": "The recent report by Greenpeace alleges the presence of pesticide residues in Indian tea. The Indian tea industry loses nearly 30 per cent of its crop due to pests, weeds and diseases.&nbsp;To deal with such problems the Tea Board of India has issued Plant Protection Code (PPC), a set of guidelines for regulating the chemical inputs in tea cultivation, on January 1, 2015. The aim is to make Indian tea a safe and healthy drink. It deals with safe usage of crop protection products and methodologies that would be followed to reduce pesticide residues in tea. The code encourages tea growers to critically review their plant protection formulations (PPF), which are a list of chemicals that are used in tea."
