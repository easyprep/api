  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "All of the above given factors are responsible for tides on earth.The daily pattern of high and low tides is not caused by the changing position of the sun and moon, but is directly caused by the rotation of the earth. Because the earth takes one day to rotate about its own axis, the high tide/low tide cycle repeats twice a day. The reason that there are two high-tide/low-tide cycles every day is because there are two tidal bulges and not one.&nbsp;"
