  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about commercial fishing?<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The most favourable areas for growth of fish are the deep waters of the oceans.</li>\r\n<li>Convergence of warm and cold currents also promotes blending of water making fishing less remunerative.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Commercial fishing activity is largely concentrated in the oceans of the Northern Hemisphere. The most favourable areas for growth of fish are the shallow waters of the oceans. Convergence of warm and cold currents also promotes blending of water beneficial to fish culture through the process of cooler water displacing warmer water. These areas are favourable for fishing activities."
