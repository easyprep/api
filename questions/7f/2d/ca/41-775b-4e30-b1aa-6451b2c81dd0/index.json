  "question": "Which of the following crops has the highest photosynthetic activity?",
  "option1": "Cotton",
  "option2": "Sugarcane",
  "option3": "Rice",
  "option4": "Wheat",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Sugarcane",
  "explanation": "Among the above all, the sugarcane has the highest photosynthetic activity. Photosynthesis is a chemical process that occurs in many forms of bacteria and virtually all plants, including aquatic plants and algae. The rate of photosynthesis in a plant is dependent on the environmental changes, as well as to intrinsic features of plant. The photosynthetic rate in sugarcane is directly related with the variation of solar radiation during the day."
