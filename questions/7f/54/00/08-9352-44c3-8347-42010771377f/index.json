  "option1": "1 and 3",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "2 only",
  "option4": "1 only",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 only",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nShanghai is the world’ busiest port. However, Hong Kong ports are also considered to be among the world’s busiest. Most of the port traffic passes through the Victoria port. It was originally called the Hong Kong port. The protests have now reached the port in order to gain wider international exposure.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nHong Kong is a free capitalistic economy and has well developed infrastructure. It has the largest number of skyscrapers in the world. They also have other favourable conditions like some of the world’s highest life expectancy, high per capita income etc. \n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe region is highly dependent on imports for food. A very low percent of the land is arable. 90% of food- including meat- is from imports. It is one of the largest exporters and importers. The protest is affecting its status as a major international financial centre.  \n&nbsp;"
