  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Leang Bulu Sipong 4 cave is in Indonesia. It is located in the Sulawesi Island region, which is east of Borneo. The cave contained paintings of animals like wild pigs and buffalo and human like figures on a 5m wide panel.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe 44,000 year old painting is not the oldest known painting. That title is held by a South African specimen that is 73,000 years old. The Indonesian cave painting was dated by measuring the radioactive isotopes in the calcites that had developed on the images."
