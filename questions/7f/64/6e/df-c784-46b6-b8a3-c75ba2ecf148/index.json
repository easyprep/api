  "question": "The sparkling of a diamond is due to which of the following phenomena?",
  "option1": "Total internal reflection of light",
  "option2": "Interference of light",
  "option3": "Polarisation of light",
  "option4": "Refraction of light",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Total internal reflection of light",
  "explanation": "Total internal reflection, coupled with a large index of refraction, explains why diamonds sparkle more than other materials. The critical angle for a diamond-to-air surface is only 24.4ยบ, and so when light enters a diamond, it has trouble getting back out."
