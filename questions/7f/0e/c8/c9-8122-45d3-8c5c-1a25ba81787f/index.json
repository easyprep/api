  "question": "In reference to the recent SC ruling on internet shutdown, consider the following statements about this exercise:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The SC ruled that internet access is a fundamental right.</li>\r\n<li>The power to issue an order for internet shutdown is vested with the home ministry.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe Supreme Court recently ruled that the internet is a medium for exercising fundamental right but didnâ€™t label it as a fundamental right. The SC recognised the validity of the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Service) Rules issued in 2017 under the Telegraph Act for suspension of internet service.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct: </strong>\r\nThe Secretary to the union ministry of home affairs is the recognised authority for issuing orders for internet shutdowns. The internet suspension can be done in case of public emergency and in interest of the public safety."
