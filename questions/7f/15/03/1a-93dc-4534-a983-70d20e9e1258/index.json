  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "The Public Accounts Committee consists of not more than 22 members comprising 15 members elected by Lok Sabha every year from amongst its members according to the principle of proportional representation by means of single transferable vote and not more than 7 members of Rajya Sabha elected by that House in like manner are associated with the Committee. So, the first statement is correct. The Chairman is appointed by the Speaker from amongst its members of Lok Sabha. So statement 2 is incorrect. The Speaker, for the first time, appointed a member of the Opposition as the Chairman of the Committee for 1967-68. This practice has been continued since then. A Minister is not eligible to be elected as a member of the Committee. If a member after his election to the Committee is appointed a Minister, he ceases to be a member of the Committee from the date of such appointment. The Public Account Committee carries out the examination of the Appropriation Accounts relating to the Railways, Defence Services, P&amp;T Department and other Civil Ministries of the Government of India and Reports of the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India thereon as also the Reports of the Comptroller and Auditor-General on Revenue Receipts mainly form the basis of the deliberation of the Committee. The Comptroller and Auditor General is the “friend, philosopher and guide” of the Committee. He attends the sittings of the Committee and assists it in its deliberations. So statement 3 is correct."
