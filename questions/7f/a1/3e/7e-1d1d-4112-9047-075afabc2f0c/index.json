  "question": "The retreating Monsoon gives rainfall to which of the following places of India?</span>",
  "option1": "Gujarat",
  "option2": "Tamilnadu",
  "option3": "Rajasthan",
  "option4": "Maharashtra",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Tamilnadu",
  "explanation": "During the time of September, with the retreating of the sun towards the south, the northern landmass of the Indian subcontinent begins to cool off rapidly. When the air pressure begins to build over northern India, the Indian Ocean and its atmosphere still holds its heat. This causes cold wind to flow from the Himalayas and Indo-Gangetic Plain towards the Indian Ocean south of the Deccan peninsula. This is known as the Northeast Monsoon or the Retreating Monsoon.</span>"
