  "explanation": "By 1900, Aurobindo Ghosh had started to think to launch a secret society for the growth of revolutionary cult in India. He sent Jatin Banerjee, a young Bengali soldier belonging to the army of Baroda to Bengal in 1900 and two year later (1902) Barinder Kumar Ghosh, his brother with the mission of setting up a revolutionary organization there. It was with their efforts that the first proper revolutionary secret society known as Anushilan Samiti (Calcutta) was founded on 24 March 1902 by Pramath Nath Mitra (P. Mitra). The name of Anushilan Samiti was taken from the Bankim Chandraâ€™s one of writing of that name."
