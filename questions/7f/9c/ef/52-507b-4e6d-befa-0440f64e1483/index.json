  "question": "The stubble burning season commenced in late September in states like Punjab and Haryana. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Stubble burning in India is done to speed up paddy cultivation.</li>\n<li>Stubble burning helps reduce incidence of pests and weeds.</li>\n<li>Stubble burning is higher during the Kharif season.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Only 3 is correct",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nStubble burning is the practice of setting fire to the stubble after harvesting. In India, the practice is prevalent in northern states like Punjab, UP and Haryana. It is done to clear away the paddy stubble to help speed up wheat cultivation in the winter.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe stubble burning helps in reducing incidence of pest and weeds. While this helps in reducing the need for pesticides and herbicides, it causes rampant pollution. The air quality deteriorates affecting the health of the farming community and also far off urban places like Delhi.\n<strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe stubble burning is mostly practiced during the start of Rabi season. The season starts in late September- early October. The practice is used in autumn to clear off the paddy stubble and sow wheat. The government has banned the practice and instead calls for the use of Happy Seeders and Super SMS."
