  "answer": "Pattabhi Sitaramaiyya",
  "explanation": "Subhash Chandra Bose, who had been the Congress President for a year, desired another one-year term at the end of 1938. Subhash felt the German threat to Britain in the Second World War was an opportunity to launch an all-out mass disobedience movement to kick out the British. However, Gandhi didnâ€™t favour a second term for Subhash. Subhash was adamant, and a contest ensued: Subhas vs. Pattabhi Sitaramayya of Andhra PCC. Sitaramayya was backed by Gandhi. Subhash was re-elected by 1580 to 1375 votes on 29 January 1939. However, Subhash faced several issues and resigned in April 1939. He announced formation of the Forward Bloc within the Congress in May 1939. His place as Congress President was taken by Dr. Rajendra Prasad."
