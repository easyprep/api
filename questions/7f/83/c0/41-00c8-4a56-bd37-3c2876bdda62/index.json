  "question": "For which of the following waves the Doppler effect holds true?",
  "option1": "Sound waves",
  "option2": "Electromagnetic waves",
  "option3": "Both a and b",
  "option4": "None",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both a and b",
  "explanation": "Doppler effect is a wave phenomenon and it holds not only for sound waves but also for electromagnetic waves. When we approach a stationary source of sound with high speed, the pitch of the sound heard appears to be higher than that of the source. As the observer recedes away from the source, the observed pitch (or frequency) becomes lower than that of the source. This motion-related frequency change is called Doppler effect."
