  "question": "Which among the following is a matching set of activities?",
  "option1": "Water stored in a tank, wound up spring watch, stretched spring, speeding train",
  "option2": "A shooting star, a flying bird, blowing wind, a stone lying on the top of roof",
  "option3": "Lifting a load, climbing a staircase, pulling a toy, Pushing a lawn mover",
  "option4": "Wound-up spring, stretched bow, stone lying on the roof, moving car",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Lifting a load, climbing a staircase, pulling a toy, Pushing a lawn mover",
  "explanation": "<strong>Water stored in a tank, wound up spring watch, stretched spring, speeding train.</strong><br> In this set, speeding train possesses kinetic energy but other have potential energy.<br> <strong>A shooting star, a flying bird, blowing wind, a stone lying on the top of roof.</strong><br> In this case, a stone lying on the top of roof: A stone lying on the top of roof possesses potential energy but other possesses kinetic energy.<br> <strong>Lifting a load, climbing a staircase, pulling a toy, Pushing a lawn mover</strong><br> This is a matching set, all examples of work being done.<br> <strong>Wound-up spring, stretched bow, stone lying on the roof, moving car.</strong><br> In this case, moving car possesses kinetic energy but other have potential energy"
