  "question": "Which of these means opposite phase of particles?",
  "option1": "phase difference between the particle is an odd multiple of π",
  "option2": "if the path difference is an odd multiple of (<span class='symbol'>λ </span>/ 2)",
  "option3": "if the time interval is an odd multiple of T/2",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "Opposite Phase means: phase difference between the particle is an odd multiple of π or if the path difference is an odd multiple of (<span class=\\'symbol\\'>λ</span> / 2) or if the time interval is an odd multiple of T/2"
