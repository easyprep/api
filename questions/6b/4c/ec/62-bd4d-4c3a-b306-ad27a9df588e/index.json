  "question": "&nbsp; &nbsp;Consider the following statements about the composite floor test: <ol> <li>The Governor of a state calls for a composite floor test when more than one person are staking claim to form government and majority is not clear</li> <li>To win the floor test, a party requires special majority</li> </ol> &nbsp; &nbsp;Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct because if there is more than one person staking claim to form the government and the majority is not clear, the governor may call for a special session to see who has the majority. Second statement is incorrect because some legislators may be absent or choose not to vote. The majority is then counted based on those present and voting. To win the floor test, a party requires simple majority. The term was in news due to Tamil Nadu political crisis, where the Governor called for the composite floor test to see the majority. Out of the total 234 MLAs in the Tamil Nadu Assembly, Palanisamy needs 117 MLAs&nbsp;to win the floor test."
