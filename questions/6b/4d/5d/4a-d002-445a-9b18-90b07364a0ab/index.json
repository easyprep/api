  "question": "Which space agency has revealed that giant asteroid 99942 Apophis is expected to fly close to Earth in a decade?",
  "option1": "NASA",
  "option2": "Roscosmos",
  "option3": "JAXA",
  "option4": "CNES",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "NASA",
  "explanation": "According to the latest data from US space agency NASA, the  giant asteroid named 99942 Apophis is expected to approach  dangerously close to the Earth on April 13, 2029. However, there is no need to worry as it will be about 31,000km away from the surface of the Earth.  This is going to be a great opportunity for asteroid scientists as it\\'s relatively rare for such a large object to pass so close to the Earth. The colossal asteroid is named after the Egyptian god of chaos and destruction. Apophis was discovered in 2004 by U.S. astronomers. Since then, optical and radar telescopes have tracked Apophis as it continues on its orbit around the sun, so scientists know well its future trajectory. Current calculations shows that Apophis still has a small chance of impacting earth."
