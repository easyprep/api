  "option1": "While in meditation",
  "option2": "While asked some unanswerable questions",

  "option4": "While asked on matters of inner peace",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "While asked some unanswerable questions",
  "explanation": "Buddha kept noble silence when he knew that the questions were not in a position to understand the answer to the question because of its profundity, or if the questions themselves were wrongly put in the first place. By realizing the true nature of the issues asked he remained silent. His silence on these questions was interpreted as much more meaningful than attempting to deliver thousands of discourses on them.
