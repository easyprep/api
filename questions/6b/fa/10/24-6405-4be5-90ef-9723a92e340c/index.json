  "question": "With reference to the observation of the international day against nuclear tests, consider the following statements about the verification regime:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The International Monitoring System (IMS) uses seismic data to detect nuclear explosions.</li>\n<li>CTBT member states can inspect sites in non-member states like India.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:<strong>Â </strong>",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe verification regime established under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty has the IMS at its core. It uses several tools to detect nuclear explosions conducted by the states. It uses seismic data to detect such explosions. However, the nuclear nature of explosion requires the radionuclide data for confirmation. Other data sources like hydroacoustics and infrasounds are also used by IMS.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe verification regime will become applicable after the CTBT is ratified. The member states can conduct on-site inspection in other states for compliance with CTBT. This is done when the initial data from radionucleid, hydroacoustic sources, etc. indicate a nuclear explosion in the country. This is not applicable to non-member states of CTBT like India."
