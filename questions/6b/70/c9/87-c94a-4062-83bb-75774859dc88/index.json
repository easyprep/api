  "question": "Why did the Sepoy mutiny of 1857 failed?",
  "option1": "Lack of effective organisation",
  "option2": "Lack of unity of purpose",
  "option3": "Lack of unified system of leadership",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "The Revolt of 1857 was localized and poorly organized. Due to lack of communication facilities, the sepoys of the widely dispersed cantonments could not act simultaneously in a concerted manner. The revolt did not spread to wider regions of the country. The armies of the Bombay and Madras presidencies remained loyal to the British. There was hardly any disturbance to the south of the Narmada, Sindh, the Punjab, the Northwestern Frontier province."
