  "answer": "remained neutral to the revolt of 1857",
  "explanation": "The revolt did not spread to all parts of the country. Nor was it supported by all groups and sections of the Indian society.

Many Indian rulers refused to help the rebels and some were openly hostile to the rebels and helped the British in suppressing the revolt. The middle and upper classes and the modern educated Indians also did not support the revolt."
