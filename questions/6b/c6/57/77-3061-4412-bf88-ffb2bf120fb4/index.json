  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe Commissionerate System of police is different from the usual dual system involving the Superintendent of Police and the District Magistrate. It is a unified system where the Commissioner of Police is vested with both the roles. It is already in use in several cities- Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Mumbai.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:   </strong>\r\nThe Commissioner of Police heads the Commissionerate System. He/ she is accountable to the state government. Police is a state subject. The use of this system was recommended by the 6<sup>th</sup> National Police Commission report in cities with populations of 5 lakh people and above and also in cities with special conditions."
