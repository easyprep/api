  "option1": "prevent cold waves from the sky from descending on Earth",
  "option2": "reflect back heat given off by Earth",
  "option3": "produce heat and radiate it towards Earth",
  "option4": "absorb heat from the atmosphere and send it towards Earth",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "reflect back heat given off by Earth",
  "explanation": "Cloudy nights are warmer compared to clear cloudless nights, because clouds Reflect back the heat given off by earth. At night cloud cover has the opposite effect. If skies are clear, heat emitted from the earth\\'s surface freely escapes into space, resulting in colder temperatures. However, if clouds are present, some of the heat emitted from the earth\\'s surface is trapped by the clouds and reemitted back towards the earth."
