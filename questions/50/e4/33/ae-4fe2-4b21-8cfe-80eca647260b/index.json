  "question": "Agent Smith malware is the current concern of the cybersecurity sector. In this context, consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>The malware affects android phones.</li>\n<li>It primarily affects Indian users.</li>\n<li>It makes use of the “Janus Vulnerability” of android systems.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "3 only",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 and 2",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe malware makes use of 3<sup>rd</sup> party app store to enter into android systems. It mainly enters through apps for gaming, photo editing and adult entertainment. It replaces innocent apps with malicious version. Though its current activity is confined to popping up advertisements, experts say it could cause more serious damage like bank credentials theft, eavesdropping, data theft, etc.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nA study by cybersecurity firm Checkpoint says that the malware has attacked 25 million devices. Of this, 59% were targeted at Indian victims- accounting for 15 million devices. This makes it a major concern for India. Other countries that were targeted include USA, UK, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Bangladesh.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe malware is advanced technology and not easily detectable. It does not display its icon on the screen. Also, it exploits the Janus Vulnerability- identified by researchers in 2017. This enables the malware to exist in the system without changing the original innocent app’s hash code. This makes it a challenge for the cybersecurity personnel."
