  "answer": "Body does not produce Insulin in Type1, does not respond properly in Type 2",
  "explanation": "Diabetes mellitus occurs when the body does not produce insulin (type I) or when the body does not respond properly to insulin (type II). This results in elevated blood glucose. In either type, overtreatment, or failure to eat properly while on treatment, can lead to hypoglycemia. Most diabetics recognize their symptoms when \\\"low\\\" and know to go eat something before it progresses to a dangerous point. Symptoms of high blood sugar are much different - thirst, increased urination, sleepiness."
