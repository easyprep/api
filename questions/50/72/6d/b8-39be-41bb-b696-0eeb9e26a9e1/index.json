  "question": "Which telescope has recently detected a huge X Ray burst from outer space?",
  "option1": "Hubble",
  "option2": "Spitzer",
  "option3": "Fermi",
  "option4": "NICER",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "NICER",
  "explanation": "NASAâ€™s NICER (Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer) telescope detected a sudden spike of X Rays. The spike was caused by a massive thermo nuclear flash on the surface of a pulsar. A Pulsar is a neutron star whose compact core is left behind when a massive star runs out of fuel. It later collapses under its own weight and explodes."
