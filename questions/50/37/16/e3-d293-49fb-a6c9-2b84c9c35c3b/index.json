  "question": "With reference to the recently discovered fossils of <em>Varanopid synapsid </em>which is reported to be the earliest evidence of parental care, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><em>Varanopid</em> is an ancient bird.</li>\r\n<li>They lived during the carboniferous period.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\n<em>Varanopid synapsid </em>is an ancient lizard like animal most noted for its resemblance to the present day monitor lizards. The recently found fossils in the Cape Brenton Island in Nova Scotia is reported to be the earliest example of parental care.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\n<em>Varanopid synapsids</em> lived during the late carboniferous period. During this period, terrestrial animals were established. This period was dominated by amphibians- a branch of which evolved into a category called ‘amniotes’ which were the first completely terrestrial organisms. The <em>Varanopids</em> belonged to this amniotes category."
