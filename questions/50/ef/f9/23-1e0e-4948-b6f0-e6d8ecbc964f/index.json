  "option5": "",
  "answer": "El Salvador",
  "explanation": "Joya de Ceren archaeological site is located in El Salvador. It is the only UNESCO World Heritage Site in El Salvador. This archaeological site manifests the impact of Maya Civilization on El Salvador's ancient history. Joya de Ceren is a pre-Columbian Maya farming village. This village is often referred to as the \"Pompei of the Americas\". It is a major tourist attraction of El Salvador. Joya de Cer√©n was a pre-Hispanic farming community that, like Pompeii and Herculaneum in Italy, was buried under an eruption of the Laguna Caldera volcano c. AD 600. Because of the exceptional condition of the remains, they provide an insight into the daily lives of the Central American populations who worked the land at that time."
