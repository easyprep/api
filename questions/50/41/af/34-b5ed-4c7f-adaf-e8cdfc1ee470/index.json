  "question": "Which of the following statements is/are correct about Alpine Tundra? <ol> <li>Alpine tundra occurs in middle latitude and at high altitudes</li> <li>The ground in the alpine tundra is permanently frozen and is called permafrost</li> </ol> Select the correct option from codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "Alpine tundra occurs in middle-latitude regions, but at very high regions. Due to thin layer of soil present in alpine tundra, only few plants species can survive in this region. In rocky alpine regions, lichens and mosses are the dominant plants, but in alpine meadows, grasses and small woody shrubs can be found at some places. Alpine tundra regions do not experience permafrost like arctic tundra."
