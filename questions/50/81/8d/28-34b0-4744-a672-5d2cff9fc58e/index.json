  "option3": "Force",
  "option4": "Velocity",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Electric current",
  "explanation": "Current doesn't follow vector addition and decomposition law,so it is not a vector.Current density is a vector quantity. Electric current I = q/t. As both charge and time are scalars, therefore electric current is a scalar quantity."
