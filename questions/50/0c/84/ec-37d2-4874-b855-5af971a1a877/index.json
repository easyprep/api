  "answer": "1, 2 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nProject Sahara was launched by IAS officer Arun Mahesh Babu in Gujarat. It seeks to reduce the maternal mortality rate and consequently, the infant mortality rate. The project has seen tremendous success, especially with the use of NASG. Some of the reasons for the project are the widespread occurrence of anaemia among mothers, long distance travelled by rural women to reach hospitals, poor nutrition, etc.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nPPH is the leading cause of maternal mortality. It is accompanied by sepsis and hypertensive disorders at the top spots. PPH is the severe and sudden blood loss that accompanies child delivery. It accounts for 35% of maternal deaths globally. It is also a fast killer- within 4 to 24 hours of parturition. Secondary PPH can also occur between 24 hours to 12 weeks post-delivery. However, PPH is easily preventable.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe project uses a specialised garment called the Non-Pneumatic Anti-Shock Garment. It pressures the blood accumulating in the pelvic region and forces it to vital organs when worn on the abdominal and lower body region. It is made of neoprene polymer and is sourced from Hong Kong for the project. 40 PHCs in Ahmedabad are equipped with NASG- each of which can be used upto 140 times.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakaram entitles pregnant women to also avail free caesarean section service in government facilities. It is a 2011 initiative of the centre and all the states and UTs have implemented it. It also provides other free services for mothers like free transport from home to hospital (and vice versa), free blood, free diet, medications, etc. The NASGs were procured under this scheme."
