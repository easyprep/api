  "question": "With regards to the recent discussion about alternate meat like ‘Impossible Pork’ and ‘Impossible Sausage’, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It can be made from plant substitutes.</li>\n<li>Leghemoglobin, a component used for alternative meat production, is derived from yeast.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nAlternate meat can be prepared from plant based substitutes. Earlier, they were being grown in lab from animal cells. The technology has now been developed to manufacture these ‘mock meats’ from materials like jackfruit, soy, mushrooms, yeast, rice, coconut oil, cocoa butter, etc.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nAlternate meat manufacturing makes use of heme- which is an iron containing protein responsible for the meaty texture of traditional meats. The alternate meat industry derives this protein from plant sources like soy roots. The heme is produced from a soy protein called leghemoglobin."
