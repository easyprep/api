  "explanation": "Persian literature associates the works and poems of the famous poet \"Hafez\". Khwaja Shams-ud-Din Mu?ammad ?afe?-e Shirazi, known by his pen name Hafez, was a Persian poet, whose collected works are regarded by many Iranians as a pinnacle of Persian literature. His works are often found in the homes of people in the Persian-speaking world, who learn his poems by heart and still use them as proverbs and sayings. His life and poems have become the subjects of much analysis, commentary and interpretation, influencing post-14th century Persian writing more than any other author.",
