  "question": "Which of the following is true about an ideal gas, if Cp =molar specific heat capacities at constant pressure, Cp= molar specific heat capacities at constant volume and R is the universal gas constant?",
  "option1": "Cp + Cv = R",
  "option2": "Cp/ Cv = R",
  "option3": "Cp – Cv = R",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Cp – Cv = R",
  "explanation": "For an ideal gas, the molar specific heat capacities at constant pressure and volume satisfy the relation Cp – Cv = R, where R is the universal gas constant."
