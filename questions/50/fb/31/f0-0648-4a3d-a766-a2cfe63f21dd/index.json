They were inclined to lay greater emphasis on the informal processes of politics and less on political institutions in isolation. Wallas sought to introduce a new realism in political studies in the light of new findings of contemporary psychology whereas Bentley, provide for new tools for investigation to undertake a study of the roles of pressure groups, political parties, elections and public opinion in the political process."
