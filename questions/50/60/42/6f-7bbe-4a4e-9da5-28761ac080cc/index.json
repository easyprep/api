  "question": "Consider the following statements about Preamble: <ol> <li>Preamble is non-justiciable in nature</li> <li>Preamble has been sourced from United States Constitution</li> <li>Preamble cannot be amended</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",

  "option3": "3 Only",
  "option4": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 & 2 Only",
  "explanation": "Third statement is incorrect because preamble can be amended, subject to the condition that no amendment is done to the 'basic features&rsquo;. The Preamble has been amended only once so far, in 1976, by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act, which has added three new words-Socialist, Secular and Integrity-to the Preamble."
