  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "There was an essential difference between the Hindu gods of the Vedic age and the Greek gods of the Homeric age. The Hindu conceptions go nearer to the original Nature-worship of the primitive Aryans, even as the Sanskrit language is nearer and closer than the Greek to the original Aryan tongue. Among the Greeks of the Homeric age, the gods and goddesses have already attained a marked individuality ; their history, their character, their deeds, engage our attention ; their connection with the powers and manifestations of Nature almost escapes us. The Hindu gods of the Vedic age, on the contrary, are obviously still Natureâ€™s powers and manifestations ; they have scarcely any other character or history. We can more clearly identify Dyu with the sky than Zeus, and Ahand and Dahand are more obviously and manifestly the Dawn than Athena and Daphne. The Hindu conceptions are more ancient, more archaic, more true to their original sources. The Greek conceptions are more developed, and have passed farther from the domain of Nature-worship to that of Polytheism. (RC Datt)"
