  "option3": "Malaysia",
  "option4": "Cambodia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Indonesia",
  "explanation": "Indonesia forms the habitat of critically endangered species such as \"Sumatran orangutan\", \"Bali myna\", and \"Javan rhinoceros\". The Sumatran orangutan is one of the three species of orangutans. Found only in the north of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, it is rarer than the Bornean orangutan but more common than the recently identified Tapanuli orangutan, also found in Sumatra. The Bali myna is a medium-sized (up to 25 centimetres (9.8 in) long), stocky myna, almost wholly white with a long, drooping crest, and black tips on the wings and tail. The bird has blue bare skin around the eyes, greyish legs and a yellow bill. Both sexes are similar. It is critically endangered and fewer than 100 adults are assumed to currently exist in the wild. The Javan rhinoceros, also known as the Sunda rhinoceros or lesser one-horned rhinoceros, is a very rare member of the family Rhinocerotidae and one of five extant rhinoceroses.",
