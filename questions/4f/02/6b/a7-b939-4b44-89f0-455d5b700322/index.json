  "question": "What is the relationship between becquerel and curie unit?",
  "option1": "1 curie = 0.5 Bq",
  "option2": "1 curie = 9 × 10<sup>6</sup> Bq",
  "option3": "1 curie = 3.7 × 10<sup>10</sup> Bq",
  "option4": "1 curie = 5.7 Bq",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 curie = 3.7 × 10<sup>10</sup> Bq",
  "explanation": "1 curie = 1 Ci = 3.7 × 10<sup>10</sup> decays per second = 3.7 × 10<sup>10</sup> Bq. This is approximately the amount of radioactivity emitted by one gram (1 g) of radium-226. The 'curie' unit is named after Pierre Curie, a French physicist."
