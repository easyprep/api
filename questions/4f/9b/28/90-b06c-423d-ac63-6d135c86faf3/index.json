  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1, 3, 4 & 5",
  "explanation": "Period of general economic decline, defined usually as a contraction in the GDP for six months (two consecutive quarters) or longer. Marked by high unemployment, stagnant wages, and fall in retail sales, a recession generally does not last longer than one year and is much milder than a depression. Although recessions are considered a normal part of a capitalist economy, there is no unanimity of economists on its causes. A credit boom is driven by a rapid expansion of credit to the private sector accompanied by rising asset prices."
