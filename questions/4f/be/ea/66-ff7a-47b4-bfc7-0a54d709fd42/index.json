  "explanation": "Russia has recently dismissed the findings of the long-awaited report by US Special Counsel Robert Mueller and said that it failed to present any evidence of Russian meddling in the 2016 US elections.  The report titled “Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election” details extensive contacts between Donald Trump\\'s 2016 campaign and Russian operatives who, it said, sought to tilt the election in Trump\\'s favor. It is the product of a 22-month investigation by Robert Mueller. He was appointed to probe Russian interference in the 2016 elections and possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. The 448-page report did not find evidence of a criminal conspiracy between Trump\\'s 2016 election campaign and Russia."
