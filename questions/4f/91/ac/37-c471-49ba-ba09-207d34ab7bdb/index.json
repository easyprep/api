  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe Great Knot is a wader bird found near aquatic habitats like lakes and beaches. It is a migratory bird that breeds in Siberia but winters in the southern countries in Asia and even Australia. The Great Knot was recently spotted at the Chilika Lake after 5 years.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:       </strong>\r\nThe Great Knot bird is listed as an endangered species by the IUCN. They are the largest of their genus. The annual bird count at the Chilika Lake recorded over a million migratory birds this year (2020). This is being linked to the dismantling of illegal prawn farms in the region."
