  "question": "With respect to Nigeria’s progress against wild poliovirus, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Wild poliovirus is endemic to India and Pakistan.</li>\n<li>Oral polio vaccine can cause poliomyelitis.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe wild poliovirus is endemic to only 2 countries in the world: Pakistan and Afghanistan. The number of cases in the former has been increasing while it’s decreasing in the latter. Elimination of the virus in these countries is required for complete eradication of the virus as its presence anywhere implies that it’s transmitted to other countries too.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe poliovirus causes poliomyelitis disease especially among children under 5. The disease has no cure and is prevented using vaccines. While inactivated vaccine is safe, the oral polio vaccine may cause up to 3 cases of vaccine-derived paralytic poliomyelitis out of 1 million cases."
