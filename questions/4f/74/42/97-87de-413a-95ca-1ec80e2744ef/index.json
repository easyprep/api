This entire process is done in a laboratory. In this process the eggs are taken from the mother\\'s ovary and fertilised by the sperms from the father. <br />Then the fertilized eggs are cultured for two to six days and allowed to be divided two to four times inside a test tube, thus the name test tube baby. These eggs are then implanted back into the uterus of a mother where it can develop normally. This is done with the sole intention for establishing and ensuring a successful pregnancy."
