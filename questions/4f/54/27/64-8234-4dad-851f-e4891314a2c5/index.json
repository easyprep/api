  "option3": "Tamil Nadu",
  "option4": "Maharashtra",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Maharashtra",
  "explanation": "The Maharashtra government recently ordered the destruction of ‘Thai Magur’ fish breeding centres because of the threat posed to native fishes and the unhygienic conditions. Thai Magur is a type of catfish. It is also known as the exotic African Catfish. The fish species is known to survive in even poor conditions like wet mud and sludge. It is also reported to be unhealthy for human consumption. Thai Magur is not a native species of India. It is an invasive species from Africa. It is carnivorous and known for feeding on native fish species and decimating their populations. Studies reported that 70% of drop in native fish species’ population is because of these Magurs. The National Green Tribunal had banned the farming of Thai Magur in 2000. The central government had banned the transportation, breeding and sale of the invasive species the same year. However, the species continue to be cultivated for their adaptability, taste and high growth rates."
