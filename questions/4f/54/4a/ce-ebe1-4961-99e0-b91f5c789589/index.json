  "question": "Consider the following statements:<br> 1. The first sign of an El Ni√±o is a rise in air pressure over the Indian Ocean, Indonesia, and Australia<br> 2. ENSO is connected with worldwide fishing problems<br> Which among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The first sign of an EI Nino is a rise in air pressure over the Indian Ocean, Indonesia, and Australia. Because El Nino events cause changes or reverses in air pressure in the eastern and western Pacific, the trade winds that normally carry warm waters away from South America&#8217;s Pacific coast toward Australia fail to do so. The warmer waters evaporate more easily causing larger amounts of clouds, and thus rainfall. Air pressure can tell us a lot about the weather. With a high-pressure system, there are cooler temperatures and sunny skies. When a low-pressure system moves in, look for warmer temperatures and thunderstorms. ENSO is connected with worldwide fishing problems. Temperature-dependent fish species increase or decrease according to biological requirements. Fish populations (e.g., Peruvian sardines, shrimp) normally sustained on the nutrient-rich cold waters move southward to colder Chilean waters."
