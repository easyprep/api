  "option4": "Only 1 & 3 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Ecozones</strong> Ecozones are the Biogeographic division of the Earth’s land surface, based on distributional patterns of terrestrial organisms. This means that they include ONLY terrestrial part of the Biosphere and that is why they are alternatively called “Terrestrial Ecozones”. Further, Ecozones are defined by genetic, taxonomic, or Geological similarities, rather than the Morphology, plant structures, leaf types, plant spacing or climates. Then, an Ecozone can include a number of different biomes. They both are groups of ecosystems."
