  "option1": "(i) & (ii)",
  "option2": "(i), (ii) & (iii)",
  "option3": "(i), (ii) & (iv)",
  "option4": "(i) only",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "(i) only",
  "explanation": "Theory of relativity- Albert Einstein<br />• Quantum theory- Modern quantum mechanics was born in 1925 when the German physicists Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Pascual Jordan developed matrix mechanics and the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrodinger invented wave mechanics.<br />• Radio activity - The discovery of radioactivity took place over several years beginning with the discovery of x-rays in 1895 by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen.<br />• Rocket propulsion - Dr. Robert Hutchings Goddard is considered the father of modern rocket propulsion."
