As glaciers retreat, they leave behind large hills of debris known as Moraines. A U-shaped valley or glacial trough is formed by the process of glaciation. Examples of U-valleys are found in mountainous region like the Alps, Himalaya, Rocky mountains, Scottish Highlands, Scandinavia, New Zealand and Canada.
