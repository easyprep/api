  "option4": "Pune",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Bengaluru",
  "explanation": "Bengaluru has become the India’s first city where one can have fuel delivered at one\\'s doorstep just like milk and newspapers. Mypetrolpump, a one-year-old startup, has conducted a soft launch with three delivery vehicles - each with a capacity of 950 litres. It has already delivered more than 5,000 litres of diesel. Diesel is delivered at the day\\'s running price with a fixed delivery charge. For up to 100 litres, the one-time delivery charge is Rs 99. Above 100 litres, one needs to pay the diesel price plus one additional rupee per litre. The startup has got 20 odd customers, including 16 schools (which have 250-300 buses) and a few apartments. One can place orders online, through a phone call or by downloading the free app."
