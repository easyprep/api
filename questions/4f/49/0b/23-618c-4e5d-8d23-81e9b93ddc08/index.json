  "option2": "Agriculture",

  "answer": "Agriculture",
  "explanation": "The Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India defines and specifies allocation of powers and functions between Union &amp; States. It contains three lists; i.e. 1) Union List, 2) State List and 3) Concurrent List.<br />Agriculture is a state subject, i.e. it forms a part of the state list of our Constitution, which essentially means that states are supposed to address all the issues related to agriculture. Over the years, agriculture, being a state subject, has been viewed as a road-block for implementation of reforms."
