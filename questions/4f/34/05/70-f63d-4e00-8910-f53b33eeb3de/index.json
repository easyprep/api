  "explanation": "The World Post Day (WPD) is observed every year on 9 October to mark the anniversary of the establishment of the Universal Postal Union in 1874 in the Swiss Capital, Bern. It was declared World Post Day at the 1969 UPU Congress in Tokyo, Japan. The proposal was submitted by Anand Mohan Narula, a member of the Indian delegation. Since then, the day has been celebrated all over the world to highlight the importance of the postal services. The 2018 theme is: \\\"Imagine you are a letter travelling through time. What message do you wish to convey to your readers?\\\". This year’s observance of World Post Day highlights the sector’s value not just for delivering the mail, but for delivering good."
