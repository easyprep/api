  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "Alternative assets are non-traditional assets with potential economic value that is not found in a standard investment portfolio. Typically, these investments provide returns that have a low or negative correlation with traditional assets like equity and debt. They help increase returns and diversify risk. Some exotic investments like in yachts, rare stamps, fine wine or rare coins also fall under alternative asset category. Typically, alternative assets are illiquid and hence investment is recommended with a time frame of more than five years. Poor liquidity makes it difficult to determine the true value of the investment in many cases. Due to the high risk involved, return expectations are also high"
