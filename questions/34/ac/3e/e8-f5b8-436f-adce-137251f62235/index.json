  "answer": "Intas",
  "explanation": "Drug-maker Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd has become the first company to launch Romiplostim in India under the brand name Romy for the treatment of chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP). ITP is an autoimmune blood disorder which leads to low platelet counts. The newly-launched drug will cost just one-fifth of the price of the current medication. It is estimated that around 42,000 patients are diagnosed with ITP in India every year. Less than 10% of patients have access to the treatment, which is required to maintain adequate platelet counts for a longer duration."
