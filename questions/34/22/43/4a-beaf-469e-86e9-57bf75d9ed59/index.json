  "question": "A seismic&nbsp;shadow zone&nbsp;is an area of the&nbsp;Earth&#039;s surface where: <ol> <li>seismographs cannot detect an&nbsp;earthquake &nbsp;</li> <li>neither the P-waves nor the S-waves reach the surface</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Both are correct statements<br> The shadow zone is an area on the earth&rsquo;s surface in between 104 degrees to 140 degrees from the epicentre where neither the primary waves nor the secondary waves reach the surface. The L-waves, which are surface waves, reach the shadow zone in some cases, but are so weak, that it becomes almost impossible to detect them. The P-waves fail to reach this area due to deflection and the S-waves are absorbed in the interior of the earth."
