  "question": "Consider the following: <ol> <li>Black&nbsp;carbon</li> <li>Carbon monoxide</li> <li>Tropospheric&nbsp;ozone</li> <li>Hydrofluorocarbons&nbsp;(HFCs)</li> <li>Methane</li> </ol> Which of the above are Short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs)?",
  "option1": "Only 1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option2": "Only 2, 3, 4 & 5",
  "option3": "Only 1, 3, 4 & 5",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3, 4 & 5",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1, 3, 4 & 5",
  "explanation": "Short lived Climate Pollutants (SLCPs) include black carbon, methane, hydro fluorocarbons (HFCs) and ground level ozone. Although they have a shorter residence time in the atmosphere than CO2, but their reduction from atmosphere can help to reduce Global warming. Carbon monoxide is not included under the category of Short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs).&nbsp;"
