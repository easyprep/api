  "question": "&nbsp; Consider the following statements about the Coriolis Effect: <ol> <li>The effect increases with increase in latitude</li> <li>The effect is an artifact of the&nbsp;earth&#039;s rotation</li> </ol> &nbsp; &nbsp; Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct because Coriolis Effect&nbsp;is zero at equator and maximum at poles. Second statement is also correct because Coriolis Effect is an artifact of the earth&rsquo;s rotation, due to which the winds in northern hemisphere get deflected towards right, while in southern hemisphere winds get deflected towards left. The effect is also proportional to wind speed; that is, deflection increases as wind strengthens. The Coriolis force explains why winds circulate around high and low pressure systems as opposed to blowing in the direction of the pressure gradient. Central idea behind the Coriolis force is that when the earth rotates from west to east, it produces the centrifugal force and due to this force, there is a change in the direction of the wind.&nbsp;"
