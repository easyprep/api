  "option1": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "All are incorrect",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Central Board of Direct Taxes has setup a startup cell for grievance redressal. It is composed of 5 members. It will address issues in relation to the angel tax. Recently startups have been exempt from angel tax which is imposed on angel investors. It is a tax imposed on a private firm when the funds raised by it is above its fair valuation.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe startup cell will deal with issues in relation to the administration of Income Tax Act, 1961. Recently the inapplicability of section 56(2)(viib) of Income Tax Act to startups was declared by the finance ministry. The section was introduced into the act to curb use of unaccounted money.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nStartups in India enjoy a 3 years tax holiday in a 7 years block. An eligible startup does not have to pay tax on profits for 3 years if its turnover doesnâ€™t exceed 25 crore INR per year. This is to aid the startups to establish itself during the initial stages when capital scarcity is a common problem."
