  "question": "With reference to the recent discoveries about the ancient civilisation in Rakhigarhi, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Rakhigarhi is a World Heritage Site.</li>\n<li>Rakhigarhi is the largest Harappan site.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nRakhigarhi in Haryana is yet to be declared a World Heritage site. The title eludes the site because of the encroachment plaguing the region. Only 15% of the identified land is protected. UNESCO norms call for lack of encroachment and a clear core area for declaration as a world heritage site.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nRakhigarhi is the largest Harappan site in the world. It is spread over an area of 550 acres. However, only a small portion is protected under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958. Several human skeletons have been unearthed from the region."
