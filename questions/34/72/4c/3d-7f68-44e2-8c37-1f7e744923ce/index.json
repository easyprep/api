  "option1": "Centrifugation",
  "option2": "dialysis",
  "option3": "reverse osmosis",
  "option4": "diffusion",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Centrifugation",
  "explanation": "The principle behind the spinning dry of the clothes in a washing machine is centrifugal force. The fast spinning around of the clothes in the drum creates a large centrifugal force from center to the edge of the drum, and the wet clothes are flung outwards to the drum edge and the water escapes through the drum holes."
