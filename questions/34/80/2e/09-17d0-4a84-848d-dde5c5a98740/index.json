  "question": "In light of Chandrayaan-II findings when passing through the geotail, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Geotail is formed due to the interactions between the Earth and the moon.</li>\n<li>Chandrayaan-II will traverse the geotail region only once during its life.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nGeotail is a region that is formed due to interaction between the Sun and the Earth. It is a region that allows the best of observations to take place. It is formed due to interaction of the solar wind plasma and the earthâ€™s magnetic field. It is on the side of earth facing away from the sun where the protective envelop stretches beyond the lunar orbit like a tail.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nChandrayaan-II will be able to traverse the geotail region every 29 days. Each time, the satellite will be in the protective envelope for a period of 6 days. The instruments on-board the orbiter will study the various aspects while in the geotail region."
