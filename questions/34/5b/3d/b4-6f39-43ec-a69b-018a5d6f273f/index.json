  "option1": "Belgium",
  "option2": "Zimbabwe",
  "option3": "Spain",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Zimbabwe",
  "explanation": "The International Cricket Council (ICC) has suspended Zimbabwe Cricket with immediate effect over violation of global body\\'s constitution which doesn\\'t allow any government intervention. Zimbabwe Cricket was found to have been in breach of Article 2.4 (c) and (d) of the ICC Constitution for failing to provide a process for free and democratic elections and to ensure that there is no government interference in its governance and/or administration for cricket respectively. As a consequence of suspension, Zimbabwe Cricket will no longer receive funding from the ICC and its representative teams are now ineligible from competing in any ICC events. The ICC has directed that the elected Zimbabwe Cricket Board be reinstated to the office within three months and progress in this respect will be considered again at the October Board meeting. The Croatia Cricket Federation and the Zambia Cricket Union have both also been suspended for continuing non-compliance with ICC Membership criteria. The Moroccan Royal Cricket Federation has also been expelled from Membership of the ICC."
