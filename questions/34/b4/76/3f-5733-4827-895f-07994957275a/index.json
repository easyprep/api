  "explanation": "The major cause of anemia is iron deficiency. It can occur due to thalassemia (inherited disorders of hemoglobin) also. Anemia is a condition that develops when your blood lacks enough healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin. Iron deficiency is thought to be the most common cause of anemia globally, although other conditions, such as folate, vitamin B12 and vitamin A deficiencies, chronic inflammation, parasitic infections, and inherited disorders can all cause anemia."
