  "explanation": "The Parliament of Lebanon recently made the cannabis farming done for medicinal use, legal. This decision has been made to increase the export of the medicinal products made from the plant and thereby developing the agricultural sector.\r\nThis step is expected to increase the revenue of the Government, amidst the prevalent coronavirus pandemic, as the countryâ€™s economy is paralyzed with financial crisis. Earlier, about 25 tonnes of a particular drug made from cannabis were ceased, which were hidden for smuggling."
