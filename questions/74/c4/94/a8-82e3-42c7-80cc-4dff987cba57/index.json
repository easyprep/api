  "question": "With reference to the reports of unusual activity by the Sagittarius A*, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is an elliptical galaxy.</li>\n<li>It is being consumed by the S2 blackhole.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Sagittarius A* is a supermassive blackhole which is located near the centre of the Milky Way galaxy. It is about 26,000 light years away from earth. Supermassive blackholes are the largest among the blackholes caused by gravitational collapse of celestial objects.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe blackhole is in the process of consuming the star S2 or S0-2. Blackholes do not emit original light. But since the star is being consumed by it, the Sagittrius A* has been glowing brightly and being observed by the astronomers.\n&nbsp;"
