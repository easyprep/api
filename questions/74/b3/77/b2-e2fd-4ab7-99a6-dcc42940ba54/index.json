  "answer": "Adlis",
  "explanation": "Muhammad Bin Tughlaqâ€™s rule is significant for the introduction of token currency. He understood the importance of currency as a medium of commercial exchange and that is why he took keen interest to circulate gold and silver coins. He enlarged the gold dinar from 172 grains to 202 grains. He introduced a silver coin, the adlis, which was discontinued after seven years due to lack of popularity and acceptance among his subjects."
