  "question": "The International Astronomical Union (IAU) considers an object to be a dwarf planet if:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It orbits a star</li>\r\n<li>It has enough mass for its gravity to overcome external forces to acquire a near-spherical shape</li>\r\n<li>It doesn’t have bigger objects in its neighbourhood</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "(1) A planet is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. (2) A “dwarf planet” is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, (c) has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit, and (d) is not a satellite. (3) All other objects, except satellites, orbiting the Sun shall be referred to collectively as “Small Solar System Bodies.”"
