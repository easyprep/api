  "question": "Gandhi's fast in which jail led to the Poona Pact on 20 September 1932?",
  "option1": "Pune Jail",
  "option2": "Bombay Jail",
  "option3": "Yerwada Jail",
  "option4": "Nagpur Jail",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Yerwada Jail",
  "explanation": "BR Ambedkar strongly supported the Award for the Depressed Classes, but Gandhi went on an indefinite fast from 20 September 1932 against the same at the Yerwada jail on the grounds that it would disintegrate Hindu society; and was effectively an attack on the Indian unity and nationalism. Treatment of depressed classes as a separate political entity would lead to the untouchables remaining untouchables in perpetuity, and the question of abolishing untouchability would get undermined. Many leader such as Rajaji, Rajendra Prasad, Madan Mohan Malaviya, Rabindranath Tagore, Tej Bahadur Sapru sprung into action against the prevailing untouchability. A call was given to open temples to the untouchables; and an ‘Untouchability Abolition League’ was formed. Finally, a negotiation between Gandhi and Dr BR Ambedkar happened as the Poona Pact—on 24 September 1932 to have a single Hindu electorate, with Untouchables having seats reserved within it. The Poona Pact was accepted by the British Government as an amendment to the Communal Award."
