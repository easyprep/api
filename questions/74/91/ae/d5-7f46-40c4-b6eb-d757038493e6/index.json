  "answer": "USA",
  "explanation": "The U.S. House of Representatives on December 3, 2019 overwhelmingly approved a bill that would require the Trump administration to toughen its response to China\\'s crackdown on its Muslim minority, demanding sanctions on senior Chinese officials and export bans. The purpose of the bill is to address gross violations of universally recognized human rights, including the mass internment of over 1,000,000 Uighurs. It also accuses China of systematically discriminating against Uighurs by denying them a range of civil and political rights, including the freedoms of expression, religion, movement and a fair trial."
