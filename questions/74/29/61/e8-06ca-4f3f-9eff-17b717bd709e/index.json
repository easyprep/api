  "option1": "Only 1",

  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "<strong>Sucrose is the sweetest of all naturally occurring carbohydrates</strong> This is incorrect. Correct sugar would be fructose. <strong>Acetylene is the basic chemical building block of natural rubber</strong> This is incorrect. The purified form of natural rubber is the chemical polyisoprene, which can also be produced synthetically. Natural rubber is used extensively in many applications and products, as is synthetic rubber. It is normally very stretchy and flexible and extremely waterproof."
