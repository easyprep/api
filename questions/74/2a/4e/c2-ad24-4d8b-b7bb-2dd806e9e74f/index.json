  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Overcoming the challenges posed by the August deluge, heat-waves and other environmental effects, some environmentalists and local people have incubated and released 226 hatchlings of endangered Olive ridley turtle to sea at Thottappally Coast,Â  near Allapuzha, Kerala. Being vital location of egg-laying turtles, this shift has been done due to stray dogs, mineral sand mining along with erosion near the harbour <strong>(2 and 3)</strong>. Although a proposal was made for a permanent hatchery submitted to the government, the project is yet to get the nod. Environmentalists have warned the move to extract mineral sand from the estuary area."
