  "question": "With reference to Parliamentary terminology, how \"closure\" is different from \"Guillotine\"?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>While Closure ends a debate, Guillotine ends a session</li>\r\n<li>While Closure is preceded by a motion, Guillotine is not preceded by a motion</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "Closure is one of the means by which a debate may be brought to a close by a majority decision of the House, even though all Members wishing to speak have not done so. Guillotine refers to putting by the Speaker of outstanding question or questions relating to the business in hand on expiry of the time allotted for its discussion. Unlike closure, the guillotine to be applied is not preceded by any motion. On the last of the allotted days at the appointed time, the Speaker puts every question necessary to dispose of all the outstanding matters in connection with the demands for grants. The guillotine concludes the discussion on demands for grants."
