  "answer": "1960 – 1996",
  "explanation": "The Guatemalan Civil War was a civil war in Guatemala fought from 1960 to 1996 between the government of Guatemala and various leftist rebel groups. These were supported by ethnic Maya indigenous peoples and Ladino peasants, who together make up the rural poor. The government forces have been condemned for committing genocide against the Maya population of Guatemala during the civil war and for widespread human rights violations against civilians. The context of the struggle was based on longstanding issues of unfair land distribution; European-descended residents and foreign companies, such as the American United Fruit Company, had dominated with control over much of the land, conflicting with the rural poor.",
