  "question": "In light of discovery of the Matryoshka Diamond, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>This diamond has inclusions of gold.</li>\n<li>Diamonds are formed in the cratonic region of lithosphere.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",

  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Matryoshka Diamond is also known as the nesting-doll diamond. It consists of a smaller diamond inside a larger diamond. The smaller diamond moves around in the larger diamondâ€™s cavity. This diamond was discovered in the Yakutia mines in Russia.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe cratonic part of the lithosphere is where diamonds are formed. It is an ancient portion of Earth that is stiff mantle. They help buoy the overlying continental landmasses. The diamonds are carbon allotropes formed under extreme pressure and heat."
