  "question": "Which of the following is used to increase the voltage of alternative current?",
  "option1": "Capacitor",
  "option2": "Transformer",
  "option3": "Inverter",
  "option4": "Rectifier",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Transformer",
  "explanation": "A major advantage of alternating current is that its voltage can be modified relatively easily using a transformer, which allows power to be transmitted at very high voltages before being taken down to safer voltages for commercial and residential use."
