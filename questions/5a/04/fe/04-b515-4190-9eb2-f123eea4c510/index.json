  "question": "Which among the following characteristics of soil is/are correctly matched?<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Permeability - The volume of water which can be held within a soil.</li>\r\n<li>Porosity - The ease with which liquids/gases can pass through rocks or a layer of soil.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Permeability – The ease with which liquids/gases can pass through rocks or a layer of soil is called permeability. It depends on the size, shape and packing of particles. It is usually greatest in sandy soils and poor in clayey soils.<br />Porosity – The volume of water which can be held within a soil is called its porosity. It is expressed as a ratio of volume of voids (pores) to the total volume of the material."
