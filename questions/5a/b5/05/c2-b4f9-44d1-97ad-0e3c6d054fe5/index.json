  "question": "Consider the following statements: \r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Oxygen as well as most Carbon dioxide are transported by Red Blood cells </li>\r\n<li>Iron is required for transportation of Oxygen as well as Carbon Dioxide </li>\r\n<li>Both Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide bind with Hemoglobin </li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements are correct ?",
  "option1": "1 & 2",
  "option2": "2 & 3",
  "option3": "1 & 3",
  "option4": "3 only",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "3 only",
  "explanation": "Statement 1 is incorrect because Oxygen is transported by Red blood cells but Carbon Dioxide is transported as bicarbonate ion and by plasma.\r\nStatement 2 is incorrect because Iron is a component of Hemoglobin and the 98.5% of Oxygen binds to Hemoglobin, only some part of Carbon Dioxide binds with hemoglobin which makes carbamino compounds.\r\nThird statement is correct."
