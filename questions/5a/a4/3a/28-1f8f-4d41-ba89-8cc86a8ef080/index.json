  "question": "With reference to the recent reports connecting geological processes to climate change by the Deep Carbon Observatory, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The DECADE program studies the contribution of degassing to climate change.</li>\n<li>India is a member of the DCO program.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nDECADE is a sub-program of the DCO. It stands for Deep Earth Carbon Degassing. It deals with the study of degassing’s contribution. Degassing is the process of release of gases into the atmosphere from rocks, ices, etc. Degassing can occur through fractures or faults in volcanically active areas like volcanic lakes, mid-ocean ridges, etc.\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nIndia is a part of the DCO program. It is a global research program involving about 47 countries and over 900 scientists. In India, the Deccan Trap region is of particular interest to this program. The study in India is focused around the microbial forms under the Deccan Trap region and the Koyna drilling site.\n&nbsp;"
