  "question": "Which of the following is incorrect about the Inter atomic and Intermolecular Forces?",
  "option1": "Both the forces are electrical in origin",
  "option2": "Both the forces are active over short distances",
  "option3": "General shape of force-distance graph is similar for both the forces",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of the above",
  "explanation": "Comparison between Inter atomic and Intermolecular Forces: (i) Both Inter atomic and Intermolecular forces are electrical in origin. (ii) Both Inter atomic and Intermolecular forces are active over short distances. (iii) General shape of force-distance graph for both the forces is similar. (iv) Both the forces are attractive up to certain distance between atoms/molecules and become repulsive when the distance between them becomes less than that value."
