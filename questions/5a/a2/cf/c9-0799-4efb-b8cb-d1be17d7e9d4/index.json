  "question": "Consider the following statements:<br> 1. The magnesium deficiency of soil can be cured by using Epsom Salt<br> 2. Zinc is used to coat iron sheets to prevent them from rusting<br> 3. Most of the ink erasers contain oxalic acid<br> 4. In jet planes, a concentrated solution of hydrogen peroxide is used as a ready source of oxygen for burning the fuel.<br> Which among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "option3": "Only 1, 3 & 4",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "Epsom salt is magnesium sulfate and is used to correct magnesium deficiency in soil. Zinc is used to coat iron sheets to prevent them from rusting. This process of coating iron sheets with molten zinc is called galvanizing. Galvanized iron sheets are used for roofing and for making tubes, buckets, etc. Third statement is also correct. A hydrogen peroxide-powered motor is based on the decomposition reaction of hydrogen peroxide. Nearly pure (90% in the Bell Rocket Belt) hydrogen peroxide is used. Pure hydrogen peroxide is relatively stable, but in contact with a catalyst (for example, silver) it decomposes into a mixture of superheated steam and oxygen in less than 1/10 millisecond, increasing in volume 5000 times."
