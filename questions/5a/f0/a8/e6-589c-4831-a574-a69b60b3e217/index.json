  "question": "On a half-moon night, what is the angle between the moon and the sun when measured from earth?",
  "option1": "45°",
  "option2": "60°",
  "option3": "90°",
  "option4": "180°",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "90°",
  "explanation": "At 90° angular separation from the Sun, you on the Earth see half of the Moon\\'s illuminated side and half of its night side. The phase is called a quarter phase because you can see a quarter of the Moon\\'s entire surface (and 90 degrees is one-quarter of 360 degrees)."
