  "answer": "Europe",
  "explanation": "Three Baltic countries in the northern Europe: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania initiated the re-connection measure named as ‘travel bubble’.\r\nThe European Union countries started this to make their economies back to form, after the post-Covid lock downs. They are also less- populated and comparatively less affected by Covid-19. The travel bubble would allow members of the group to renew trade ties with each other and restart travel and tourism sector."
