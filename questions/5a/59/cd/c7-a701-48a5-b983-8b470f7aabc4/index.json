  "answer": "2 & 4",
  "explanation": "The annual session of the Congress parties as well as Muslim League were held in Lucknow in 1916. Separately they passed the same resolution, which we know as “Lucknow Pact”. Via this:<br />• Congress accepted the provision of Separate Electorate for Muslims, given through Indian Council Act of 1909. This was earlier opposed by the Congress.<br />• For Provincial Legislative Assembly, seats for Muslims was to be reserved. The Muslim leaders accepted under representation in Muslim-majority areas (for instance 40% of seats in Bengal, though the Muslim population in Bengal was 52%) in return for over-representation in provinces like Bombay or United Provinces (30%). It is clear that the UP-based Muslim politicians dominated in the League. One-third elected seats of Central Legislative Assembly were reserved for Muslims, whose members had to come through separate electorate.<br />• If 3/ 4th members of any community in a Legislative Assembly objects on any Resolution on the ground that it is against their interests, it would not be passed.<br />• More autonomy to the provinces in financial matters.<br />• 80% members of both central and provincial Legislative Assembly should be elected.<br />• Half of the strength at least, of central and provincial Executive body shall come from elected Legislative body.<br />• Except army and External Affairs, the Legislative Council should have control over all departments.<br />• India should be treated as ‘Dominion Status country’."
