  "explanation": "The Age of Consent Act, 1891 was an amendment of the Indian Penal Code for certain subjects. It was introduced as a bill on 9 January 1891. It increased the age of a girl victim of sexual assault from ten to twelve. Any such kind of molestation below the age of twelve would be considered as a sexual assault. Tilak opposed the bill by saying \"We would not like that the government should have anything to do with regulating our social customs or ways of living, even supposing that the act of government will be a very beneficial and suitable measure\"."
