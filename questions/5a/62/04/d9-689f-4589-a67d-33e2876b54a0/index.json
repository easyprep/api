  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Fiscal consolidation refers to steps taken by government to reduce the spending and check Fiscal deficit.\r\n<strong>RBI increasing Repo Rate</strong>\r\nThis is correct because RBI increasing Repo rate will curb the commercial banks lending and contribute to fiscal consolidation.\r\n<strong>Increasing SLR</strong>\r\nThis is correct because increase in SLR will again curb the commercial banks lending capacity and contribute to fiscal consolidation.\r\n<strong>Startup India</strong>\r\nThis is incorrect because Start-up India programme is leading to fiscal stimulus in economy and this is opposite to what fiscal consolidation would mean to.\r\nIssue\r\n<strong>Issuing Government Bonds and T-Bills</strong>\r\nThis is incorrect because government borrowing in bonds and T-bills will increase government\\'s liability and hence no fiscal consolidation."
