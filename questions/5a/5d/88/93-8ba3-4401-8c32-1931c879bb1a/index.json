  "answer": "Russia, Turkey, Georgia",
  "explanation": "Russia, Turkey, Georgia are the three countries that represent the ancient pre-Hellenistic \"Colchis\" geographical site. In pre-Hellenistic Greco-Roman geography, Colchis located on the coast of the Black Sea, centered in present-day western Georgia. It has been described in modern scholarship as \"the earliest Georgian formation\", which, along with the Kingdom of Iberia, would later contribute significantly to the development of the Kingdom of Georgia and the Georgian nation. Colchis is known in Greek mythology as the destination of the Argonauts, as well as the home to Medea and the Golden Fleece. It was also described as a land rich with gold, iron, timber and honey that would export its resources mostly to ancient Hellenic city-states."
