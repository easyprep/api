  "option1": "Only 1",

  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "On the basis of size of particles, the terrigenous deposits may be categorised into three classesâ€” <br />mud, sand and gravel. <br />Mud refers to the finest particles which comprise the minute particles of rock forming minerals, principally quartz. Murray has classified the mud deposits into blue, green and red types, based on the colour of constituents. <br />Sand refers to the coarser particles, while gravel has even bigger particles."
