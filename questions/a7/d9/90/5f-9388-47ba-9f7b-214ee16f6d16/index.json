  "explanation": "The 4th South-Asian Speaker’s Summit  was recently held in Male, Maldives. The summit was meant to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) but Pakistan tried to raise the issue of abrogation of Article 370 provisions on Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) despite not being part of the agenda. The Indian delegation in the summit was represented by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, Harivansh Narayan Singh.  Though, India maintained that J&K is an internal matter. The summit adopted the Male Declaration & ignored Pakistan\\'s concern on Kashmir."
