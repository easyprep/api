  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "1 & 3 Only",
  "option3": "3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 & 2 Only",
  "explanation": "First and second statements are correct. Third statement is incorrect because seaweed farming in India is very poor; in fact, it is confined to limited parts of Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands. Though India is bestowed with a coastline of more than 17,000 km, it has not taken up seaweed cultivation interestingly. Asia stands as the world leader in seaweed cultivation and more than 80% is contributed by China, Korea and Japan. Only recently, seaweed cultivation is picking up in certain coastal districts of the Tamil Nadu state. Seaweeds are rich in minerals, vitamins, trace elements and bioactive substances, and therefore, seaweeds are called medical food of the 21st century."
