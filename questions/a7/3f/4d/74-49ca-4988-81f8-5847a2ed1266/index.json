  "question": "In which rocks does most of the formation of caves take place?",
  "option1": "Granite",
  "option2": "Quartzite",
  "option3": "Limestone",
  "option4": "Sandstone",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Limestone",
  "explanation": "Karst topography is a result of the dissolution of soluble rocks like limestone, dolomite and gypsum. <br />Caves are formed due to weathering of rock deep underground. Cave or cavern is a natural void and is  a space large enough so that a human can enter. The study of the formation and development of caves is called as Speleogenesis. Most of the formation of caves takes place in limestone rocks by dissolution."
