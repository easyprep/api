  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Irrawaddy Dolphin is a euryhaline aquatic mammal. This means that the animal is able to adapt to a wide range of salinities in the water. The dolphins are found in Myanmar’s Irrawaddy River and also in Indonesia’s Mahakam River and Mekong River. They can live in lakes, rivers and coasts.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:       </strong>\nThe Irrawaddy Dolphin is an endangered species. 146 of these dolphins were recently recorded in Odisha’s Chilika Lake. This makes it the single largest lagoon population of these dolphins. Illegal prawn culturing infrastructure and unsustainable tourist boating are major threats to these animals."
