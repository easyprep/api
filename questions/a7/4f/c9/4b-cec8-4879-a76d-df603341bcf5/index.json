  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The Government of India no longer issued any instruction to Provincial Governments and each provincial Government was allowed to develop local self governing institutions according to provincial needs and requirements. It led to the transfer of public health, sanitation, and vital statistics to the provinces. This was first step in the decentralization of health administration in India."
