  "question": "With reference various peasantsâ€™ movements in British India, there were significant differences between the revolts of 19th century and 20th century. Consider the following statements with this respect:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The peasants of 19th century were not aware of their legal rights, while the peasants of 20th century were aware of them</li>\r\n<li>The peasants of 19th century generally lacked nationalist feelings, while the peasants of 20th century were aware of their nationalist duties</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "The first statement is not correct because if we carefully study the revolts we find that the peasants were aware of their legal rights in the 19th century. Legal course of action was taken along with violence, protest etc. in 19th century. However, in 20th century, this awareness increased more and more.<br />The second statement is correct because peasant movement of early nationalist era lacked understanding of colonial economic structure and the colonial state. The peasants of twentieth century were fully aware of their nationalist duties."
