  "question": "What is the energy consumption per tonne of steel produced in the integrated steel plants in India ?",
  "option1": "4.5 Giga Calorie per tonne",
  "option2": "3.5 Giga Calorie per tonne",
  "option3": "5 Giga Calorie per tonne",
  "option4": "6.5 Giga Calorie per tonne",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "6.5 Giga Calorie per tonne",
  "explanation": "The Energy consumption in the integrated steel plants in India is 6.5 Giga Calorie per tonne of crude steel. It is high as compared to 4.5-5.0 in steel plants abroad. The higher rate of energy consumption is mainly due to obsolete technologies including problems in retrofitting modern technologies in old plants, old shop floor &amp; operating practices, poor quality of raw material viz. high ash coal/coke, high alumina iron ore etc."
