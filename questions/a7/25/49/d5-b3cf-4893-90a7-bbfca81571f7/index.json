  "answer": "C. Wright Mills",
  "explanation": "C. Wright Mills presented a new version of the elite theory in his famous work<em> The Power Elite.</em> He preferred the term 'power elite' to 'ruling class'. While Marxian concept of the 'ruling class' implied that an economic class would exercise all political power in society, Mill's concept of 'power elite' implied a combination of several groups who exercised all political power by virtue of their high status in all important spheres of social life."
