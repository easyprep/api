  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The&nbsp;urea&nbsp;production occurs at liver, then is transported to kidney, at last, excreted as urine. The&nbsp;urea is produced&nbsp;from ammonia and carbon dioxide. Insulin&nbsp;is released from the beta cells in your&nbsp;pancreas&nbsp;in response to rising glucose in your bloodstream. After you eat a meal, any carbohydrates you&#039;ve eaten are broken down into glucose and passed into the bloodstream.&nbsp;"
