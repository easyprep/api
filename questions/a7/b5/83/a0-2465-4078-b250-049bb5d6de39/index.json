  "question": "Which of the following was not a leap year?",
  "option1": 1896,
  "option2": 1900,
  "option3": 1904,
  "option4": 1908,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 1900,
  "explanation": "To compensate for this discrepancy, the leap year is omitted three times every four hundred years. In other words, a century year cannot be a leap year unless it is divisible by 400. Thus 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years, but 1600, 2000, and 2400 are leap years."
