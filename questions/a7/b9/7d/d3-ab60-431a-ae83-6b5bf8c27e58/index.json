  "option3": "Hegemony of the Color",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Hegemony of the Color",
  "explanation": "According to Frantz Fanon, whites make them realize that they are inferior and whites are superior. Blacks then internalize this racism as a personal failure leading to an inferiority complex. According to Fanon, this racism is continuously reinforced in the society reminding the black people that they are black first and people second. This hegemony of the color is the reason why Blacks always try to become whites."
