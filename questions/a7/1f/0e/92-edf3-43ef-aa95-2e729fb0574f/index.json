  "question": "Which among the following example is a right combination?",
  "option1": "Marble : Metamorphic Rock",
  "option2": "Basalt : Intrusive Igneous Rock",
  "option3": "Slate : Extrusive Igneous Rock",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Marble : Metamorphic Rock",
  "explanation": "When the molten magma cools, it becomes solid. Rocks thus formed are called igneous rocks. They are also called primary rocks. There are two types of igneous rocks: intrusive rocks and extrusive rocks\r\nLava is actually fiery red molten magma coming out from the interior of the earth on its surface. When this molten lava comes on the earth’s surface, it rapidly cools down and becomes solid. Rocks formed in such a way on the crust are called extrusive igneous rocks. They have a very fine grained structure. For example, basalt. The Deccan plateau is made up of basalt rocks. Sometimes the molten magma cools down deep inside the earth’s crust. Solid rocks so formed are called intrusive igneous rocks. Since they cool down slowly they form large grains. Granite is an example of such a rock"
