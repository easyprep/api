  "explanation": "The first statement is obviously correct. The Samaj regards the Vedas as infallible, eternal and divine. The second statement is also correct. The Samaj, to prevent child marriage, fixed the minimum marriageable age at 25 years for boys and 16 for girls. Inter-caste marriage and widow remarriage were encouraged. Third statement is also correct. Arya Samaj has been a pioneer for education of all. Arya Samaj promotes both Vedic religious and secular education for boys, girls and adults. Fourth statement is also correct albeit, it does not allow Muslims, Jews, Christians etc. marriages unless they conform to their so called Shuddhi rituals and convert to Hinduism."
