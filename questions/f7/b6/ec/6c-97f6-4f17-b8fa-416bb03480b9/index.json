  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Almost all of Indiaâ€™s rivers are of open basin as more than 90% of total surface water runoff would go to Bay of Bengal. Rest goes to Arabian Sea. There is just a small area in parts of Ladakh, northern parts of the Aravalli range and the arid parts of the Thar Desert, that have inland drainage."
