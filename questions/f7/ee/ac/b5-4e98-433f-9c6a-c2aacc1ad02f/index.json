  "question": "Which of the following will turn blue litmus red?",
  "option1": "Dry Hydrogen Chloride",
  "option2": "Aqueous solution of Hydrochloric acid",
  "option3": "Aqueous solution of Ammonia",
  "option4": "Brine",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Aqueous solution of Hydrochloric acid",
  "explanation": "Dry HCl does not form ions but HCl is aqueous solution of hydrogen chloride gas which gives H+ and Clâ€“ ions and shows acidic property and turns blue litmus red. Aqueous solution of Ammonia gives OH- ions and is basic in nature. Brine indicates a highly concentrated solution of sodium chloride, which comes from a strong acid (HCl) & a strong base (NaOH) through a neutralization reaction. Its pH is close to 7."
