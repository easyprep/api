  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 and 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2",
  "explanation": "The order of coming of Europeans in India is Portuguese-Dutch-English-French. French Company was the last amongst the European Trading powers to reach India. (Hence Statement 1. is correct) The “cartazes” licensing system was created in 1502 to control and enforce the Portuguese trade monopoly over a wide area in the Indian Ocean, taking advantage of local commerce. Officially, no vessel was permitted to sail in the Indian coast without this document, risking losing their cargo, being attacked and even sunk by the Portuguese – mainly Muslim, Hindu and Malay merchant ships. Every year, during the monsoon, Portuguese fleets patrolled the coasts requiring this document. (Hence Statement 2. is correct)"
