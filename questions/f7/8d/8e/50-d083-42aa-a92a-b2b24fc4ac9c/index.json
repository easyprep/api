  "answer": "3 only",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Charter is a non-binding agreement. It was initiated by the European Space Agency and the French Space Agency and came into existence in 2000. It provides for humanitarian transfer of satellite data among the member countries upon activation of the charter by a member under disaster conditions. Till date, it has been invoked more than 600 times.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nCyclone Fani occurred in May and India activated the charter provisions to receive data from foreign satellites. The 600<sup>th</sup> activation was in March- a milestone in the charter’s utilisation- during the Indonesian floods. The flash flood and landslide in Indonesia had killed about 112 people and injured many more.\n<strong>Statement 3</strong> is correct:\nThe charter can be invoked by UN agencies also. The charter has an agreement with UN bodies UNOOSA and UNOSAT. UNOOSA is UN office for outer space affairs and UNOSAT is a project of UN institute for training and research that provides satellite imagery, analysis and capacity building services to UN members and partners."
