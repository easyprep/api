  "question": "Consider the following statements with respect to Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015: <ol> <li>Under the act, a minor who is above 16, if accused of committing any crime, will be tried as an adult during assessment</li> <li>The juvenile justice board has a mandatory provision for a women member in the board</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because the act asks for treatment of a juvenile as adult only when committing a ‘heinous crime’, which is defined as an offence that attracts at least a jail term of seven years or more under Indian Penal Code. Second statement is correct. The act says that the board shall consist of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of First Class with minimum three years of experience, and the board must have a female member. &nbsp;"
