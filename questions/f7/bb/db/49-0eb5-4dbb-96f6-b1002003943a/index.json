  "question": "In context with the threats posed by upside-down lakes highlighted by recent studies, the Pine Island Glacier was mentioned. With reference to this, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Pine Island Glacier is located in the East Antarctica region.</li>\n<li>It is claimed by USA.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nPine Island Glacier is located in the West Antarctica region. It constitutes 10% of the West Antarctica Ice Sheet. It is the fastest melting glacier of the continent and constitutes 25% of the ice loss from Antarctica. Recent studies show that fast flowing ice like those in the Pine Island are more prone to forming upside-down rivers.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:    </strong>\nThe Pine Island Glacier is claimed by no country. It is under the protection of the Antarctic Treaty. The treaty prohibits any claims on regions under its protection. While military activity is banned here, the scientific research can be carried out."
