  "question": "Which country has successfully tested its first cutting-edge waverider hypersonic aircraft \"Starry Sky-2\"?",
  "option1": "China",
  "option2": "Japan",
  "option3": "Russia",
  "option4": "United States",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "China",
  "explanation": "On August 5, China has successfully tested its first cutting-edge waverider hypersonic aircraft \\\"Xingkong-2 (or Starry Sky-2)\\\" which could carry nuclear warheads and penetrate any current generation anti-missile defense systems. This type of waverider aircraft uses shock waves generated by its own flight as a lifting surface to enhance the lift-to-drag ratio to reach the hypersonic regime of Mach 5 or even above. It flew independently, made large-angle turning maneuvers, and landed in the targeted area as planned. It travels at least 4 times faster than the speed of sound.  The aircraft was designed by the China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics (CAAA) in collaboration with the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASTC). Presently, the United States and Russia have been carrying out similar experiments."
