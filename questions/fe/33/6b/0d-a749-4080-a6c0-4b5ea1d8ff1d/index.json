It has been imposed in Maharashtra for 6 months due to inability of political parties to form a government after 2019 assembly election.The Assembly will be kept under suspended animation.The President\\'s Rule can be revoked before the 6-month period if a situation emerges for formation of a stable government, If political parties fail to form a government within 6 months, Maharashtra will have to go for another election. However, this is the 3rd instance when President\\'s Rule has been imposed in the 59-year-old history of the state. The present-day Maharashtra came into existence on 1st May 1960."
