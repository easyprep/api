Group A, Group B and Group C</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct. The Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) was introduced under Foreign Trade Policy of India (FTP 2015-20). The scheme aims to provide reward to exporters in the form of Duty Credit Scrips. Second statement is correct. Under this scheme, destination countries have been classified into three categories viz. Group A, Group B and Group C. Earlier there were five different schemes with different Duty Credit Scrips. All these were merged into a single scheme called Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) with one Duty Credit Scrip. This scheme has done well so far to offset infrastructural inefficiencies and the associated costs of exporting products produced in India and boost export from the country."
