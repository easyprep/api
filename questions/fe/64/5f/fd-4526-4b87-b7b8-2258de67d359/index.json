  "answer": "Draw neighbour area water",
  "explanation": "Well irrigation is the simplest, cheapest, and independent source of irrigation and can be used as and when the necessity arises. It is more reliable during periods of drought when surface water dries up.<br />Tubewells can draw a lot of groundwater from its neighboring areas and make the ground dry and unfit for agriculture.
