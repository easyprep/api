His followers were pledged to nonviolence, and they derived their popular title from the red colour of their shirts.<br />The Khudai Khidmatgar was founded on a belief in the power of Gandhi’s notion of Satyagraha. The volunteers of Khudai Khidmatgar movement were also known as “Surkho Posh” or “Red shirts”. It was initially a social reform organization focusing on education and the elimination of blood feuds from Afghan society but turned more political later. The main aim was to throw Britishers out of India."
