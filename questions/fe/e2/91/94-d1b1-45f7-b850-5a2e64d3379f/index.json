  "option4": "Persian Renaissance",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Persian Renaissance",
  "explanation": "Persian Renaissance is also known as the \"Iranian Intermezzo\". The term Iranian Intermezzo or Persian Renaissance represents a period in history that saw the rise of various native Iranian Muslim dynasties in the Iranian Plateau after the 7th-century Muslim conquest of Iran and the fall of the Sasanian Empire. The term is noteworthy since it was an interlude between the decline of Abbasid rule and power by Arabs and the \"Sunni Revival\" with the 11th-century emergence of the Seljuq Turks. The Iranian revival consisted of Iranian support based on Iranian territory and most significantly a revived Iranian national spirit and culture in an Islamic form. The Iranian dynasties and entities which comprise the Iranian Intermezzo are the Tahirids, Saffarids, Sajids, Samanids, Ziyarids, Buyids and Sallarids.",
