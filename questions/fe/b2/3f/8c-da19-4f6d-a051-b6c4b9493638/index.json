  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Prorogation is one of two ways in which the President, using powers conferred upon him by Art 85 of the Constitution, may terminate a session of Parliament. [The second way is by Dissolution, which ends the life of Lok Sabha and brings on an election.] When the House is prorogued, all pending notices, motions and resolutions lapse, but Bills — as per Article 107(3) — don’t."
