  "question": "What do you understand by Milankovitch cycles?",
  "option1": "Shifts in the temperature of surface water in the middle latitudes of the Pacific Ocean",
  "option2": "Changes in Earth's rotation and orbit around the sun that may trigger climate variation",
  "option3": "Phenomena that describe the timing of the northern lights in the thermosphere",
  "option4": "Transpiration, evaporation, and precipitation of Earth's water",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Changes in Earth's rotation and orbit around the sun that may trigger climate variation",
  "explanation": "Astronomer Milutin Milankovitch developed the mathematical formulae upon which these orbital variations are based. He hypothesised that when some parts of the cyclic variations are combined and occur at the same time, they are responsible for major changes to the earth’s climate (even ice ages). A 1976 study, published in the journal ‘Science’ examined deepsea sediment cores and found that Milankovich’s theory corresponded to periods of climate change. Indeed, ice ages had occurred when the earth was going through different stages of orbital variation."
