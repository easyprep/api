  "explanation": "Denmark, Germany, Netherlands are the three countries that share the location of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Wadden Sea\". The Wadden Sea is the largest unbroken system of intertidal sand and mudflats in the world, with natural processes undisturbed throughout most of the area. This World Heritage property encompasses a multitude of transitional zones between land, the sea and freshwater environment, and is rich in species specially adapted to the demanding environmental conditions. It is considered one of the most important areas for migratory birds in the world and is connected to a network of other key sites for migratory birds. Its importance is not only in the context of the East Atlantic Flyway but also in the critical role it plays in the conservation of African-Eurasian migratory waterbirds. In the Wadden Sea, up to 6.1 million birds can be present at the same time, and an average of 10-12 million passes through it each year."
