  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Right to be Forgotten is one of the provision of EU’s General Data Protection Regulation law. It is applicable only within the borders of the EU member countries. This right allows individuals to get organisations like Google to delete their personal data. The issue was in news when a German murderer won the right against Google in November.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe B N Srikrishna Committee had recommended the introduction of the right to be forgotten as a part of the draft personal data protection bill of 2018. The bill proposed that the data principal have a right to prevent the data fiduciary from using personal data in certain cases like irrelevancy."
