  "question": "Which among the following is / are correct statements?<br> 1. The images produced by Concave Mirrors are always real images<br> 2. The images produced by Flat Mirrors are always virtual images<br> 3. Converging Lens can produce virtual as well as real images<br> Select the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option4": "Only 2 & 3 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3 are correct",
  "explanation": "Real images can be produced by concave mirrors and converging lenses. But a converging lens and concave mirror are also capable of producing virtual images if the object is within the focal length. Thus statement 1 is incorrect, while statement 3 is correct. Flat mirrors can never produce real image because, rays never really converge, so statement 2 is correct."
