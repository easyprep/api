  "option2": "Greece and North Macedonia",
  "option3": "Greece and Bulgaria",
  "option4": "Greece and Serbia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Greece and Albania",
  "explanation": "The Pindus is a mountain range located in northern Greece and southern Albania. It is roughly 160 km long, with a maximum elevation of 2,637m (Mount Smolikas). Because it runs along the border of Thessaly and Epirus, the Pindus range is known colloquially as the \"spine of Greece\". The mountain range stretches from near the Greek-Albanian border in Northern Epirus, entering the Epirus and Macedonia regions in northern Greece down to the north of the Peloponnese. Geologically it is an extension of the Dinaric Alps, which dominate the western region of the Balkan Peninsula.",
