  "question": "Consider the following diseases:<br> 1. Encephalitis<br> 2. Meningitis<br> 3. Pneumonia<br> Which among the above can be caused by Bacteria, Virus as well as Fungi?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "<strong>Encephalitis and Meningitis</strong> Viral encephalitis can be caused by rabies virus, Herpes simplex, poliovirus, measles virus, and JC virus. Bacterial encephalitis can be caused by certain bacteria. Similarly, a fungus called Cryptococcus neoformans causes Fungal encephelitis. Similarly, Meningitis can also be Viral, Bacterial or Fungal. <strong>Pneumonia</strong> Bacteria are the most common cause of community acquired pneumonia, with Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated in nearly 50% of cases, yet in adults, viruses account for approximately a third of pneumonia cases. Commonly implicated agents include: rhinoviruses,coronaviruses, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus etc. Fungi may also cause Pneumonia. Usually it may occur in individuals with weakened immune systems due to AIDS, immunosuppressive drugs, or other medical problems. Fungal pneumonia is most often caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, blastomyces, Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis jiroveci, and Coccidioides immitis.Further, some parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, and Ascariasis also may lead to Pneumonia."
