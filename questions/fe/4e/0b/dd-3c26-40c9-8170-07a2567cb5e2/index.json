  "option1": "White oak",
  "option2": "Rhododendron",
  "option3": "Chir Pine",
  "option4": "Teak",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Chir Pine",
  "explanation": "Chir pine is the correct answer. Chir pine is one of the most useful tree species in the Himalayan region. It is mainly used as a timber and fuel wood. The Chir pine itself is highly resistant to fire due to thick bark but the fallen dry needles are highly inflammable and its open resin ducts are considered a main catalyst for fires in pine forests."
