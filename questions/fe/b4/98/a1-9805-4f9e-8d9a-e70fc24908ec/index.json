  "option5": "",
  "answer": "It absorbs all the colours",
  "explanation": "Actually a black board has all colours in light or white light . So when light falls on it board absorbs all colours because all are present so no light is reflected back . That is the case when board has all colours and so it will appear black as it absorbs all colours of light that fall on it ."
