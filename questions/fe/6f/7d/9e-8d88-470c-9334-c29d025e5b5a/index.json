  "question": "Consider the following landforms: <ol> <li>Pot holes</li> <li>Plunge pools</li> <li>Rapids</li> </ol> Which of the above is/are formed due to Aeolian action?",
  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "3 Only",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "None",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None",
  "explanation": "Pot holes are small holes or ditches or scars formed on the bottom of a valley caused by the heavier stones that move tumbling down under the force of running water. Plunge pools are formed due to thrust of falling water and rock debris at the foot of a waterfall a hole or deep depression is formed. This depression is called a plunge hole. Rapids&nbsp;are sections of a&nbsp;river&nbsp;where the&nbsp;river&nbsp;bed has a relatively steep gradient, causing an increase in water velocity and turbulence. Thus, we see that all of the above mentioned landforms are result of fluvial action and not by Aeolian action."
