  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nDogor was unearthed from Siberia’s melting permafrost. With the increase in the average global temperature, more and more such remains are being revealed from the permafrost- like the steppe bison, rhinoceros and ponies. Siberian landscape constitutes 20% of the Russian terrain.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nDogor is a pup- either of a dog or wolf like animal. It is about 18,000 years old. Since it was preserved in the permafrost, the remains were mostly intact. It had intact head, skeletons, teeth, fur, whiskers, lashes etc."
