  "question": "Which of the following comparisons of Himalayan Rivers and Peninsular Rivers is / are correct?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>While the rivers of the Himalayan region carry a large amount of silt, those of the peninsular region carry a very limited amount of sediment</li>\r\n<li>While the rivers of the Himalayan region are perennial, those of the peninsular region are seasonal</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "• The rivers of the Himalayan region rise in the glaciers and they are perennial. In summer their volume tends to increase because snow melt in the upper reaches.<br />• The peninsular rivers do not have their sources in glaciers and most of them are rainfed.<br />• The Himalayan rivers not only carry a larger volume of water in comparison to their peninsular counterparts but also carry a larger amount of silt. On the other hand the peninsular region rivers carry a very limited amount of sediment.<br />• The slopes of the Himalayan rivers is very steep on the upper reaches. That is one reason that they erode and transport huge amounts of sediments. Further, the landforms over these rivers flow is also young.<br />• On the other hand, the peninsular rivers have not very steep gradient and they flow on already eroded old topography.<br />• Further, the hard rocks of the peninsular region are not as susceptible to erosion as those of the Himalayan region."
