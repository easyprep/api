  "question": "With regards to the recently introduced ‘Ethnic Unity Law’, consider the following statements about Tibetan Autonomous region:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is the largest provincial level division in China.</li>\n<li>The ethnic minorities constitute less than half of its population.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",

  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Tibetan Autonomous region is considered as a provincial level division of China. It is the second largest such division of China after Xinjiang. It was established in 1965 after Tibet was incorporated into China in 1951. Its capital is Lhasa.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:   </strong>\n95% of the population in the region is composed of ethnic minorities. The ‘Ethnic Unity Law’ was passed recently to assert that Tibet has been an inalienable part of China since historic times. It imposes that the ethnic minorities have a duty to take a stand against separatism."
