  "question": "Consider the following statements The purpose of adding sodium sulphate and sodium silicate to the detergent in a washing powder is<br />1. To keep the washing powder dry<br />2. To maintain the alkalinity of the powder<br />Which of these statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 and 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2",
  "explanation": "The addition of silicates to synthetic detergents has proved very beneficial. Silicates soften water by the formation of precipitates that can be easily rinsed away. Soluble silicates contribute to detergents as cleaning aids, processing aids, and corrosion inhibitors. As cleaning aids, soluble silicates provide alkalinity and promote soil suspension. Sodium sulphate is simply a filler in detergent powder, in much the same way as fillers are used in many medical tablets, it doesn\\'t play any active role as such."
