  "explanation": "The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Swedish aerospace and defence company (Saab)  to explore Air Traffic Management (ATM) solutions for airports operating under the UDAN  regional connectivity scheme. In the sector of ATM solutions, Saab has a portfolio ranging from Advanced-Surface Movement Guidance & Control System (A-SMGCS) and Surface Movement Radar (SR- 3), to Remote Towers which can be deployed at all types of airports. ATM solutions from Saab can support both single and multiple runway airfields, as well as remote operations and deployable systems. Hence, the MoU with Saab will support AAI’s need for ATM solutions and training of its personnel in ATM services. The MoU highlights the efforts of AAI to build infrastructure for the Indian government’s UDAN-RCS regional airport development and regional connectivity plan, helping to make air travel more affordable and widespread."
