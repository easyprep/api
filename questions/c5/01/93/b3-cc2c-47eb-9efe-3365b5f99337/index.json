  "question": "In recent times, MRI Scan and Computer Tomography (CT) scan have become two very popular technologies for diagnosis of various ailments. How these technologies are different from each other?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>While MRI technology uses X-rays for producing cross sectional, Computed tomography uses RF pulse.</li>\r\n<li>While Computed tomography is able to image bone, soft tissue and blood vessels all at the same time, MRI can be used only for soft tissues.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 Only",
  "explanation": "First statement is incorrect because MRI technology uses radio pulse for imaging whereas Computed tomography uses X rays for imaging. Beside this, MRI is more costly and is used only for soft tissues, whereas CT scan can be used for bone, soft tissues and blood vessels. Though MRI is costly when compared to CT scan, but CT scan possess risk of ionization radiation, which is not in case of MRI."
