  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nNPPA was constituted in 1997 as a pharmaceutical price regulatory agency. It falls under the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers. It is responsible for identification of drug shortages, monitoring availability and also take steps to address the situation. With reference to the AVR shortage, the NPPA has been holding stakeholdersâ€™ consultation to deal with the supply-demand mismatch.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nIndia produces more doses of AVR than annually required. The annual demand stands at around 48 million doses. The production per year is about 50 million doses. However, most of the vaccine is exported. The health ministry has asked the producers to prioritise domestic supply over exports.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nThe country suffers a high burden of Rabies deaths. Nearly 36% of Rabies deaths in the world occurs in India. Most of the rabies cases are caused by stray dog attacks (96% of the cases). This has caused about 21,000 deaths per year."
