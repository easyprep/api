  "explanation": "It was recently announced that India is set to use Euro-VI emission compliant fuels from April 1, 2020. It is the world\\'s cleanest petrol and diesel, which has a sulphur content of just 10 parts per million.\r\nAt present, India uses Euro-IV equivalent emission compliant fuels (Bharat Stage â€“ IV), and in just 3 years, it has shifted to BS-VI fuel. It took seven years to switch from the third stage to fourth stage. Several states and UTs have already shifted to BS-VI grade fuels including Delhi and Haryana."
