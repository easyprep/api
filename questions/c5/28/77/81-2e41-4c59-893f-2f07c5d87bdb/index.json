  "answer": "Russia",
  "explanation": "Russian state-run atomic energy corporation Rosatom has successfully tested the world’s first Floating Nuclear Power Plant (FNPP) – Akademik Lomonosov. The FNPP has a capacity of 70MW and is equipped with two reactors of 35MW each. It has an operational life span is 40 years, with the possibility of being extended up to 50 years. According to Rosatom, in the second half of 2019, the FNPP will be transported to its final destination to the port of Pevek in Russia\\'s extreme north-eastern region of Chukotka, where it will replace the Bilibino Nuclear Power Plant and the Chaunskaya coal-fired power plant.  An FNPP is basically a mobile, low-capacity reactor unit operable in remote areas isolated from the main power distribution system, or in places hard to access by land. They are designed to maintain both uninterruptible power and plentiful desalinated water supply in remote areas."
