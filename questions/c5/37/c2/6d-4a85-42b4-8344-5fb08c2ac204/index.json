  "question": "India will tie up with which of the following countries to develop a pollution-forecast system?",
  "option1": "Japan and Australia",
  "option2": "Sweden and United Kingdom",
  "option3": "South Africa and Brazil",
  "option4": "United States and Finland",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "United States and Finland",
  "explanation": "The Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) is tying up with the United States and Finland to develop a pollution-forecast system that will help anticipate particulate matter (PM) levels at least two days in advance and at a greater resolution than what is possible now. Currently, the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), run out of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, serves as the apex forecaster of pollution trends in Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Ahmedabad. It generates a likely air quality profile, a day in advance, for these cities. IITM is an organisation under the MoES. The new system, to be jointly developed with expertise from the Finnish Meteorological Institute and the U.S.â€™ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, will use a different modelling approach as well as computational techniques from that employed in the SAFAR model."
