  "question": "The \"Cross-Sanaga-Bioko Coastal Forests\" spans which countries?",
  "option1": "Nigeria, Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea",
  "option2": "Niger, Chad and Ethiopia",
  "option3": "Chile, Peru and Ecuador",
  "option4": "Indonesia, Malaysia and Timor-Leste",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Nigeria, Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea",
  "explanation": "The Cross-Sanaga-Bioko Coastal Forests ecoregion comprises the lowland and coastal forests of southeastern Nigeria, southwestern Cameroon, and the lowlands of the island of Bioko. The flora includes high numbers of endemic genera, indicating a long history of forest cover. These forests contain some of the highest rates of animal species richness of any African forest, especially in terms of forest-restricted mammals, birds and butterflies. Many of these animals are endemic to this ecoregion or to the continuous Atlantic Coastal Forests Ecoregion, but others are found more widely across the Congo Basin. The ecoregion is heavily impacted by human use, including logging and plantation agriculture."
