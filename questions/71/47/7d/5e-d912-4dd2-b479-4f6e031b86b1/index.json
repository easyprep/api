  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about the troposphere?<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The temperature in this layer decreases with the increase in height</li>\n<li>The greater fall in the temperature is above the equator</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Troposphere is the lowermost layer of the earth's atmosphere. The height of troposphere is about 18 km on the equator and 8 km on the poles. The temperature in this layer falls at the rate of 5 degrees per kilometre. It reaches -45 degree celsius at the poles and -80 degree celsius at the equator.Â  The greater fall in temperature above equator is because of the greater thickness of troposphere is 18 km."
