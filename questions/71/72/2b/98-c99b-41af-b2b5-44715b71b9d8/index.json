  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",

The existing lines along the route are not to be used. The railway ministry and the state government are implementing the project on a cost sharing basis.\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Silver Line project is to come up in Kerala. It is to connect Thrissur and Thiruvananthapuram which are at the state’s corners. Major towns and districts are to be connected by semi high speed trains with their own dedicated tracks."
