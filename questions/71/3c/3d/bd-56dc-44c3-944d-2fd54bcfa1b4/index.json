  "answer": "Alauddin Khilji",
  "explanation": "Alauddin Khilji, the muslim ruler, enforced price control system for the first time. The primary reason of controlling the market by Alauddin was not to reduce the salary of his soldiers but to check the rising prices of different articles in terms of inflation. Alauddin did not fix the prices of the different articles lower than the prevalent prices of those articles in places around Delhi. Besides, the prices fixed by Alauddin were not very different from what we find then afterwards during the reign of Firoz Shah Tughlaq."
