  "question": "What do we call the wave if the constituents of the medium oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation?",
  "option1": "Transverse wave",
  "option2": "Longitudinal wave",
  "option3": "Electromagnetic wave",
  "option4": "Matter wave",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Transverse wave",
  "explanation": "If the constituents of the medium oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, we call the wave a transverse wave. If they oscillate along the direction of wave propagation, we call the wave a longitudinal wave"
