  "question": "Which one of the following sets is correctly matched?",
  "option1": "Diphtheria, Pneumonia and Leprosy : Hereditary",
  "option2": "AIDS, Syphilis and Gonorrhoea : Bacterial",
  "option3": "Colour blindness, Hemophilia and Sickle cell anaemia : Sex linked",
  "option4": "Polio, Japanese B encephalitis and plague : Viral",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Colour blindness, Hemophilia and Sickle cell anaemia : Sex linked",
  "explanation": "• If you are colorblind, you have difficulty distinguishing certain colors, such as blue and yellow or red and green. Color blindness is an inherited condition that affects males more frequently than females<br />• Hemophilia A and hemophilia B are inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The genes associated with these conditions are located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder.<br />• Sickle cell anemia is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition. This means that the gene can be passed on from a parent carrying it to male and female children."
