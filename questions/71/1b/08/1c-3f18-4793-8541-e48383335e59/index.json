  "question": "In reference to the recent discussions about reintroducing cheetah in India, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The Asiatic Cheetah is extinct in India.</li>\n<li>India is to introduce the Asiatic Cheetah into the selected sites.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Asiatic Cheetah is extinct in India. It was declared so in 1952 officially. The last known Asiatic Cheetah in India was killed by Maharaja Ramanuj Pratap Singh of Chhattisgarh. The Asiatic Cheetah is now found in parts of Iran. It is however listed as a critically endangered species.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nIndia is to introduce the African Cheetah from Namibia to repopulate suitable sites. The move was decided after the Supreme Court allowed it based on a plea by the National Tiger Conservation Authority. The two sub-species- Asiatic and African cheetahs are barely different from each other in terms of physical appearance."
