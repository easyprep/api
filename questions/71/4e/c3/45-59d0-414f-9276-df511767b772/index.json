  "question": "Consider the following observations about the provisions of Grant-in-aid in India:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The Article 275 of the Constitution of India provides that every state of India shall be allocated grants-in-aid</li>\r\n<li>The allocation of grants-in-aid has to be uniformly distributed as per a ratio of the population / Income of the concerned state</li>\r\n<li>The role of Finance Commission is to ensure that the grants-in-aid reaches every state as per the provisions of the Constitution of India</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is/ are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "None of them",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of them",
  "explanation": "The first statement is incorrect because article 275 does not say that every state of India is to be assigned some grant in aid. The basic rule is to have a system of Grants-in-aid to the “needy states”. The grants-in-aids are to be given out of the consolidated fund of India and the amount is fixed by the Finance Commission, using whatever formula it takes as a feasible formula. This means that some states can be kept out of grant-in-aids. Thus statement 2 is also incorrect, there is no need of uniform distribution.\r\nThe statement 3 also mention that “grants-in-aid reaches every state as per the provisions of the Constitution of India” is incorrect."
