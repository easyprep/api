  "explanation": "Uruguay will become the first country in the world to fully allow the production, sale and consumption of marijuana when its pharmacies will be allowed to sell marijuana in July 2017. It adopted a revolutionary law that fully legalized production, sale and consumption of marijuana. Under the law, buyers must sign up for a national registry of marijuana users to ensure they have fulfilled licensing procedures and do not exceed the monthly maximum purchase of 40 grams (1.4 ounces). Under the law, users also have the option to grow their own pot at home, or join cannabis clubs that grow it in cooperatives."
