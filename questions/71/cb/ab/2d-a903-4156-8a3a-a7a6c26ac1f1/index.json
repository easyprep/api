  "question": "With respect to September 29<sup>th</sup> being observed as the World Heart Day, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Air pollution can cause cardiovascular diseases.</li>\n<li>Increased exposure to air pollution increases the level of oxy-haemoglobin.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nAir pollution has been listed as the causative of cardiovascular disease. It is being termed as the new tobacco. A recent study found that 35% of CVD patients without any conventional risk factor contracted the disease due to air pollution.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe increased exposure to air pollution increase the carboxy-haemoglobin level of blood. This is a risk factor. This is especially observed in vehicle drivers. Carboxy-haemoglobin is formed when haemoglobin in the blood reacts with carbon monoxide, which is an air pollutant."
