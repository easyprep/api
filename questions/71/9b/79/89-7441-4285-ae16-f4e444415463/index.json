  "question": "Which one of the following is secreted by Pancreas and regulates the amount of sugar in the body?",
  "option1": "Renin",
  "option2": "Creatin",
  "option3": "Vitamin",
  "option4": "Insulin",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Insulin",
  "explanation": "Insulin and glucagon are hormones secreted by islet cells within the pancreas. They are both secreted in response to blood sugar levels, but in opposite fashion. Insulin is normally secreted by the beta cells of the pancreas. Glucagon raises blood glucose levels by stimulating the liver to metabolize glycogen into glucose molecules and to release glucose into the blood.<strong>  </strong>Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels."
