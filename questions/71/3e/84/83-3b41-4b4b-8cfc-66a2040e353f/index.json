  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nA person whose parent/ grandparent has ever been a citizen of Bangladesh is not eligible to become an OCI cardholder. The same is also applicable to a person with similar links to Pakistan. This is in accordance with the section 7A of the OCI Card Rules.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:    </strong>\nAn OCI card holder enjoys the same benefits as a PIO card holder because these two had been merged in 2015. There only the OCI category at present. An OCI can become an Indian citizen after holding the status for 5 years."
