  "explanation": "• Gandhi launched a March known as the Dandi March against the unjust laws of the British government. Therefore, on April 6, 1930, Gandhi formally launched the Civil Disobedience Movement. The main objective of the Civil Disobedience movement is that the people wanted to break the unjust laws such as the salt tax law.<br />• Home Rule League was established in April and September 1916 respectively by Indian nationalist Bal Gangadhar Tilak and British social reformer and Indian independence leader Annie Besant.<br />• The moderate leaders were A.O. Hume, W.C. Banerjee, Surendra Nath Banerjee, Dadabhai Naoroji, Feroze Shah Mehta, Gopalakrishna Gokhale, Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, Badruddin Tyabji, Justice Ranade, G.Subramanya Aiyar etc.<br />• Brahmo Samaj was theistic movement within Hinduism. It was founded in Calcutta in 1828 by Raja Ram Mohan Roy."
