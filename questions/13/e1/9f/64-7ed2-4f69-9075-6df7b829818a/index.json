  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Iran",
  "explanation": "Iran banned the teaching of English in primary schools after Islamic leaders warned that learning the language opened the way to a Western 'cultural invasion'. Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei teachers that it does not mean opposition to learning a foreign language, but a promotion of a foreign culture in the country and among children, young adults, and youths. The Western thinkers have time and again said that instead of colonialist expansionism the best and the least costly way would have been the inculcation of thought and culture to the younger generation of countries. The head of the state-run High Education Council, Mehdi Navid-Adham state that teaching English in government and non-government primary schools in the official curriculum are against laws and regulations. Interestingly, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is often criticized by Iran's Islamic leaders and was warned about the dangers of a cultural invasion.",
