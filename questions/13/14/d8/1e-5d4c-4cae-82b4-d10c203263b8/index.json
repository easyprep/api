  "question": "What will happen to a ball if it is dropped from a spacecraft revolving around the earth at a height of 120 km?",
  "option1": "It will go very far in the space",
  "option2": "It will fall down to the earth gradually",
  "option3": "If will move with the same speed tangentially to the spacecraft",
  "option4": "It will continue to move with velocity v along the original orbit of spacecraft",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "It will continue to move with velocity v along the original orbit of spacecraft",
  "explanation": "If a ball is dropped from a spacecraft revolving around the earth at a height of 120 km, it will continue to move with velocity v along the original orbit of spacecraft. As the ball possess same initial tangential speed as that of space craft. So, it also feels the condition of weightlessness."
