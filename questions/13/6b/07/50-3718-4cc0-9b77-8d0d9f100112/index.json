The first ever radio broadcast in the country went on the air from the Bombay Station under a private company - the Indian Broadcasting Company (IBC). It was started by the British Viceroy of India Lord Irwin. Since 1927, radio has been an important part in people\\'s life in India. On 8th of June 1936, the Indian State Broadcasting Service became All India Radio (AIR).

The AIR is one of the largest public broadcasting organizations in the world. It has 414 stations in 23 languages and broadcasts in 179 dialects."
