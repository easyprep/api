  "question": "Which among the following is the most primitive life form?",
  "option1": "Bacteria",
  "option2": "Protozoa",
  "option3": "Virus",
  "option4": "Blue-green algae",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Bacteria",
  "explanation": "Scientific experiments in the 1950s showed how lightning flashes might create amino acids, the basic chemicals of life, from the waters and gases of early Earth. But no one knows how these chemicals joined up to become ‘self replicating’ i.e. Able to make copies of themselves. This is the key to life which remains a mystery. However, the first life forms were probably a tiny bacteria called archebacteria, which thrive in very hot, chemically rich places. Virus are NOT living organisms by themselves."
