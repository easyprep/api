  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "<strong>Swiss-system<br /></strong>In a Swiss-system tournament, no one is eliminated. Normally, as the players continue to win games, they face progressively stronger opposition, with the result that those participants who are not so successful end up playing against each other. In Swiss-system events, players are paired with each other according to the following general principles such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A player is not paired with any other player more than once.</li>\r\n<li>Players with the same score are paired whenever possible.</li>\r\n<li>Colors are assigned to players by the director as fairly as possible. Alternating colors is the ideal.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Round-Robin System<br /></strong>In round-robin tournaments, a player plays one game with every other player in the tournament. The person with the highest score at the end of the tournament is the winner. Please note that each participant plays every other participant an equal number of times. Round-robin tournaments involving four participants are known as quads. <br /><strong>Double Round-Robin</strong> <br />Double round-robin is the same as round-robin except that a player plays each of the other players twice; one game as white and one as black.<br /><strong>Scheveningen system<br /></strong>Scheveningen system is similar to the Round-robin style. The Scheveningen system is often used to face two chess teams against each other, where each player on one team plays each player on the other team.<br /><strong>Match Play<br /></strong>Match play occurs when two players are playing a series of games against one another in a match. This is not a very popular format except on the world class level. Match play was often used in the past for the World Chess Championship where the challenger plays a match against the World Champion for the title.<br /><strong>KO<br /></strong>KO refers to Knockout. This is not a very popular match play tournament format in chess. A knockout tournament is a single-elimination tournament where the loser of each match is immediately eliminated from the tournament. This means that the tournament is conducted as a series of matches in which the winner of each match advances to the next round and the loser is eliminated. Well known chess tournaments held in the knockout format include London 1851 and the 2007 Chess World Cup.<br /><strong>Tie Breaker<br /></strong>This refers to a number of different systems that are used to break ties, and thus designate a single winner, where multiple players or teams tie for the same place in a Swiss system chess tournament. Most of the methods are numerical methods based on the games that have already been played or other objective factors, while some methods require additional games to be played, etc. The idea behind the methods based on the games already played is that the player that played the harder competition to achieve the same number of points should be ranked higher.<br /><strong>Armageddon<br /></strong>A game which White must win to win the match, but which Black only needs to draw to win the match. White has more time than Black: the discrepancy can vary."
