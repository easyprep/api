  "answer": "Uttarakhand",
  "explanation": "The Alaknanda is a Himalayan river flowing in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. It is one of the two head streams of river Ganga.<br />The recent landslide and glacial lake outburst in Uttarakhand caused flooding in the Alaknanda river. This led to huge volume of debris in the river that is being carried downstream. The presence of huge debris volume has changed the colour of the river.",
