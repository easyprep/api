  "question": "The Ghost Orchid plants have been in news in context with the drying out of marshlands and forests. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Ghost Orchids are found only in Cuba.</li>\n<li>Longer dry season in these flooded forests is the reason for their habitat’s drying out.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Ghost Orchids are epiphytes that are found only in two places: Cuba and Florida. They are very delicate and grow in marshlands and flooded forests, atop trees. The Super Ghost is a large Ghost Orchid Plant in Florida’s Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary in USA.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe flooded forests and swamplands are drying out because of longer spells of dry seasons. Eg: Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary is now experiencing more than three months of parched season. This adversely affects these plants. Other reasons include diversion of water from these habitats using canals, extraction for agricultural and other uses by suburbs, etc."
