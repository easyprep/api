The schemes are \\\"Utkarsh Bangla\\\" and \\\"Sabooj Sathi\\\". Out of 1062 nominations in 18 categories, Utkarsh Bangla got the topmost award and emerged a winner in Capacity Building category. Sabooj Sathi ranked in the first five as a champion project under ICT application: E-Government category. The \\\"Utkarsh Bangla\\\" project aims at creating a pool of skilled candidates who are industry ready, while under the \\\"Sabooj Sathi\\\" scheme, bi-cycles are distributed to students between class IX and XII studying in government run and government aided schools and madrashas of the state. Earlier, in 2017, the West Bengal government had received another UN award for its \\'Kanyashree\\' project, a targeted conditional cash transfer scheme aimed at promoting education among girls. The WSIS Prizes is an international contest to create an effective mechanism to evaluate and recognise individuals, governments and private bodies for outstanding success in implementing development oriented strategies that leverage the power of ICTs as an enabler of the development."
