  "question": "Consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Warm currents generally flow from equator towards poles</li>\r\n<li>Cold current are generally found on the west coast of continents in northern hemisphere</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "Those currents that flow from the Equator towards the poles are warmer than the surrounding water and so they are called warm currents. The ocean currents that flow from the polar areas towards the Equator are cooler compared to the surrounding water, so they are called cold currents. The actual difference in temperature of warm and cold currents is only a few degrees. The cold currents are usually found on the west coast of the continents in the low and middle latitudes in both the hemispheres and on the east coast in the middle latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere."
