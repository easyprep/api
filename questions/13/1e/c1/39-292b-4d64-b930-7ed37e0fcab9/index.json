  "option2": "Andheri",
  "option3": "Churchgate",
  "option4": "Elphinstone",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Elphinstone",
  "explanation": "On July 19, the Elphinstone Road station  on the suburban rail network of Mumbai has been rechristened as Prabhadevi station  in honour of a local deity Prabhadevi and to erase a \\\"colonial\\\" name. The new nomenclature of the station will be PBHD. The station was named after Lord Elphinstone who had taken over as the then Governor of Bombay in 1853 (1853-1860), the year railways were introduced in India. The deity Prabhadevi also has its own importance as the area is locally known as Prabhadevi, after the temple that was first established by Raja Bhimdev  in 13th century."
