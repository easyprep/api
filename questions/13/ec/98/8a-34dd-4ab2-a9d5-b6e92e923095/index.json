  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nCyanide is used widely in the jewellery industry. It is used to clean gold and give it the reddish yellow glow. This is by removing the impurities in the gold and obtaining its original color. The chemical was used in the serial murder of 6 individuals over 14 years in Kerala.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nCyanide is regulated under the Poisons Act, 1919. Under it, the state regulates the chemicalâ€™s circulation using the Kerala Poisons Rule, 1996. At a time, any agency can stock only 250g of the chemical. Even for this, license is required."
