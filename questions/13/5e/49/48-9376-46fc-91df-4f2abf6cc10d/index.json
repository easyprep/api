  "question": "With reference to US ban on ground handling in its airports by Air India, consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>India allows ground handling by foreign airliners.</li>\n<li>The Air Service Agreement provides for mutual rights to handle its own ground operations in the other’s territory.</li>\n<li>India is not signatory to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 and 3",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 only",
  "option4": "2 only",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 only",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nIndia does not allow self- handling of ground operations by foreign airliners. Ground operations include refuelling, boarding, baggage handling and catering. The measure was implemented as per the Ground Handling Services Regulation, 2017. The ban was imposed by AAI/ Airport Authority of India. Only domestic scheduled flights and helicopters can handle their own ground operations.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nAir Service Agreement was signed between India and the US in 2005. This is to promote air travel between the two countries. The agreement gives the right to “self-handling” to the airliners in both countries’ airports. It also gives the freedom to select from among competing agencies to avail such services. This is subject to physical constraints due to considerations for airport safety. The moves on both sides deviate from this provision.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nIndia is signatory to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation. Hence it is a part of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, established by the convention. US is also a member. It is an agency of the UN. It establishes rules for aircraft registration, airspace, safety, etc."
