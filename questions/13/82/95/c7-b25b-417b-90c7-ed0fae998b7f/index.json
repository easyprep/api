  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Egyptian Literature",
  "explanation": "The Story of Sinuhe (also known as Sanehat) is considered one of the finest works of ancient Egyptian literature. The Middle Kingdom of ancient Egypt (2000 BCE â€“ 1700 BCE) saw the start of more formal writing which included religious scripts, administrative notes, and more in-depth fictional writing. One of the most iconic pieces of writing to come out of the Middle Kingdom was The Story of Sinuhe. Sinuhe was a courier and assistant to the King of Egypt, Amenhotep I. He fled Egypt and joined a Bedouin tribe to the east and started a new life near Syria. Once he reached old age he returned and finished out his life in Egypt. The importance of this story goes beyond the structure and writing techniques of the text as it provides insight into the cultural differences between Egypt and the Near East. This 4,000-year-old tale provides insight into the world and mind of an Egyptian and is just another example of Egyptian brilliance."
