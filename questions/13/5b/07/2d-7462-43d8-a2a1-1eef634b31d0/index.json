  "question": "A cistern can be filled by pipe P in 3 hours and pipe Q in 5 hours and empty by pipe R in 2 hours. If all these pipes are open, then in how many hours the cistern will be full?",
  "option1": "10 hours",
  "option2": "15 hours",
  "option3": "30 hours",
  "option4": "Cannot be filled",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "30 hours",
  "explanation": "Because as per the question part of the cistern filled by all pipes in an hour $latex = \\\\frac{1}{3}+\\\\frac{1}{5}-\\\\frac{1}{2}=\\\\frac{10+6-15}{30}=\\\\frac{1}{30}&s=1$\r\nSo, the cistern will be filled in 30 hours if all pipes are open. \r\nHence option [C] is correct answer."
