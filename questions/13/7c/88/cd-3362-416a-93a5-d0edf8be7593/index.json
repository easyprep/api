It originates in Maharashtra and drains into the Bay of Bengal. It is categorised as a substantial flooding risk due to rising sea-levels.\nStatement 2 is correct:\nThe Polavaram project is located on this river in Andhra Pradesh. It is designated as ‘national project’. The project is being constructed using funds from NABARD and fund allocations by the state and central governments under schemes like PM Krishi Sinchayee Yojana.\nStatement 3 is correct:\nThe river has a number of wildlife sanctuaries on its basin. The Papikonda National Park is in AP. Established in 1978, it holds many endangered species including the Bengal Tiger. It is an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area.  The park was in news because of the threat it faces from the Polavaram project which may cause its partial submergence."
