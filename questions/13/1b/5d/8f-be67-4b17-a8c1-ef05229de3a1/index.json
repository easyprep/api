  "question": "Which ocean houses the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"French Austral Lands and Seas\"?",
  "option1": "Pacific Ocean",
  "option2": "Indian Ocean",
  "option3": "Atlantic Ocean",
  "option4": "Arctic Ocean",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Indian Ocean",
  "explanation": "The French Austral Lands and Seas comprise the largest of the rarely emerged landmasses in the southern Indian Ocean: the Crozet Archipelago, the Kerguelen Islands, Saint-Paul and Amsterdam Islands as well as 60 small sub-Antarctic islands. This ‘oasis’ in the middle of the Southern Ocean covers an area of more than 67 million ha and supports one of the highest concentrations of birds and marine mammals in the world. In particular, it has the largest population of King Penguins and Yellow-nosed albatrosses in the world. The remoteness of these islands from centres of human activity makes them extremely well-preserved showcases of biological evolution and a unique terrain for scientific research."
