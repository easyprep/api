  "answer": "1 & 3",
  "explanation": "Due to lack of direct contact and familiarity with Gandhiji, some of the Nobel committee members voted against him, thus causing a big omission on the part of the awards committee. In 1937, some members recognized his greatness, whereas the others felt he was inconsistent in his pacifism and was too much of a nationalist and an ordinary politician. In 1947, the committee was more favorably disposed to Gandhiji, but thought it odd to select him for the prize when India and Pakistan were engaged in a bitter separation and conflict. In 1948, after the assassination of Gandhiji, the committee almost finalized selecting Gandhiji for the award, but held back their decision, as several advisors of the committee felt that the Nobel prize cannot be given to anybody posthumously.<br> However, statement 2 in my question is NOT correct. Itâ€™s true that Nobody had ever been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize posthumously. But according to the statutes of the Nobel Foundation in force at that time, the Nobel Prizes could, under certain circumstances, be awarded posthumously. Thus it was possible to give Gandhi the prize. However, Gandhi did not belong to an organization, he left no property behind and no will; who should receive the Prize money? The Director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute, August Schou, asked another of the Committee&#8217;s advisers, lawyer Ole Torleif Roed, to consider the practical consequences if the Committee were to award the Prize posthumously. Roed suggested a number of possible solutions for general application. Subsequently, he asked the Swedish prize-awarding institutions for their opinion. The answers were negative; posthumous awards, they thought, should not take place unless the laureate died after the Committee&#8217;s decision had been made.<br> When in 1989, Dalai Lama was chosen for the award, the committee stated that the award was in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi.<br> <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/gandhi/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/gandhi/</a>"
