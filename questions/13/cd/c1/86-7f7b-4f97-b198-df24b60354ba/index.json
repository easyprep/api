  "question": "The recoiling of gun is an example of which of the following?",
  "option1": "Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum",
  "option2": "Law of Conservation of Linear Momentum",
  "option3": "Conversion of Kinetic Energy to Potential Energy",
  "option4": "Law of Conservation of Energy",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Law of Conservation of Linear Momentum",
  "explanation": "The recoiling of gun is an example of Law of Conservation of Linear Momentum. When gun fires a bullet, it experiences a force in forward direction (action) , as a result the gun exerts a backward force (reaction) on the shoulder. Thus, it is in accordance with Law of Conservation of Linear Momentum which is also the Newton's 3rd law of motion."
