  "question": "ISRO has successfully launched its radar imaging satellite RISAT-2B through which launch vehicle?",
  "option1": "PSLV-C44",
  "option2": "PSLV-C46",
  "option3": "PSLV-C47",
  "option4": "PSLV-C45",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "PSLV-C46",
  "explanation": "The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has successfully launched its newest  microwave  earth observation satellite RISAT-2B from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) at Sriharikota through its trusted workhorse PSLV-C46.  The 615-kg RISAT-2B meant for application in fields such as surveillance, agriculture, forestry and disaster management support. It will replace the RISAT-2, which was launched in 2009. The new satellite will enhance India\\'s all-weather (space-based) capabilities in agriculture, forestry and disaster management. Its X-band synthetic aperture radar can give added details such as size of objects on Earth, structures, movement and change. The information will complement data from the normal optical remote-sensing satellites. Such data are useful for agencies that need ground imageries during cloud, rain and in the dark."
