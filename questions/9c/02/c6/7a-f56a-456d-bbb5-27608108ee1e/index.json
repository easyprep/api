  "question": "With reference to the recently unearthed fossils of Danuvius guggenmosi in southern Germany, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is a dinosaur capable of flight.</li>\n<li>It is adapted for bipedalism.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Danuvius guggenmosi is an ancient ape that lived about 11.6 million years ago. Its fossil was unearthed from southern Germany. The fossil revealed the most complete skeletal remains of a male specimen of this extinct species. The species was reported to be of short stature: about 3ft.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Danuvius guggenmosi fossil is now the oldest example of bipedalism. Bipedalism is the ability to walk upright on two legs. The straight lower limbs as implied by the fossil bones led scientists to conclude this about this ancient species."
