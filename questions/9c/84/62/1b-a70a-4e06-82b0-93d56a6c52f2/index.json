  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "Recently, the Union Cabinet has approved the continuation of the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) beyond the 12th Five-year plan to 2019-20. PMSSY is a central sector scheme. So, the first statement is correct. Second statement is incorrect. This scheme aims at correcting the imbalances in the availability of affordable tertiary health care facilities in different parts of the country (not primary health-care). It aims for augmenting facilities for quality medical education in the under-served states in particular. The financial outlay for this purpose is Rs 14,832 crore. Under this scheme, new All India Institute of Medical Science is established and the other government medical colleges are being upgraded."
