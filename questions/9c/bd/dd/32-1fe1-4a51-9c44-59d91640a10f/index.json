  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "<strong>State Election Commissions in India are subordinate to the Central Election Commission of India</strong> <br />This is incorrect and often misread statement. The state election commissions are <em><u>independent of the Election Commission of India</u></em>. The provisions regarding Election Commission of India were under original constitution and this body was set up in 1950 with responsibilities to election of President and Vice President of India, to Parliament, and to the state Assemblies and Legislative Councils. It draws its existence from the constitution and its functional powers from the constitution as well as Representation of the People Acts. The State Election Commissions were set up much later and via the laws of respective states. They supervise municipal and panchayat elections. Thus, both the authorities have a similar mandate but they are independent of each other and draw powers from different laws. <br /><strong>Both State and Central Election Commissions in India derive their powers from Representation of the People Acts<br /></strong> This is incorrect statement. The state election commissions derive their powers of respective state laws. However, they find provisions regarding their origin in constitution 73<sup>rd</sup> and 74<sup>th</sup> amendment acts."
