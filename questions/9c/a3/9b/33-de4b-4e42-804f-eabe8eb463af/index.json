  "question": "Optical fibre works on which of the following principle of light?",
  "option1": "Total internal reflection",
  "option2": "Diffraction",
  "option3": "Refraction",
  "option4": "Reflection",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Total internal reflection",
  "explanation": "Total internal reflection in an optical fiber. When light passes from a medium with one index of refraction (m1) to another medium with a lower index of refraction (m2), it bends or refracts away from an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface (normal line)."
