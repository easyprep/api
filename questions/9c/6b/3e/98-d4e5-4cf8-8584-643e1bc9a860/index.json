  "explanation": "Children’s Day is a day recognized to celebrate children. The day is celebrated on various dates in different countries. Children’s Day began on the second Sunday of June in 1857 by Reverend Dr. Charles Leonard, pastor of the Universalist Church of the Redeemer in Chelsea, Massachusetts: Leonard held a special service dedicated to, and for the children. Leonard named the day Rose Day, though it was later named Flower Sunday, and then Children’s Day.<br />The International Day for Protection of Children is observed in many countries as Children’s Day on 1 June since 1950. It was established by the Women’s International Democratic Federation on its congress in Moscow (4 November 1949).[citation needed] Major global variants include a Universal Children’s Holiday on 20 November, by United Nations recommendation."
