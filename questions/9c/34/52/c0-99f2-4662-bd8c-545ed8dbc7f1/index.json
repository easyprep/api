  "question": "If two items of A is equal to three times of B and also equal to four times of C, then A : B : C is :",
  "option1": "2 : 3 : 5",
  "option2": "3 : 4 : 2",
  "option3": "4 : 6 : 3",
  "option4": "6 : 4 : 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "6 : 4 : 3",
  "explanation": "According to the question, \r\n$latex 2A = 3B$\r\n$latex => B = \\\\frac{2}{3}A&s=1$\r\nand $latex 2A = 4C$\r\n$latex => C = \\\\frac{1}{2}A&s=1$\r\n$latex \\\\therefore A : B : C = A : \\\\frac{2}{3}A : \\\\frac{1}{2}A&s=1$\r\n$latex = 1 : \\\\frac{2}{3}: \\\\frac{1}{2} = 6:4:3&s=1$\r\nHence option [D] is correct answer."
