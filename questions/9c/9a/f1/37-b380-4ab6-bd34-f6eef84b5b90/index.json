  "question": "Which legislation of British attracted the slogan \"No vakil, no daleel, no appeal\"?",
  "option1": "Defence of India Act 1915",
  "option2": "Indian Press Act, 1910",
  "option3": "Rowatt Act, 1919",
  "option4": "Prevention of Seditious Meetings Act, 1907",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Rowatt Act, 1919",
  "explanation": "On the promise of democratic reforms after World War I (WW-I), India had massively contributed to the British war efforts. Despite the huge economic and manpower contribution by poor India, and despite the solemn assurance the British had given, the deceitful, dishonest British reneged on the promise of democratic reforms, and instead came up with the draconian Rowlatt Acts on 21 March 1919. The draconian legislation provided for arrest and house-search without warrant; in-camera trial; non-provision of a counsel to the accused; and no right of appeal against orders of special tribunals. The legislation attracted a telling slogan: “No vakil (lawyer), no daleel (argument), no appeal.” The Rowlatt Acts of 1919 were rammed through the Legislative Council despite the unanimous Indian opposition. The Acts amounted to betrayal of trust by the British."
