  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "<strong>First statement is incorrect </strong> Ockhi originated near the south-western coast of Sri Lanka, and travelled very near the southern-most tip of the Indian mainland, along the coasts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, towards the Lakshadweep islands, Maharashtra and Gujarat. <strong>Second statement is incorrect</strong> Ockhi was described as a “very severe cyclonic storm” as it had wind speeds between 155 and 165 km per hour. Super-cyclones are those with wind speed above 220 km per hour."
