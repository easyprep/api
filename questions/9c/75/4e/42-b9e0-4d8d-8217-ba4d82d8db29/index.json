  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nOperation Alberich was carried out by the German forces in France. It was a strategic withdrawal by the German forces in light of manpower shortage to battle the Allied powers. The operation saw the retirement of the forces to the Hindenburg Line, also known as the Siegfried Line.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe operation was carried out between February and March of 1917- during the World War I. Though it resulted in tactical success for the German forces, it led to disproportionate destructions due to its ‘scorched earth’ policy. It involved destruction of anything that the Allied Powers could find useful, including roads, villages, bridges, etc."
