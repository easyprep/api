  "answer": "It is a condition in which the human brain remains disoriented for most of the conscious period",
  "explanation": "Mosaicism is a condition in which cells within the same person have a different genetic makeup. It is caused by an error in cell division very early in the development of the unborn baby. It is called “mosaicism” because, in a way, the cells of the body are different but are collected in the same structure like a mosaic. For example, if an individual has mosaic trisomy 18, this means that some of the cells have three copies of chromosome 18 while other cells have two copies of chromosome 18. This usually leads to genetic and congenital disorders such as Down’s syndrome etc."
