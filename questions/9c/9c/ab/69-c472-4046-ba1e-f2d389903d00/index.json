It is the first of its kind initiative by any fund house in India to do mutual fund transactions through the popular cross-platform messaging app. Investors can use WhatsApp to invest in any scheme from Motilal Oswal AMC. The investor through his/her registered number can initiate a transaction in Motilal Oswal MF schemes just by typing ‘Hi’. A customer can complete the entire process in less than two minutes and gets an instant transaction confirmation through the medium. The investor can make the investments either in a lump sum or through systematic investment plans (SIP).This feature is not a part of WhatsApp Pay and is different from using it as a payment channel."
