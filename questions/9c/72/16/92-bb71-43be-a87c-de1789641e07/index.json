  "option1": "1 and 2",
  "option2": "1 and 3",
  "option3": "2 and 3",
  "option4": "1 only",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 only",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe bill gives reservations for people of certain reserved categories in state government posts and also admission to professional institutions. The 2004 act and the 2019 ordinance are replaced by the bill. The bill amends the 2004 provision of reservation only to people along the LAC by adding in people along the IB into the eligible category.Â \n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe IB is based on the Radcliffe line of 1947. It is the legally recognised international demarcation between India and Pakistan. Created in 1972, the IB runs between the Line of Control in the North to the Zero Point in the South. The Radcliffe line was created by Sir Cyril Radcliffe during the partition.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe LAC is based on the McMahon line. It separates the Indian controlled territories from the Chinese controlled territories. This was formed after the 1962 war. It excludes Aksai Chin from Indian Territory. The McMahon line was proposed by Henry McMahon during the Shimla Convention."
