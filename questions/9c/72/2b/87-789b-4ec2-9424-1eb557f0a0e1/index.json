  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Soil Health Card scheme is being implemented by the department of agriculture under the ministry of agriculture and farmersâ€™ welfare. Under this scheme, a soil health card is given to the farmers which gives information about 12 parameters of the soil in their holdings.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe scheme uses mobile and static soil testing laboratories to test soil samples in farmers holdings- both irrigated and rain-fed lands. There are 800 existing labs and the states have also sanctioned new labs. These labs costs up to 5 lakh INR- 75% of which is funded by the state or central government."
