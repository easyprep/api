  "option3": "It's weight and it's acceleration",
  "option4": "It's speed and it's velocity",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "It's mass and it's weight",
  "explanation": "The weight of an object and its mass are directly proportional. For a given gravitational field strength, the greater the mass of the object, the greater its weight."
