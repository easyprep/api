  "answer": "With Her: A Skilled Girl Force",
  "explanation": "The International Day of the Girl is observed every year on October 11 to highlight and address the needs and challenges girls face while promoting girls\\' empowerment and the fulfilment of their human rights.  Today\\'s generation of girls are preparing to enter a world of work that is being transformed by innovation and automation. Educated and skilled workers are in great demand, but roughly a quarter of young people, most of them female, are currently neither employed nor in education or training. Of the 600 million adolescent girls that will enter the workforce in the next decade, more than 90% of those living in developing countries will work in the informal sector, where low or no pay, abuse and exploitation are common.   Hence, under the 2018  theme “With Her: A Skilled Girl Force”, the  day will mark the beginning of a year-long effort to bring together partners and stakeholders to highlight, advocate for and invest in girls’ most pressing needs and opportunities to attain skills for employability."
