  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Capital plays an important role in the location of industry, which is the mainstay of most modem manufacturing. Capital investment, credit and banking facilities are largely available in large cities Hence, industries are greatly concentrated in cities and their suburbs. Availability of banking and credit facilities in rural areas will lead to decentralization of industries. Capital is rarely an important location factor today because capital is probably the most mobile of all industrial resources."
