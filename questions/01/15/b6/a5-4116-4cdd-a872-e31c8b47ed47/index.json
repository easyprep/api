  "question": "Which of the following telescopes has recently helped to discover 300000 new galaxies?",
  "option1": "LOFAR",
  "option2": "Hubble",
  "option3": "Spitzer Space",
  "option4": "Euclid",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "LOFAR",
  "explanation": "An international team of more than 200 astronomers from 18 countries has published the first phase of a major new radio sky survey at unprecedented sensitivity using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) telescope in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. The survey discovered 3,00,000 hidden galaxies using radio astronomy in a tiny corner of the northern hemisphere at low radio frequency. It is believed that these findings will help shed new light on some of the Universeâ€™s deepest secrets. This includes the physics of black holes as well as research into how galaxy clusters evolve. The LOFAR telescope   is operated by ASTRON in The Netherlands and is considered to be the world\\'s leading telescope of its type. It is made up of a network of radio antenna across seven countries, forming the equivalent of a 1,300-km diameter satellite dish. It is capable of detecting light source beyond the power of optical instruments. Radio astronomy allows scientists to detect radiation produced when massive celestial objects interact."
