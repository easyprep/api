  "question": "The applicability of sales and service tax to incorporated and unincorporated clubs was discussed at the Supreme Court recently. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The food supplied by an incorporated members’ club to its permanent members is liable only to service tax and not sales tax.</li>\n<li>The food supplied by an unincorporated members’ club to its permanent members is liable to sales tax.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nIn October, the Supreme Court held that the supply of food and drinks by an incorporated club to its permanent members is exempt from both sales tax and service tax. The court held that since the club and its members are considered as one entity, there is no sale of goods.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe court held that the supply of food and drinks by an unincorporated club to its members is exempt from sales tax. In an incorporated business, the corporation is separate from the business owner which is not true in case of an unincorporated business."
