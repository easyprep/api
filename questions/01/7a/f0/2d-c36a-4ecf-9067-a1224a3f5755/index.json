  "explanation": "Finland houses the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Fortress of Suomenlinna. This sea fortress, also known as Sveaborg, was built gradually from 1748 onwards by Sweden on a group of islands belonging to the district of Helsinki, the capital city of Finland. The work was supervised by the Swedish Admiral Augustin Eherensvard, who adapted Vauban's theories to the very special geographical features of the region. This fortress has served to defend three different sovereign states over the years: the kingdom of Sweden, the Russian Empire, and most recently the Republic of Finland."
