  "question": "As per the recent judgement of the Supreme Court, which category of banks may also be included under SARFAESI Act?",
  "option1": "Regional Rural Banks",
  "option2": "Cooperative Banks",
  "option3": "Small Finance Banks",
  "option4": "Local Area Banks",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Cooperative Banks",
  "explanation": "The Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002, allow banks and financial institutions to auction properties, when borrowers fail to repay their loans.\r\nRecently as per the judgement of the Supreme Court, the cooperative banks that are involved in the banking activities are considered as a ‘banking company’. Hence the SARFAESI act may be modified to include the procedure of loan recovery by cooperative banks."
