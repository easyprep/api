  "answer": "Prayuth Chan-ocha",
  "explanation": "The Thai parliament has recently elected ex military government chief Prayuth Chan-ocha as its new Prime  Minister. He beat the popular billionaire leader of the anti-junta Future Forward Party, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, with 500 votes to 244 after a 12-hour session that included 10 hours of fierce debate in Parliament on June 5.  Prayuth will now head a coalition government led by the pro-military Palang Pracharat Party. Prayuth\\'s appointment becomes official when it is endorsed by King Maha Vajiralongkorn.  Thailand is a constitutional monarchy and has not had a royal run for frontline office since 1932."
