  "option1": "Thank you for saving my life",
  "option2": "Blood connects us all",
  "option3": "Every blood donor is a hero",
  "option4": "Give Blood. Give Now. Give Often",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Give Blood. Give Now. Give Often",
  "explanation": "The World Blood Donor Day (WBDD) is observed every year on June 14 to raise awareness of the need for safe blood and blood products, and to thank blood donors for their voluntary, life-saving gifts of blood. Every pint of blood donated can save more than 3 lives. Thus, if you began donating blood at age 18 and donated every 90 days until you reached 60, you would have donated 30 gallons of blood, potentially helping save more than 500 lives. The 2017 theme “Give Blood. Give Now. Give Often” focus on blood donation in emergency situations."
