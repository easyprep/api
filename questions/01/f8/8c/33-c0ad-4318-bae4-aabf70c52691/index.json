  "question": "Which country houses the Grand Etang Lake?",
  "option1": "Grenada",
  "option2": "Dominica",
  "option3": "Barbados",
  "option4": "The Bahamas",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Grenada",
  "explanation": "Grand Etang Lake is a crater lake in an extinct volcano. It is located on the island of Grenada, in Saint Andrew Parish. Evidence suggests that the Grand Etang Lake is connected to Kick 'em Jenny, an active submarine volcano to the north. This is because when Kick Em Jenny was observed bubbling, so too were the waters in Grand Etang Lake. The Grand Etang Lake is 530 m above sea level and it is one of the two crater lakes on the island (the other being Lake Antoine).",
