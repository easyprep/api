  "question": "A, B and C together can complete a piece of work in 30 minutes. A and B together can complete the same work in 50 minutes. C alone can complete the work in :",
  "option1": "60 minutes",
  "option2": "75 minutes",
  "option3": "80 minutes",
  "option4": "150 minutes",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "75 minutes",
  "explanation": "Work done by (A + B + C) in 1 minute $latex = \\\\frac{1}{30}&s=1$\r\nWork done by (A + B) in 1 minute $latex = \\\\frac{1}{50}&s=1$\r\n∴ Work done by C alone 1 minute $latex = \\\\frac{1}{30}-\\\\frac{1}{50}&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{5-3}{150} = \\\\frac{2}{150} = \\\\frac{1}{75}&s=1$\r\n∴ C alone will complete the work in 75 minutes. \r\nHence option [B] is correct answer."
