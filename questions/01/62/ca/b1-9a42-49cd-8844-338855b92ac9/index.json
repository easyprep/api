  "question": "The solar eclipse achieves totality only in the limited geographical regions because?",
  "option1": "the earth is not a smooth flat surface, but has elevations and depressions",
  "option2": "the size of the shadow of the moon on the earth is small compared to the cross section of the earth",
  "option3": "the trajectories of the earth around the sun and the moon around the earth are not perfect circles",
  "option4": "sun rays can reach most of the peripheral regions of the shadow of the moon due to a atmospheric refraction",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "the size of the shadow of the moon on the earth is small compared to the cross section of the earth",
  "explanation": "<em>Because</em> of the geometry of <em>eclipses</em>, the moon\\'s shadow is narrow when it reaches Earth, so the <em>region</em> from which the <em>eclipse</em> is visible is small. The shadow can never be more than 166 miles wide. People outside the path of <em>totality</em> can see a partial <em>eclipse</em>, with the moon covering <em>only</em> a portion of the <em>sun\\'s</em> disk."
