  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe top most decision making body in the Indian Railways is the Railway Board. It is organised into departments like finance, mechanical, etc. The board is to be organised along functional lines. The restructuring exercise is to rename the chairperson, who heads the board, as CEO.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe restructuring is to reduce the strength of the Railway Board to 4 members. Each of the proposed categories of operations- finance, rolling stock, operation and business development and infrastructure- is to be headed by the board members. The restructuring is also looking at increasing flexibility in induction of independent board members."
