  "option5": "",
  "answer": "France",
  "explanation": "The Causses and the Cevennes, Mediterranean agro-pastoral Cultural Landscape is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the southern part of central France. This site is a mountain landscape interspersed by deep valleys that is representative of the relationship between agro-pastoral systems and their biophysical environment, notably through drailles or drove roads. Villages and substantial stone farmhouses on deep terraces of the Causses reflect the organization of large abbeys from the 11th century. Mont Loz√®re, inside the property, is one of the last places where summer transhumance is still practised in the traditional way, using the drailles."
