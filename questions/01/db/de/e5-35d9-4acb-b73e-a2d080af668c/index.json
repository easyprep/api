  "answer": "Reserved Subjects and Transferred Subjects",
  "explanation": "In Government of India Act 1919 the spheres of the central and provincial governments were demarcated by a division of subjects into&#8217; central&#8217; and&#8217; provincial&#8217;. Generally speaking, &#8220;central subjects&#8217; included all subjects directly administered by the Government of India or in which extra-provincial interests were dominant, whilst provincial subjects&#8217; included subjects in which the interests of the provinces essentially predominated. The Dyarchy was for the Provincial Governments. The provincial subjects were divided into two categories viz. reserved&#8217; and transferred. Each province was to be governed in relation to &#8216;reserved&#8217; subjects by a Governor in Council, and in relation to &#8216;transferred&#8217; subjects by a Governor acting with ministers. This system was known as Dyarchy. In the selection of subjects to be transferred to ministers, the guiding principle followed was to include in the &#8216; transferred&#8217; list those departments which offered the most opportunity for local knowledge and social service and those in which mistakes that might occur would not be irremediable. Broadly speaking, &#8216; reserved &#8216; subjects comprised all subjects which were not transferred to ministers and embraced such subjects as Land Revenue, finance, and law and order."
