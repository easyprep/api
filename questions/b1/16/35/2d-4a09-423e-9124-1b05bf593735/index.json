  "question": "Which of the following countries has become the first nation in Southeast Asia to legalize medical use of marijuana?",
  "option1": "Indonesia",
  "option2": "Thailand",
  "option3": "Malaysia",
  "option4": "Vietnam",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Thailand",
  "explanation": "Thailand has become the first nation in Southeast Asia to legalize medical use of marijuana, as well as the kratom, a locally grown plant traditionally used as a stimulant and painkiller.  The changes, which become law when published in the Royal Gazette, legalize the production, import, export, possession and use of marijuana and kratom products for medical purposes. But, recreational use of the drugs remains illegal and subject to prison terms and fines commensurate with the quantities involved. Marijuana is a psychoactive drug from the Cannabis plant intended for medical or recreational use. Earlier, in October 2018, Canada officially becomes the 2nd Country in the world to legalize the recreational use of marijuana nationwide after Uruguay."
