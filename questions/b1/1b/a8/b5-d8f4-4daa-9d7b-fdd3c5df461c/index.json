  "question": "Which of the following statements is/are correct regarding Multi Layered plastics which was recently seen in news?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>These are non-recyclable, non-energy recoverable, and have no alternative uses</li>\r\n<li>Government has recently issued a notification to phase out multi-layered plastics</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option form the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 only",
  "option2": "2 only",
  "option3": "1 and 2",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 2",
  "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: MLPs are non-recyclable, non-energy recoverable, and have no alternative uses, and are hence a critical threat to the ecosystem. The same amendment issued the prescription of a central system which will carry the names of producers, brand-owners and importers. This will allow agencies to better track and control the usage of plastics. Mostly, MLP packets have two sheets of plastic enclosing a layer of aluminium, but technically MLP can be any material that has at least one layer of plastic. Statement 2 is correct: The Environment Ministry in a new notification has amended the rules of plastic waste management, and suggested the phasing-out of multi-layered plastics (MLP), the shiny plastic material which is used to package chips, biscuit and ready-to-eat food products."
