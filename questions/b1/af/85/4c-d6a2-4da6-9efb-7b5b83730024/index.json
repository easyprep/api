  "question": "Though cyclones originate in both the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea side however the frequency is quite high in case of Bay of Bengal side especially of the stronger cyclones. What could be the possible reasons for the same? <ol> <li>relative colder water of the Arabian Sea</li> <li>relative distance of Arabian Sea from Pacific Ocean</li> </ol> Select the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The reason is the relative colder water of the Arabian Sea is not a favorable condition for the formation and intensification of cyclones. Apart from that the Bay of Bengal side receives cyclones not only from Bay of Bengal and nearby areas but also from the Pacific Ocean, where the frequency of such cyclones is quite significant. Cyclones become weak once they encounter a big landmass, so cyclone from Bay of Bengal side do not travel to the Arabian Sea side. On the other hand the Arabian Sea side receives only those cyclones which originate locally or the cyclones which travel from the Indian Ocean near Sri Lanka."
