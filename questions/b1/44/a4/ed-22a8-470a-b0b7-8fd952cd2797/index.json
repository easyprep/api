  "question": "In recent times, harvesting the umbilical cord blood just after birth, has been popular as a guarantee of health for the child. What is / are principle(s) behind this?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Umbilical cord blood contains stem cells which can be used to treat hematopoietic and genetic disorders</li>\r\n<li>Umbilical cord blood is a better source of stem cells than placenta</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "Stem cells, which hold the promise of new cell-based therapies to treat critical medical conditions, have to be effectively stored until it’s time to use them. The method is called cryopreservation: it freezes stem cells at temperatures below -150°C, by immersing them in nitrogen vapour. But if the cells are to survive this process, they need to be frozen using a protective compound called a cryoprotectant, which is found to be toxic and can cause serious side-effects when administered. Research is on to find alternative, non-toxic compounds as protective agents of a technology which could rid the world of many diseases. In the past few years, it has become a norm to harvest the umbilical cord blood just after birth, as a guarantee of health for the child.\r\nUmbilical cord blood is blood that remains in the placenta and in the attached umbilical cord after childbirth. Cord blood is collected because it contains stem cells which can be used to treat hematopoietic and genetic disorders (NOT All Diseases, please note). Cord blood is obtained by syringing out the placenta through the umbilical cord at the time of childbirth, after the cord has been detached from the newborn. Cord blood is collected because it contains stem cells, including hematopoietic cells, which can be used to treat hematopoietic and genetic disorders. Although the cord blood does contain stem cells, there are generally not enough stem cells in one unit of cord blood to treat an adult patient. The placenta is a much better source of stem cells since it contains up to ten times more than cord blood. Some placental blood may be returned to the neonatal circulation if the umbilical cord is not prematurely clamped."
