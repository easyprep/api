It is expected to develop into a very severe cyclonic storm. The cyclone has become active simultaneously with the cyclone Maha in the west.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe cyclone was named in accordance with the North Indian Ocean Tropical Cyclone naming system. The name Bulbul is a suggestion of Pakistan. It was preceded by Maha and is to be succeeded by Pawan. After cyclone Pawan, the last name of the system is Amphan, which is a suggestion of Indonesia."
