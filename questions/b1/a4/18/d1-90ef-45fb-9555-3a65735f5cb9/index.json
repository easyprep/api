  "explanation": "The India Disaster Response Summit has inaugurated by Kiren Rijiju, the Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, in New Delhi on November 9, 2017. The summit is jointly organised by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Facebook to leverage social media platforms to \\'prepare, respond and recover\\' for, during and after natural disasters in India. Facebook will now share its disaster maps, developed using aggregated, de-identified data, with NDMA. These maps can aid swift disaster response by providing real-time, actionable information. The Disaster Information Volunteers (DIV) programme, which is being executed by SEEDS, will establish a network of volunteers to provide real-time, first-hand information on disasters in their local communities. The programme will be piloted in two disaster prone states â€” Assam and Uttarakhand."
