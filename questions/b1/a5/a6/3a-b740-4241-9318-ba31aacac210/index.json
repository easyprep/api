  "option2": 1903,
  "option3": 1906,

  "option5": "",
  "answer": 1909,
  "explanation": "Publication of the book â€˜The Indian War of Independence -1857' by VD Savarkar on the Indian revolt of 1857 so rattled the British that they banned both its Marathi and English editions, confiscating all its copies within six months of their release. The book remained banned till independence. The book was published while Savarkar was in London. It was surreptitiously printed in the Netherlands and shipped to India, quickly becoming a bible for the nationalists."
