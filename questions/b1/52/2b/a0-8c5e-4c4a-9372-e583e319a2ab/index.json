  "explanation": "The World Poetry Day (WPD) is celebrated every year on 21st of March across the world to recognize the unique ability of poetry to capture the creative spirit of the human mind. . The day was adopted in 1999 during UNESCOâ€™s 30th session held in Paris. The observance of the day is also meant to encourage a return to the oral tradition of poetry recitals, to promote the teaching of poetry, to restore a dialogue between poetry and the other arts such as theatre, dance, music and painting, and to support small publishers and create an attractive image of poetry in the media, so that the art of poetry will no longer be considered an outdated form of art, but one which enables society as a whole to regain and assert its identity."
