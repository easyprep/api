  "explanation": "To make molasses, sugar cane is harvested and stripped of leaves. Its juice is extracted, usually by cutting, crushing, or mashing. The juice is boiled to concentrate it, promoting sugar crystallization.<br />For every 100 tons of Sugarcane crushed, a Sugar factory produces nearly 30 tons of wet Bagasse. Bagasse is often used as a primary fuel source for Sugar mills; when burned in quantity, it produces sufficient heat and electrical energy to supply all the needs of a typical Sugar mill, with energy to spare.<br />Sugar can be produced from sugarcane and sugar beet, Out of 120 nations nearly 65 nation produced from sugarcane, nearly 40 are from sugar beet and 10 are from both.\r\n&nbsp;"
