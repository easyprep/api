  "option1": "Tea grows at a higher altitude than coffee",
  "option2": "Coffee grows at a higher altitude than tea",
  "option3": "Both grow at about the same altitude",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Tea grows at a higher altitude than coffee",
  "explanation": "Tea requires a temperature ranging from 21째C to 29째C. Tea grows well in the regions which receive rainfall in between 150-200 cm. The soil should be well drained. However, stagnant water damages the tea crops.<br />Coffee plantations require a temperature ranging between 25째C to 30째C. Rainfall should range between 150-200 cm. Coffee plants should be protected from direct sunlight. Hence many trees are planted in between the coffee crop to provide shade to the plant.\r\n&nbsp;"
