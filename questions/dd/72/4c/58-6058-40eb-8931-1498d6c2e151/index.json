  "question": "According to Article 275 of the Constitution of India: <br> 1. Every state in India should be given Grants-in-aid<br> 2. The allocation of grants in aid should be uniformly distributed on the basis of population / Income of the concerned state<br> 3. The role of Finance Commission is to ensure that the grants-in-aid reaches every state<br> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1, 2 & 3 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3 is correct",
  "option4": "None of the statements 1, 2 or 3 is correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of the statements 1, 2 or 3 is correct",
  "explanation": "The first statement is incorrect because article 275 does not say that every state of India is to be assigned some grant in aid. The basic rule is to have a system of Grants-in-aid to the \"needy states\". The grants-in-aids are to be given out of the consolidated fund of India and the amount is fixed by the Finance Commission, using whatever formula it takes as a feasible formula. This means that some states can be kept out of grant-in-aids. Thus statement 2 is also incorrect, there is no need of uniform distribution. The statement 3 also mention that \"grants-in-aid reaches every state as per the provisions of the Constitution of India\" is incorrect."
