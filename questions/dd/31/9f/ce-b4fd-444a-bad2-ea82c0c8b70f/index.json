  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Amazonian Rainforests stretch across 9 countries of which Chile is not one. The forest stretches across Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Columbia, Peru, French Guiana, Guyana and Suriname. 60% of the forest is in Brazil while only 1% is in Ecuador.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe dusts from Sahara desert is important for the fertilisation of the forests. Every year, phosphorus is washed out from the forest soil by rivers and rains. The Sahara dust brings in more phosphorus to compensate. This is with the help of winds."
