  "answer": "Robert Boyle",
  "explanation": "Robert Boyle is generally considered the first modern chemist and one of the founders of modern chemical science. He also pioneered the scientific method. He developed Boyle's Law which states that, under a closed system with constant pressure, the pressure and volume of a gas are inversely proportional. In 1661, Robert Boyle had published The Sceptical Chymist, a treatise on the distinction between chemistry and alchemy. It contains some of the earliest modern ideas of atoms, molecules, and chemical reaction, and marks the beginning of the history of modern chemistry."
