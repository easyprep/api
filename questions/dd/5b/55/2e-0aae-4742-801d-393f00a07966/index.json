  "question": "Which of the following statements is correct about the chemical compound “Meisenheimer complex”, that was recently in news?",
  "option1": "It helps in collection of ambient PM2.5 from atmosphere",
  "option2": "It is highly effective in removing fluoride and metal ions from drinking water",
  "option3": "It is a new chemical compound that makes humans \"invisible\" to mosquitoes thereby acting as alternative to mosquito repellents",
  "option4": "It is used for control of weeds by means other herbicides or weedicides",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "It is highly effective in removing fluoride and metal ions from drinking water",
  "explanation": "A Meisenheimer complex is a negatively charged intermediate formed by the attack of a nucleophile upon one of the aromatic-ring carbons during the course of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction. It is synthesised through a simple, single-step process of mixing two chemicals at room temperature. In recent researches, it has been found that the compound repels water by nature and is highly effective in removing fluoride and metal ions such as lead, mercury, cadmium, copper, and iron from drinking water."
