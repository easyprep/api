  "explanation": "One of the mandates of the Biodiversity Board is to prepare Biodiversity Registers for each LSG involving the local communities.&nbsp; Biodiversity registers are being prepared with the help of the local people and hence referred as People&rsquo;s Biodiversity Register (PBR). Preparation of Biodiversity Register is an attempt to realize the biodiversity at Local Self Government level, States and the whole Country. Identification of biological resources and documentation is one of the prerequisites for the Register preparation which can lead to new discoveries and development of new commercial products, patenting of such products, equitable distribution of benefits, if any, and through this, paving the way for a new economic order in the country through biodiversity conservation. PBR is not simply a register with names of species and their distribution in a given area. It is a comprehensive data base recording people&rsquo;s traditional knowledge and insight of the status, uses, history, ongoing changes and forces driving these changes on the biological diversity resources of their own localities. This will also provide information on the current utilization patterns of biodiversity, its economic benefits to the local communities. The registers form a baseline data for future management strategies required for the sustainable utilization of biodiversity in a decentralized manner. Further, it helps equitable sharing of benefits arising out of commercial utilization of biodiversity resources and knowledge on their uses. The Biodiversity Register offers conservation, protection of IPR and the traditional knowledge. {<a href=\"http://www.keralabiodiversity.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=87&amp;Itemid=91\">Source</a>}&nbsp;"
