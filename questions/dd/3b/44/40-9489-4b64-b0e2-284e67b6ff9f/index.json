  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about Density of ocean water?<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Temperature and density of sea water are inversely related.</li>\r\n<li>Role of temperature in controlling water density is more pronounced in higher latitudes than lower latitudes.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "Density refers to the amount of mass per unit volume of substance and it is generally measured in g/cm3.<br />Temperature and density of sea water are inversely related.<br />The role of temperature in controlling water density is more pronounced in low latitudes, whereas the importance of temperature in controlling sea water decreases poleward."
