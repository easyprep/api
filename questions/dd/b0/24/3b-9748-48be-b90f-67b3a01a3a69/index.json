  "question": "Which state has become the first Indian state to launch High-Risk Pregnancy (HRP) portal?",
  "option1": "Punjab",
  "option2": "Kerala",
  "option3": "Haryana",
  "option4": "Uttar Pradesh",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Haryana",
  "explanation": "Haryana has become the first Indian state to launch High-Risk Pregnancy (HRP) portal which helps in early identification of high-risk pregnant cases up to the grass-roots level and ensures their timely referral to the civil hospitals for further management and delivery by specialists. The High Risk Pregnancy Policy has been implemented across the State since November 2017, for identifying 100% name-based high-risk pregnancy cases, and ensuring their delivery by specialists at civil hospitals. This initiative will definitely increase the pace of decline in Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR), Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and Still Birth Incidence as morbidity and mortality is quite high in high risk pregnant cases, if not managed timely."
