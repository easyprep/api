  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nIt is a multilateral treaty which entered into force in 2003. It was signed on 18<sup>th</sup> December 1990 and hence the date is observed as International Migrants Day. It is noted that none of the migrant receiving states in North America and Western Europe has ratified the convention. Most of its signatories are countries of origin of the migrants.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nIndia is not a signatory to this treaty. While India is the largest source of international migrants, it is also an important migrant receiving state. USA houses the maximum number of international migrants followed by Saudi Arabia and Germany."
