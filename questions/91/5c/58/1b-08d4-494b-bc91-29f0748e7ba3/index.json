An Ordinance was also promulgated on 5th June 1997 to further amend The Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act, 1952, which was later converted into an Act. These Acts introduced various important provisions relating to the mode and manner of elections to the offices of the President and Vice-President. A prospective Presidential candidate should get his nomination paper subscribed by at least fifty electors as proposers, and at least fifty electors as seconders. In the case of prospective Vice-Presidential candidate, the nomination paper should be subscribed by at least twenty electors as proposers, and at least twenty electors as seconders. No elector shall subscribe whether as proposers or as seconder, more than one nomination paper at the same election and if he does so, his signature shall be inoperative on any paper other than the one first delivered."
