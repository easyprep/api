  "question": "In a first, 2 embryos of Northern White Rhinos have been created by international group of scientists. Consider the following statements in this context:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>There are no male members of the species left.</li>\n<li>The animal is listed as critically endangered by IUCN.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Northern White Rhinos is a subspecies that used to inhabit Africa. Over the years the numbers have dwindled and the last male member, Sudan was euthanized in 2018 because of problems related to old age. The new embryos were created using frozen sperms of dead males.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Northern White Rhinos are critically endangered according to IUCN. The scientists have been trying to increase the population from the last two females. The technique called intracytoplasmic sperm injection was used to achieve the two viable embryos. These will be transplanted into a surrogate mother."
