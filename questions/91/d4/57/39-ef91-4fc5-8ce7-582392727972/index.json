  "explanation": "The Ministry of Law and Justice recently issued a Gazette Notification, which declared the United Arab Emirates to be a “reciprocating territory” under Section 44A of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908. The notification also declared a list of courts in the UAE to be ‘Superior Courts’ under the same section of CPC.\r\nThe orders passed by certain designated courts from a ‘reciprocating territory’ can be implemented in India, as if they were passed in India. Besides UAE, the other countries which were declared as reciprocating territories include United Kingdom, Singapore, Bangladesh, Malaysia and New Zealand among others. The decision is believed to help bring down the time required for executing verdicts between the two countries."
