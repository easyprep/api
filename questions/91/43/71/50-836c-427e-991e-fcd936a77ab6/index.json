  "question": "The drug Colistin has been in the news for causing an increase in the instances of drug resistant bacteria in raw food sample due to its over use. In this light, which of the following statements are correct?\n<ol>\n<li>The Ministry of health and family welfare has imposed a blanket ban on Colistin in India.</li>\n<li>Colistin is a ‘drug of last resort’.</li>\n<li>95% of Colistin is imported from China</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 and 2",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 and 3",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe ministry has imposed a ban on Colistin and its formulation from use in feed products for poultry, aqua farming and animal feed supplements. The move comes after a study showing the presence of colistin resistant bacteria in raw food samples by Apollo Cancer Hospital and Christian Medical College of Vellore. The excessive use in feed for food producing animals enables bacteria to evolve resistance to the drug. It is used for treating humans.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nColistin is used as a last resort drug. A ‘last resort drug’ is one that is used when all other drugs fail to serve the purpose. This makes it a valuable and critical tool to medical professionals. They are of different categories- antibiotic (Colistin), antiviral or chemotherapeutic drug. Increasing instances of patients showing resistance to such drugs have been a cause of concern.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nChina is a major source of Colistin for India. Since 95% of the product is imported, the government will find it convenient to limit its usage in the country by limiting the imports. The animal husbandry farmers are already being targeted for creating awareness about the issue. The feed producers have also showed positive response to the call to eliminate the drug from their formulations."
