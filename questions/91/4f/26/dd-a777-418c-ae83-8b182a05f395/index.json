  "explanation": "The Bhashan Char is an uninhabited island around 30km east of Hatiya Island in the South East Bangladesh. The island was formed about two decades ago on the mouth of river Meghna. It is in news recently because thousands of Rohingya living in Bangladesh refugee camps have agreed to move to an island in the Bay of Bengal, despite fears the site is prone to flooding. It must be noted that the Government of Bangladesh has built the relocation camp at Bhashan Char with a capacity to accommodate about 1lakh people in 1440 buildings constructed there at an estimated cost of Tk 2,300 crore."
