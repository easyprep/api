  "question": "Which country's UNESCO World Heritage Site is \"Bergpark Wilhelmshohe\"?",
  "option1": "France",
  "option2": "Germany",
  "option3": "Netherlands",
  "option4": "Ireland",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Germany",
  "explanation": "Germany houses the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Bergpark Wilhelmshohe\". Inspired by the dramatic topography of its site, the Hercules monument and water features of the Bergpark Wilhelmshohe created by the Landgrave Carl from 1689 combine in an outstanding demonstration of man’s mastery over nature. The monumental display of rushing water from the Octagon crowned by the massive Hercules statue via the Vexing Grotto and Artichoke Basin with their hydro-pneumatic acoustic effects, Felsensturz Waterfall and Giant’s Head Basin down the Baroque Cascade to Neptune’s Basin and on towards the crowning glory of the Grand Fountain, a 50-metre high geyser that was the tallest in the world when built in 1767, is focused along an east-west axis terminating in the centre of the city of Kassel. Complemented by the wild Romantic period waterfalls, rapids and cataracts created under Carl’s great-grandson the Elector Wilhelm I, as part of the 18th-century landscape in the lower part of the Bergpark, the whole composition is an outstanding demonstration of the technical and artistic mastery of water in a designed landscape. Together with the 11.5m high copper sheets Hercules statue towering above the park and visible from many kilometres, which represents an extraordinary sculptural achievement, they are testimony to the wealth and power of the 18th &amp; 19th-century European ruling class."
