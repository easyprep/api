  "question": "In context with the Ayodhya verdict, consider the following statements about the principle of adverse possession:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The original owner of a property cannot oust an adverse possessor after 12 years of its possession by the latter.</li>\n<li>It is also applicable to public property.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe principle of adverse possession means that if an owner of a property does not seek legal recourse against an adverse possessor for 12 years, he/ she will lose rights over that property. The possession of the property during this 12 years must be continuous, peaceful and uninterrupted.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe doctrine of adverse possession is not applicable to land or property designated for public use. This is because of cases where encroachers of public property misuse the doctrineâ€™s provisions. The observation was given by the apex court in August."
