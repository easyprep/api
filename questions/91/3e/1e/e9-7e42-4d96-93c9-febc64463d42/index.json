It is an experimental space lab. It tested the in-orbit propellant refuelling technology. This is to help with China’s plans to launch a permanent space station by 2022.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe mission involved two astronauts- Jing Haipeng and Chen Dong- who entered the module after its rendezvous and docking with the Shenzhou-11. They stayed aboard the tiangong-2 for a month and carried out experiments. Eg: physiological effects of weightlessness.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe Tiangong-2 is an improved version of Tiangong-1. The first mission orbited till 2018 and held the first female Chinese astronauts on board. It was China’s first space station experiment mission. The Tiangong-3 will be launched next, as the second mission has de-orbited.\n&nbsp;"
