  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "<strong>Vinoba Bhave participated and was arrested during Quit India Movement</strong> <br />This is a correct statement. <br /><strong>He was first to use the term “Sarvodaya” with respect to his political philosophy</strong> <br />This is not correct statement. The concept was first adopted by Gandhi as he interpreted this concept from Ruskin’s Unto This Last. Vinoba Bhave made it basis of social movement later. To a great extent, this influenced the Bhoodan movement also. <br /><strong>He established Sarvodaya Samaj</strong> <br />This is correct. Vinoba initiated the formation of the Sarvodaya Samaj after Gandhi’s assassination in 1948."
