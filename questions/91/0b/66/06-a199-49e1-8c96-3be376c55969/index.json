  "question": "In context with the US doctors formulating the drug Milasen, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is an example of generic drug.</li>\n<li>It is used to treat Batten Disease.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe drug Milasen is an example of personalised drugs. Its formulation is significant because it opens up the possibility of personalised treatment of patients, especially those suffering from rare and fatal diseases. Rare diseases that affect only a few and hence have low market attractiveness for pharmaceutical companies are called orphan diseases.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe drug was developed for treatment of the Batten Disease. It is a genetic disease and is inherited by the child of a carrier. To develop a drug to treat the disease, the doctors examined the patientsâ€™ genome for mutations."
