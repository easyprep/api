  "explanation": "• Dyarchy, also spelled diarchy, system of double government was introduced by the Government of India Act (1919) (Montague Reforms) for the provinces of British India. It marked the first introduction of the democratic principle into the executive branch of the British administration of India.<br />• In accordance with the provision of the Government of India Act 1935, provincial autonomy was introduced in the provinces in 1937 with broad-based Legislative Assemblies and popular Ministries.<br />• Morley Minto Reforms introduced a system of communal representation for Muslims by accepting the concept of \\'separate electorate\\'. Under this, the Muslim members were to be elected only by Muslim voters. Thus, the Act \\'legalized communalism\\' and Lord Minto came to be known as the Father of Communal Electorate.<br />• The Cripps proposals were an attempt to satisfy the Congress by the promise of a Constituent Assembly and the League by the provision that any province would be at liberty to reject the Constitution and form a new constitution by agreement with the British Government."
