  "question": "The minimum speed required to put a satellite into a given orbit around earth is known as:",
  "option1": "Escape velocity",
  "option2": "Orbital velocity",
  "option3": "Kinetic velocity",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Orbital velocity",
  "explanation": "The minimum speed required to put a satellite into a given orbit around earth is known as Orbital velocity of the satellite. Orbital velocity (v) = (GM/r)<sup>1/2</sup> where G= gravitational constant, M= mass of the earth and r = radius of the orbit of the satellite."
