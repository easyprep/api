  "question": "Consider the following statements: <ol> <li>River Kaveri is the most southerly and the second largest east flowing river system of the peninsular region</li> <li>The Kaveri is the least seasonal river among all the rivers of the peninsular region</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct? &nbsp;",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "River Godavari is the largest among the rivers of the Peninsular India. First statement is incorrect because the Kaveri is the most southerly, but River Krishna is the second largest east flowing system of the peninsular region. Second statement is correct because of a long rainy season in its basin; the Cauvery is the least seasonal among all the rivers of the peninsular region. Kaveri River originates at Talakaveri, Kodagu in Karnataka. It flows south and east through Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and across the southern Deccan plateau through Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, emptying into the Bay of Bengal through two principal mouths in Poompuhar in Tamil Nadu."
