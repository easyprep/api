  "question": "Keeladi, which is in news recently, is the historical site of which state?",
  "option1": "Kerala",
  "option2": "Tamil Nadu",
  "option3": "Karnataka",
  "option4": "Andhra Pradesh",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Tamil Nadu",
  "explanation": "The report titled, ‘Keeladi-An Urban Settlement of Sangam Age on the Banks of River Vaigai’ has recently published by the Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department (TNAD). The report is the major turning point in the cultural historiography of the ancient Sangam Age, which is generally considered between 300 BC and 300AD. In it, TNAD stated that the cultural deposits unearthed during excavations at Keeladi in Sivaganga district could be safely dated to a period between 6th century BCE and 1st century CE. Hence, the recent scientific dates obtained for Keeladi findings push back the date of Tamil-Brahmi script to another century, i.e. 6th century BCE."
