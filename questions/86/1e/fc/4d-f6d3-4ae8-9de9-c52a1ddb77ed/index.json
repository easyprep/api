  "question": "What is dry ice?",
  "option1": "Liquid nitrogen",
  "option2": "Water ice",
  "option3": "Solid carbon dioxide",
  "option4": "Frozen ethanol",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Solid carbon dioxide",
  "explanation": "\"Dry ice\" is solid carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon dioxide freezes at -78.5 degrees Centigrade. When dry ice \"melts\" it undergoes a process called sublimation. This means that it is converted from a solid directly to a gas, bypassing the intermediate liquid stage. This is where the name \"dry ice\" comes from - when it melts, you never get any liquid, hence it's \"dry\"."
