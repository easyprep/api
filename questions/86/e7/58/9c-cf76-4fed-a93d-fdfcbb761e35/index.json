  "question": "Which of the following banks has become the first Destination Bank to launch debit card-based e-mandate on NPCI’s API platform?",
  "option1": "ICICI Bank",
  "option2": "Kotak Mahindra Bank",
  "option3": "HDFC Bank",
  "option4": "Axis Bank",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Kotak Mahindra Bank",
  "explanation": "The Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) has become the first Destination Bank to go live with Net Banking and Debit Card-based authentication solution on NPCI’s e-Mandate API platform. The facility will enable its customers to create electronic mandates (similar to the erstwhile eNACH with Aadhaar + OTP) via both the Debit Card and Net Banking channels. This allows Kotak to go live as a sponsor or acquirer bank for corporates and merchants seeking recurring payments. In a first-of-its-kind initiative in the industry, customers can register both physical and e-mandates on a single platform with validation on the mandate fields to remove rejections on account of various reasons."
