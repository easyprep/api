  "question": "Consider the following statements about the Samba rice variety, which was frequently in news: <ol> <li>This rice variety is grown extensively in the north-eastern states of India</li> <li>It is known for shorter growing season in comparison to other rice varieties</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "First statement is incorrect because samba rice is grown extensively in Tamil Nadu. Second statement is again incorrect because this rice is grown for a longer duration or is a long-duration rice variety compared to other types of rice. It was recently in news when the Supreme Court directed Karnataka state government to release 15,000 cusecs of Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu for 10 days in an attempt to save the samba crops."
