  "answer": "El Salvador",
  "explanation": "Tazumal archaeological site is located in the city of Chalchuapa, Santa Ana, San Salvador, El Salvador. The area of Chalchuapa constitutes an archaeological zone integrated by several recognized sites, such as Tazumal, Casa Blanca, El Trapiche and the Laguna de Cuscachapa. The occupation of Tazumal took place from 1200 B.C. Its largest structure measures 24 meters in height, has twelve steps or platforms, and tombs with more than 116 vessels, jade jewellery, “mirrors” of iron pyrite, ball game devices and ceramics in the shape of lizards were found in the site. Also, the Stone of the Victories is found in Tazumal, which consists of a monolith of Olmec influence that presents four different petro-engravings on its four sides, dated around 700 B.C. Among the most important findings of Tazumal is the Virgin of Tazumal, which was found in 1892 by the historian Santiago Barberena, who moved it to the National Museum; and, the so-called Chac-Mool, which was found in the now called Laguna Seca de Chalchuapa."
