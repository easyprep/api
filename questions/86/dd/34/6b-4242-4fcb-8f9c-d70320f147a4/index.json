  "explanation": "Shibaji Banerjee (68), the former Mohun Bagan and India national team goalkeeper, has recently passed away in Kolkata, West Bengal. He played for Mohun Bagan for 11 years and was famous for saving penalty-kicks. He is considered to be one of Indiaâ€™s best shot-stoppers when it came to penalty-kicks. His most memorable performance in a tie-breaker was against Mohammedan Sporting in the 1980 Federation Cup semi-final when he stopped spot-kicks from Akbar and Amalraj. Banerjee is best remembered for his performance against New York Cosmos in 1977, which had the Brazilian legend Pele in their ranks. His diving save from Pele in the first half is one of the most-talked about moments in Indian football and has become a part of the folklore."
