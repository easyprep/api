  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Tamil Nadu",
  "explanation": "Two well-known products from Tamil Nadu — the Dindigul lock and the Kandangi saree  — have been given the Geographical Indication (GI) tag by The Geographical Indications Registry in Chennai. The lock is known throughout the world for its superior quality and durability,  even the city is called Lock City. The Government institutions such as prisons, godowns, hospitals, and even temples use these locks instead of other machine-made ones. The abundance of iron in this region is the reason for the growth of the lock-making industry.  The Kandangi sarees are manufactured in the entire Karaikudi taluk in Sivaganga district. They are characterised by large contrast borders and some are known to have borders covering as far as two-thirds of the saree which is usually around 5.10 m-5.60 m in length. These cotton sarees are worn in summer & usually bought by customers in bulk."
