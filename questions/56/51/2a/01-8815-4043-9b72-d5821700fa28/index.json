  "explanation": "Allan Octavian Hume ( popularly known as A. O. Hume) was a well known political reformer and a civil servant during the rule of British Empire in India. In 1885, the Indian National Congress (INC) was founded by him to create a platform which was under the supervision of the British and which should let the British government know the demands of the Indian people. To prevent another nationwide outbreak like the one that took place in 1857, the INC came into existence and in the beginning the leaders of that organisation were loyal to the British Crown."
