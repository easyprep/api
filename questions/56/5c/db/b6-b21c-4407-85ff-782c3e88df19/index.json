  "option1": "Capillary action",
  "option2": "Bernoulli's Principle",
  "option3": "Pascal's Law",
  "option4": "Stoke's Law",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Bernoulli's Principle",
  "explanation": "When we press the top of bottle the pressure at top of the bottle decreases and hence, the velocity of liquid flow increases. Bernoulliâ€™s Principle states that an increase in the speed of a fluid produces a decrease in pressure and that a decrease in the speed of a fluid produces an increase in pressure. The principle states that the total energy of a moving fluid remains constant at all times."
