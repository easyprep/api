  "question": "&nbsp; &nbsp;Consider the following statements about the ocean currents: <ol> <li>While the ocean currents in northern hemisphere move in clockwise direction, those in southern hemisphere move in counter clockwise direction</li> <li>While ocean currents on the eastern side of the continents are warm currents, ocean currents on the western side of the continent are cold currents</li> </ol> &nbsp; &nbsp; Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Both are correct statements<br> Ocean currents are fast flowing broad stream of water which moves in specific direction. While the ocean currents in northern hemisphere move in clockwise direction, those in southern hemisphere move in counter clockwise direction. While ocean currents on the eastern side of the continents are warm currents, ocean currents on the western side of the continent are cold currents. The Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic and the Kuroshio&nbsp;Current&nbsp;in the North Pacific are&nbsp;examples&nbsp;of warm currents.&nbsp;Labrador&nbsp;Current and Benguela current are examples of cold currents."
