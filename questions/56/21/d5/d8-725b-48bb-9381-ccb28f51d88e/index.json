  "answer": "Environmental determinism",
  "explanation": "Environmental determinism is the belief that the environment and its physical factors like landforms, climate, mountains etc. determines the patterns of human culture and societal development.\r\nPossibilism based upon the assumption that environment sets certain constraints or limitations, but culture is otherwise determined by social conditions. This theory says that the true and only geographical problem is that to utilisation of possibilities.\r\nNondeterminism or stop and go determinism which chooses middle path and it is introduced by Griffith Taylor."
