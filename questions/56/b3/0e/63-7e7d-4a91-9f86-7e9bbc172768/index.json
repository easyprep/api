  "answer": "Radioactivity",
  "explanation": "Marie Sklodowska Curie, born Maria Salomea Sklodowska, was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. As part of the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes, she was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and the only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two scientific fields. She was also the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris. She shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre Curie and physicist Henri Becquerel, for their pioneering work developing the theory of \"radioactivity\" (a term she coined). Using techniques she invented for isolating radioactive isotopes, she won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of two elements, polonium and radium."
