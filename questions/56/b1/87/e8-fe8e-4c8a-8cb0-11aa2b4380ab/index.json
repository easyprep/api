  "option1": "Andaman and Nicobar Islands",
  "option2": "Lakshadweep",
  "option3": "Karnataka",
  "option4": "Andhra Pradesh",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Lakshadweep",
  "explanation": "India\\'s first runway on \\'Sea Bridge\\' will come up in Lakshadweep because the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has recently got a green nod to extend Lakshadweepâ€™s Agatti Airport. The task will be carried out by building an RCC platform on the beach and shallow area which will allow bigger ATRs to operate on the island. The entire project is likely to cost about Rs 1,500 crore. The move will allow ATR-72 aircraft to land comfortably."
