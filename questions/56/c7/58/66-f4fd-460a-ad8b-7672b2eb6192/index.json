  "option1": "England",
  "option2": "New Zealand",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Australia",
  "explanation": "Australia won the Women's Cricket World Cup the most number of times. The eleven World Cups played to date have been held in five countries, with India and England having hosted the event three times. Australia is the most successful team, having won six titles and failed to make the final on only three occasions. England got four titles and New Zealand got one title. Therefore Australia, England and New Zealand are the only three teams to have won the event, while India, on twice and the West Indies, on once, have each reached the final without going on to win."
