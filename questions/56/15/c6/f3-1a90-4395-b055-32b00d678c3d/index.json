  "answer": "The Shukarchakia Misal",
  "explanation": "In 1767, the Sikhs declared independence in the area located between Rawalpindi and Yamuna river. But they failed to set up any united province in Punjab. That is why they got separated into 12 Misls i.e., Phulkian Misl, Ahluwalia Misl, Bhangi Misl, Kanheya Misl, Ramgarhia Misl, Singhpuria Misl, Panjgarhia Misl, Nishanwalia Misl, Sukerchakia Misl, Dallewalia Misl, Nakai Misl, Shaheedan Misl. The Ancestors of Maharaja Ranjit Singh were from Sukerchakia Misl. Ranjit Singh was the last Misldar and he established an independent kingdom in Punjab."
