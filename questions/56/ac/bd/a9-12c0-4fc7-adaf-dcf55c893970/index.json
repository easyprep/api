  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Universal Product Code consists of a unique 12 digit code for identifying a product and its related information like price. It was developed by George Laurer from the ideas of Norman Joseph Woodland. It is used by supermarkets and other large retailers for faster identification of prices and billing process.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe UPC is used as a 1D barcode variant. It is ‘read’ using a special optical scanning device called the ‘barcode reader’. The 2D variants are called matrix codes. These are usually read using apps and cameras on mobile phones."
