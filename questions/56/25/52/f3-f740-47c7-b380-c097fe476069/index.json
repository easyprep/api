  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "Third statement is incorrect because there are some relaxations from SEBI regulations, but it does not bring the acquired shares outside SEBI regulations. The scheme allows creditor banks to convert their unpaid loans to equity of troubled firms."
