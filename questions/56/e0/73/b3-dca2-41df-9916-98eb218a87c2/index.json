  "explanation": "Recently, NTPC started the power generation from India&rsquo;s largest floating solar power plant at Kayamkulam in Kerala. Kerala was chosen for the installation due to abundant availability of water bodies and lack of enough land.&nbsp;The 100 kWp floating solar generation plant is the largest of its kind in India, and was indigenously developed as a part of &lsquo;Make in India&rsquo; initiative, at Rajiv Gandhi Combined Cycle Power Plant (RGCCPP) in Kerala&rsquo;s Kayamkulam district. Solar panels mounted on floating boards hold them in place saves land usage. The solar panels in water have been found to be efficient than the ones installed on land.&nbsp;These floating platforms were indigenously developed by NTPC Energy Technology Research Alliance, the R&amp;D arm of NTPC Ltd BSE -0.30 %, in collaboration with Central Institute of Plastic Engineering &amp; Technology (CIPET), Chennai and a patent has been applied for.&nbsp;"
