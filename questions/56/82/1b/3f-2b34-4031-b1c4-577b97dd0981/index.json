  "question": "Which state will have India's first Eco-friendly bridges for the movement of tigers?",
  "option1": "Telangana",
  "option2": "Andhra Pradesh",
  "option3": "Odisha",
  "option4": "Assam",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Telangana",
  "explanation": "In a first of its kind, Telangana State will have eco-friendly bridges over a canal cutting across the tiger corridor linking the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) in the Chandrapur district of Maharashtra with the forests in Telangana\\'s Kumram Bheem Asifabad district. It requires the laying of fertile soil to grow grass and plants over the structure, so that fragmentation of the reserve forest is camouflaged. The ‘eco-bridges’ will be constructed at key spots along the 72 km-long, and at some places over a kilometre wide, right flank canal of the Pranahita barrage in the Bejjur and Dahegaon mandals."
