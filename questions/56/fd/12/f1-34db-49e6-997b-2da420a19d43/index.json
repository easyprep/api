  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Russia",
  "explanation": "The world's first hybrid \\\"aeroboat\\\" capable of travelling on land, water, snow and sand that has been built by an Indo-Russian joint venture. It has been designed by IIAAT Holding, a joint venture between the International Institute for Advanced Aerospace Technologies and Indian firm Millennium Aerodynamics. The aeroboat is capable to access difficult terrain, such as flooded or marshy areas where the use of regular boats is not possible due to shallow water, patches of dry land or by marine vegetation. These are much faster and more robust than the comparable hovercrafts."
