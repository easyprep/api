  "answer": "To decrease the alkalinity",
  "explanation": "Gypsum is calcium sulfate. It is a naturally occurring mineral. It has been touted as beneficial for breaking up compact soil, especially clay soil. It is useful in changing the soil structure of excessively heavy soils which have been impacted by heavy traffic, flooding, over cropping, or simply overly weatherized. It decreases their alkalinity."
