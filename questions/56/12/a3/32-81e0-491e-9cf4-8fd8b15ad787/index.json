  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "In economics, deflation is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services. Deflation occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0% (a negative inflation rate). This should not be confused with disinflation, a slow-down in the inflation rate (i.e. when inflation declines to lower levels) Inflation reduces the real value of money over time; conversely, deflation increases the real value of money â€“ the currency of a national or regional economy. This allows one to buy more goods with the same amount of money over time."
