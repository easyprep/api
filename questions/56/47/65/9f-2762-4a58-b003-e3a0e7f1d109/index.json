  "answer": "Metrolite",
  "explanation": "The Union Government has proposed light urban rail transit system - \\'Metrolite\\' - in small cities and towns having lower projection of ridership, with each train having three coaches and a restricted speed of 25 kmph.  The \\'Metrolite\\' can be developed at a lower cost in comparison with existing metro system & will also act as feeder system to high capacity Metro. The three-coach train will have capacity of carrying 300 passengers. Sources said the government would provide financial assistance to states to implement the light urban rail transit system. It will have a dedicated path separating the road traffic with it. For segregation with road traffic, fencing can be provided on either side of network. The \\'Metrolite\\' system will have shelter platforms. Metrolite platforms will not have AFC gates, platform screen doors, X-ray and baggage scanner. The \\'Metrolite\\' train will comprise three non-separable coaches with low floor height of about 300-350 mm. Unit length should be of minimum 33 m. The car structure material will be stainless steel or aluminium."
