  "question": "Recently, the Union Environment Ministry notified the new Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rules 2017. In this context, consider the following statements: <ol> <li>Under new rules, the central government has tried to take away powers previously delegated to state governments for wetland management</li> <li>The new rules replace the Central Wetlands Regulatory Authority (CWRA) by a National Wetlands Committee (NWC) headed by the Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because the new rules envisage setting up of a State Wetlands Authority in each State and union territories that will be headed by the Stateâ€™s environment minister for wetland management. Thus, under the new rules, the powers have been delegated to the State governments so that protection and conservation work can be done at the local level. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u> because the proposed National Wetlands Committee will be headed by the MoEFCC Secretary and not by the Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change."
