  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Manpower is also an important factor of production in the manufacturing activity.<br />For the manufacturing activity, both cost and availability of labour are important. It is felt that a skilled and cheap labour force is capable of attracting manufacturing activity in a particular region. <br />The mobility of labour is a factor contributing to dispersal of industry while a labour force with no mobility and a high degree of specialisation may cause a particular type of industry to concentrate in a particular region."
