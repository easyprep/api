Governor of Punjab at the time of the Jalliawala Bagh massacre<br />• People in Punjab were made to crawl on the streets. They were put in open cages and flogged<br />• Newspapers were banned and their editors put behind the bars or deported<br />• Rabindranath Tagore, who had been knighted by the British, renounced his knighthood<br />It was clear that the brutalities had only added fuel to the fire and made the people’s determination stronger to fight for their freedom and against oppression."
