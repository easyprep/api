  "question": "The sum of money that yields a compound interest on 420 Rs. during the second year at 5% per annum is :",
  "option1": "4000 Rs.",
  "option2": "4200 Rs.",
  "option3": "2100 Rs.",
  "option4": "8000 Rs",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "8000 Rs",
  "explanation": "$latex CI = P\\\\left [ \\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{R}{100} \\\\right )^{T}-1 \\\\right ] - \\\\frac{PR}{100}&s=1$\r\n$latex => 420 = P \\\\left [ \\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{5}{100} \\\\right )^{2}-1 \\\\right ] - \\\\frac{P\\\\times 5}{100}&s=1$\r\n$latex => 420 = P \\\\left [ \\\\left ( \\\\frac{21}{20} \\\\right )^{2}-1 \\\\right ]-\\\\frac{5P}{100}&s=1$\r\n$latex => 420 = \\\\frac{41P}{400}-\\\\frac{5P}{100} = \\\\frac{21P}{400}&s=1$\r\n$latex => P = \\\\frac{420\\\\times 400}{21} = 8000\\\\ Rs.&s=1$\r\nHence option [D] is correct answer."
