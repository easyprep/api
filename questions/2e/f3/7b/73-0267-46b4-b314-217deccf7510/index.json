  "question": "A tap can fill a cistern in 8 hours and another tap can empty it in 16 hours. If both the taps are open, the time (in hours) taken to fill the tank will be:",
  "option1": "24 hours",
  "option2": "16 hours",
  "option3": "10 hours",
  "option4": "8 hours",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "16 hours",
  "explanation": "Part of the cistern filled in 1 hour = 1$latex \\\\div$8\r\nPart of the cistern emptied in 1 hour = 1$latex \\\\div$16\r\nWhen both the taps are opened simultaneously, part of cistern fill in 1 hour = $latex \\\\frac{1}{8}-\\\\frac{1}{16}=\\\\frac{2-1}{16}=\\\\frac{1}{16}&s=1$\r\nHence, the cisatern wil be filled in 16 hours.\r\nSo option [B] is the right answer."
