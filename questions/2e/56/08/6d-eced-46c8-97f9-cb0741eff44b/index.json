  "question": "Which of the following make rain bearing clouds appear dark?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Rayleigh scattering</li>\r\n<li>Tyndall effect</li>\r\n<li>High density of clouds</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "The rain bearing clouds — the nimbostratus and stratus clouds — are dark in colour. There are two main reasons: 1. Part of Light is scattered by the tiny droplets of water in clouds 2. Part of Light is absorbed by the tiny droplets of water in clouds. The high density and thickness of rain clouds cause them to appear black because it doesn’t allow much of the light to pass through."
