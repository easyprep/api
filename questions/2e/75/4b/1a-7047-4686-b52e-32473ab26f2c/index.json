  "explanation": "<strong>It is an initiative under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment</strong> <u>This statement is incorrect</u>. The Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana (PMVVY) is a pension scheme announced under the Ministry of Finance. <strong>The scheme aims to provide social security to elderly persons aged 60 and above </strong> This is correct statement. The scheme aims to provide social security to elderly people aged 6o and above against a future fall in their interest income due to uncertain market conditions. The scheme enables old age income security for senior citizens through provision of assured pension/return linked to the subscription amount based on government guarantee to Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). The scheme provides an assured return of 8% per annum for 10 years. The salient features of the scheme are: <ul> <li>Scheme provides an assured return of 8% p.a. payable monthly (equivalent to 8.30% p.a. effective) for 10 years.</li> <li>Pension is payable at the end of each period, during the policy term of 10 years, as per the frequency of monthly/ quarterly/ half-yearly/ yearly as chosen by the pensioner at the time of purchase.</li> <li>The scheme is exempted from Service Tax/ GST.</li> <li>On survival of the pensioner to the end of the policy term of 10 years, Purchase price along with final pension instalment shall be payable.</li> <li>Loan upto 75% of Purchase Price shall be allowed after 3 policy years (to meet the liquidity needs). Loan interest shall be recovered from the pension instalments and loan to be recovered from claim proceeds.</li> </ul> The scheme also allows for premature exit for the treatment of any critical/ terminal illness of self or spouse. On such premature exit, 98% of the Purchase Price shall be refunded. On death of the pensioner during the policy term of 10 years, the Purchase Price shall be paid to the beneficiary."
