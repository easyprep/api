  "question": "Which Institution has recently developed a new paper-based sensor to make assessment of freshness of milk?",
  "option1": "CSIR",
  "option2": "NEERI",
  "option3": "DRDO",
  "option4": "IIT-GUWAHATI",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "IIT-GUWAHATI",
  "explanation": "The IIT-Guwahati on November 13, 2019 has developed paper-based sensor to make assessment of freshness of milk by simple and instantaneous method. The method can be used to check the quality of milk at the point of milk collection ans also in home kitchens.<br />The method detects quantity of ALP (Alkaline Phosphate) in the milk to determine its freshness and quality. ALP is a metalloprotein found in raw milk samples. It is an important bio marker in quality control in milk. The ALP compounds are destroyed during pasteurization. Therefore, detecting ALP compounds can help in detecting inadequate pasteurization in milk."
