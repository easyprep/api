  "answer": "Azerbaijan and Georgia",
  "explanation": "Azerbaijan and Georgia are the basin countries of the Alazani River. The Alazani is a river that flows through the Caucasus. It is the main tributary of the Kura in eastern Georgia and flows for 351 kilometres. Part of its path forms the border between Georgia and Azerbaijan before it meets the Kura at the Mingachevir Reservoir. The Alazani originates in the Greater Caucasus, south of the main ridge, in the northwestern part of the Akhmeta District. It flows initially to the south towards the town Akhmeta, then through the fruitful Alazani Valley of Kakheti towards the southeast. The Alazani is the centre of the Georgian wine industry. For centuries, it was the main gateway for Persian invaders."
