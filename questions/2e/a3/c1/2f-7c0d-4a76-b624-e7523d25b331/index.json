  "question": "In context with the recent studies highlighting the effects of upside-down rivers in Antarctica, consider the following statements about Thwaites Glacier:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is located in east Antarctica region.</li>\n<li>It is the fastest melting glacier of the continent.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Thwaites Glacier is a part of West Antarctica Ice Sheet. It is a fast moving glacier with its surface speeds reaching about 2km per year. Recent studies show that upside-down rivers are speeding up the melting of this glacier.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Pine Island Glacier is the fastest melting glacier in Antarctica. Thwaites Glacier is also melting at a significant speed. It forms the ‘weak underbelly’ of West Antarctic Ice Sheet. It is being kept under watch because of its significant vulnerability to raising temperatures."
