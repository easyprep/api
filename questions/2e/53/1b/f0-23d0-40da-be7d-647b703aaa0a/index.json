  "question": "According to the India Meteorological Department's (IMD's) Statement on Climate of India During 2019 report, Arabian Sea on India's west coast saw a 400% rise in cyclones, a record that is repeated only after 1902. Which five cyclones hit Arabian Sea in 2019?",
  "option1": "Vayu, Pabuk, Kyarr, Bulbul and Pavan",
  "option2": "Vayu, Pabuk, Kyarr, Bulbul and Fani",
  "option3": "Pabuk,Vayu, Kyarr, Bulbul and Fani",
  "option4": "Vayu, Hikka, Kyarr, Maha and Pavan",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Vayu, Hikka, Kyarr, Maha and Pavan",
  "explanation": "According to the India Meteorological Department's (IMD's) Statement on Climate of India During 2019 report, the number of cyclones in the Arabian Sea was 400% higher than normal frequency because five out of eight cyclones affected Arabian Sea. These give cyclones were Vayu, Hikka, Kyarr, Maha and Pavan. This after the sea on India's west coast normally undergoes only one cyclone annually — read a 400% rise. (India normally has five cyclones in total every year.) However, the Bay of Bengal — usually the more cyclone-prone coast of India — was relatively subdued in 2019 with three (Pabuk, Fani, Bulbul) instead of four cyclones that occur there annually on an average."
