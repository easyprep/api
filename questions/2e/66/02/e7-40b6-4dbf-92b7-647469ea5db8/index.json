  "explanation": "The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has inscribed Colombia\\'s Chiribiquete National Park (CNP) on its list of world heritage sites. The park, which straddles the southern provinces of Caquet√° and Guaviare, is the country\\'s largest and has one of the highest rates of plant diversity in the northern Amazon. It is also famous for its table-top rock formations known as tepuis, which rise out of the forest. The national park was established on September 1989, after hundreds of rock paintings dating as far back as 18,000 years BCE were discovered on the vertical rock faces of the area. It is the ninth site in Colombia to be given world heritage status."
