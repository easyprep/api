The revolution was initially aimed at overthrowing King Farouk. However, the movement had more political ambitions and soon moved to abolish the constitutional monarchy and aristocracy of Egypt and Sudan, establish a republic, end the British occupation of the country, and secure the independence of Sudan (previously governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium). The revolutionary government adopted a staunchly nationalist, anti-imperialist agenda, which came to be expressed chiefly through Arab nationalism, and international non-alignment. The result of this revolution was that end of the rule of the Muhammad Ali dynasty, the establishment of the Republic of Egypt, end of British occupation of Egypt, beginning of the Nasser era, revolutionary wave across the Arab world, beginning of the Arab Cold War."
