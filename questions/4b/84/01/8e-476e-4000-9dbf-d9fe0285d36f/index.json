  "question": "Excessive accumulation of Nitrogen and Phosphorous in the water helps in growth of which of the following?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Phytoplankton</li>\r\n<li>Zooplankton</li>\r\n<li>Fish</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "First option (Phytoplankton) is correct but second and third will not be correct and want you to think about eutrophication. Phosphorus stimulates the growth of algae in slow moving water. These algae eventually die and decompose, removing the oxygen from the water. This process is called eutrophication. This leads to killing of fish and other fauna and drastic fall in fish population."
