  "option1": "trade-distorting subsidies",
  "option2": "agreement on services",
  "option3": "agreement on intellectual property",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "trade-distorting subsidies",
  "explanation": "Doha round of negotiations has remained stalled since 2008, primarily over the issue of huge trade-distorting subsidies being given to farmers by the rich countries. The fundamental objective of the DDA was to improve trading prospects for developing nations. It included issues such as agriculture, greater market access in industrial products, enhanced foreign direct investments, regulations relating to services trade, trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, rules on anti-dumping, subsidies and trade facilitation. While India and other developing nations want a reaffirmation to conclude the DDA first, developed countries seek to mostly dilute the negotiations and widen the mandate with new issues, including e-commerce and global value chain."
