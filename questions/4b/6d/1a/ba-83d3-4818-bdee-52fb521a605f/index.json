  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "In the Government of India Act 1919, it was laid down that after a period of about 10 years, a commission would arrive in India to find out how far the reforms introduced by the act of 1919 were successful and what new reforms it needed. The Simon commission had no non-white members and this was the major reason that it was opposed. It made all the recommendations for abolition of Dyarchy and introduction of complete provincial autonomy. However, Simon Commission did not propose any change in Central structure."
