  "question": "You arrive at your school 5 minutes late if you walk with a speed of 4 km/hr, but you arrive 10 minutes before the scheduled time if you walk with a speed of 5 km/hr. The distance of your school from your house is :",
  "option1": "2 km",
  "option2": "4 km",
  "option3": "5 km",
  "option4": "10 km",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "5 km",
  "explanation": "If the required distance be x km, then\r\n$latex \\\\frac{x}{4} - \\\\frac{x}{5} = \\\\frac{10+5}{60}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{5x - 4x}{20} = \\\\frac{1}{4}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{x}{20} = \\\\frac{1}{4}&s=1$\r\n$latex => x = \\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\times 20 = 5\\\\ km&s=1$\r\nHence option [C] is correct answer."
