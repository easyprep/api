  "option1": "1 only",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "2 only",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 only",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe Repealing and Amendment Bill, 2019 seeks to repeal 68 acts in whole while making amendments to several other acts. The acts were listed for elimination given their irrelevance to the current functioning of the country. The Beedi workers welfare fund act, 1976, had set up a fund for beedi workers for improving health, water supply, education, sanitation, housing etc.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe bill only amends the provisions of Indian Institute of Management act, 2017. The 2017 act declares all the 20 IIMs in India as Institutes of National Importance. It also dictates the various provisions governing these bodies like the board of governors, issuance of degrees, etc. Another act it amends is the Income Tax act of 1961.Â \n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe bill does not amend but repeals the Motor Vehicles (amendment) Act, 2001. The 2001 amendment was targeted at an earlier 1988 act. It targeted issues like taxi aggregators, third party insurance, road safety etc. The Parliament is also complementing the move with the passage of the Motor Vehicles Amendment Bill, 2019."
