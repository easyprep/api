  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Steam coal &#8211; also known as thermal coal &#8211; is mainly used in power generation. Coking coal &#8211; also known as metallurgical coal &#8211; is mainly used in steel production. Coking coal is defined as a hard coal with a quality that allows the production of coke oven coke suitable to support a blast furnace charge. Traditionally, coking coals command a price premium over steam coals reflecting a higher carbon. Coke has a higher heat value than coal itself, and can therefore be used to generate the extremely high temperatures (up to 4000Â°F) required for metal refining (particularly steelmaking). In addition to providing the heat, coke acts as a chemical reducing agent to produce pure iron from molten iron ore in a blast furnace."
