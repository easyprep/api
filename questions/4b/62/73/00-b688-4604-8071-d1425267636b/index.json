  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "Gandhi had not called the ali brothers to launch Khilafat Movement. First the leaders met, then Published their Khilafat manifesto and after only that there was a unwritten pact between INC and Khilafat Movement to work and cooperate on agitation. Gandhi gave them a call to participate in NCM, because he (Gandhi) thought that it was only remedy for British. Thus only 1 stands correct in this question."
