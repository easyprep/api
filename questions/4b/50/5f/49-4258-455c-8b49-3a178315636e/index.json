  "answer": "Trade Marks Act, 1999",
  "explanation": "The iconic Taj Mahal Palace hotel of Mumbai has acquired an `image trademarkâ€™ under the Trademark Act of 1999. Thus, the Palace has become the first building in India to get intellectual property rights protection for its architectural design. Now, it is will be difficult to use Taj Mahal Palace\\'s images for commercial purposes without paying the company a licensing fee. Though, it does not prevent locals and tourists from clicking pictures of the iconic building as long as it is not sold for commercial benefits. The Trade Marks Act of 1999 is the current governing law relating to registered trademarks which replaced The Trade and Merchandise Marks Act of 1958.The act enables to deal with the precise nature of rights which a person can acquire in respect of trademarks."
