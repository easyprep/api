  "question": "The Trans-fats cause problems in human body because__:",
  "option1": "The fat molecules contain high energy that cause oxidation of the tissues",
  "option2": "The structure of the fat molecules is such that more molecules can fit in lesser space",
  "option3": "The fat molecules contain lesser energy and can not be used so easily",
  "option4": "None of the above reasons",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "The structure of the fat molecules is such that more molecules can fit in lesser space",
  "explanation": "Trans unsaturated fats are particularly risky because the double bond stereochemistry allows the fat molecules to assume a linear conformation, which leads to efficient packing (i.e., plaque formation)."
