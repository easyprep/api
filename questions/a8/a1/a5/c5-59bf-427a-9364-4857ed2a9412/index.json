  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nYubi lakpi is a traditional football game of Manipur. It i\\\\resembles modern day rugby in many aspects. It literally means coconut snatching. It is played with an oiled coconut. The players themselves are covered with oil to slip past opponents easily.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nIt is not a team sport. Each player looks to score points using the oiled coconut by evading others. Like rugby, the yubi lakpi involves the use of a goal line which the player has to get past with the coconut to score a point."
