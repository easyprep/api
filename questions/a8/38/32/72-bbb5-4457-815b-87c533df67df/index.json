It holds 1/5<sup>th</sup> of the world’s proven oil reserves. The country’s GDP is highly dependent on its oil exports. It is the largest oil exporter.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nUSA had set up its Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1975 after the disruption faced by it because of oil embargo. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act led to the establishment of the reserve sites at several places. The reserve has over 644 million barrels of oil. Presidential permission is required to draw from it.\n<strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong>\nCurrently, India has strategic petroleum reserves at three places in South India. These are in Visakhapatnam, Mangalore and Padur. The government had announced two more such sites to be set up in Odisha’s Jaipur and Rajasthan’s Bikaner. These fall under the purview of ministry of petroleum and natural gas.\n&nbsp;"
