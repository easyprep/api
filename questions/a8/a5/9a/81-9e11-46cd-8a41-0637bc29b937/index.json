The Gurmukhī script was developed from Śāradā by Guru Angad. Originally more widespread, its use became later restricted to Kashmir, and it is now rarely used except by the Kashmiri Pandit community for ceremonial purposes. There are several variants of Śāradā Scripts such as Takkari or Tankari which is the parent of the Dogri script, Kului script (Kullu in Himachal Pradesh), Chameali Script (in Chamba Himachal Pradesh), Sindhi, Bania of Punjab etc."
