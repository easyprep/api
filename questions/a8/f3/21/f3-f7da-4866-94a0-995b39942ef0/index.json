  "question": "&nbsp; &nbsp; Consider the following pairs: <ol> <li>Strontium carbonate -  Red fireworks</li> <li>Barium chloride -  Green fireworks</li> <li>Copper chloride -  Blue fireworks</li> <li>Sodium nitrate -  Yellow fireworks&nbsp;</li> </ol> &nbsp; Which of the above are correct?",
  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "All given pairs are correctly matched<br> Pyrotechnic&nbsp;Stars&nbsp;are pellets or simply a composition&nbsp;of metal salts that are packed into a firework as pea. The concoction of metals generally consists of potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulphur. Different metal salts are responsible for different colours. For example, strontium carbonate (red fireworks), calcium chloride (orange fireworks), sodium nitrate (yellow fireworks), barium chloride (green fireworks) and copper chloride (blue fireworks). Purple fireworks are typically produced by use of a mixture of strontium (red) and copper (blue) compounds."
