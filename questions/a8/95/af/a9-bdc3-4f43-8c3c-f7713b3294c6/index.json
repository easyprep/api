  "explanation": "The International Domestic Workers Day (IDWD) is celebrated every year across the world on June 16 to assert the rights of this vast but hidden workforce. On this day in 2011, IDWD was declared to commemorate the adoption of International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention C189. C189 set labour standards for domestic workers such as rest hours, wages, min age, and living arrangements. So far, 25 countries ratified the convention, recognizing millions of domestic workers and giving them a voice to advocate for their rights. According to the ILO, there are around 53 million domestic workers worldwide, 83% of whom are women. In India, 3 out of 5 domestic workers are women."
