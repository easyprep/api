  "question": "With respect to the physics involved in playing of flute, consider the following observations:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>A flute player changes the pitch of the sound produced by opening and closing holes in the body of the flute</li>\r\n<li>Opening and closing of holes in the body of flute changes resonant frequency</li>\r\n<li>The pitch of the sound produced by Flute cannot be changed without opening and closing holes in the body of the flute.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is/ are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The first two statements are correct because the player changes the pitch of the sound produced by opening and closing holes in the body of the instrument, thus changing the effective length of the resonator and its corresponding resonant frequency. The third statement is incorrect because pitch can be changed via a change in air pressure also, so that air in the flute can resonate at a harmonic other than the fundamental frequency without opening or closing any holes."
