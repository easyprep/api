  "explanation": "The Finance Ministry recently announced that those companies with a turnover of over â‚¹50 crore and involved in only B2B (business to business) transactions are exempted from the mandatory requirement of accepting payments only by electronic modes like RuPay cards, BHIM-UPI or UPI-QR.\r\nSection 269SU was inserted in the Finance Act, 2019 to encourage digital transactions in the country, which mandated the businesses with sales/turn over above Rs 50 Crore to accept only e-payments. Since these e-payment has a maximum limit and the B2B businesses receive maximum payments through RTGS or NEFT, the exemption is cancelled."
