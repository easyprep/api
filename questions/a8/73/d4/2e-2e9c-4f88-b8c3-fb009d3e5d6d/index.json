  "question": "Which among the following term correctly represents the religious and belief systems in which items in nature such as animals, trees or mountains can have spiritual value?",
  "option1": "Animism",
  "option2": "Syncretic religion",
  "option3": "Tribalism",
  "option4": "Hybrid religion",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Animism",
  "explanation": "Animistic religions such as voodoun are based on items in nature having spiritual value. Syncretic religions are ones that have integrated the beliefs of two or more other religions. An example would be Sikhism, drawing from both Hinduism and Islam. Please don’t confuse with tribalism. Although many of the world’s tribal groups have animistic beliefs, they are identified as a social unit, not a religion. Hybrid religious practices can describe the syncretic or involve the worship of two or more religions simultaneously"
