  "question": "With reference to the recent discussions about the issue of sulphur pollution from shipping industry, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>India is signatory to the Marpol convention.</li>\n<li>The sulphur cap on fuel will apply from 2020 onwards.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Marpol Convention has been effective since 1983. It stands for Maritime Pollution convention and is also known as the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. India is a signatory of this convention. The International maritime Organisation issued regulations to curb sulphur emission in accordance with this convention.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Indian government is to impose a limit on the amount of sulphur that can be present in fuels from the 1<sup>st</sup> of January, 2020. The limit will be set at 0.50% m/m. this is because sulphur upon combustion of the fuel turns into sulphur dioxide which is injurious to health. The bunker oils in use today contain high sulphur content."
