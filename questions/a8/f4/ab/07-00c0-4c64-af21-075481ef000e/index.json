  "explanation": "The headquarters of the fashion house \"Chanel\" is located in Paris, the capital city of France. Chanel is a French fashion house that focuses on women's high fashion and ready-to-wear clothes, luxury goods and accessories. The company is owned by Alain Wertheimer and Gerard Wertheimer, grandsons of Pierre Wertheimer, who was an early business partner of the couturi√®re Coco Chanel. In her youth, Gabrielle Chanel gained the nickname \"Coco\" from her time as a chanteuse. As a fashion designer, Coco Chanel catered to women's taste for elegance in dress, with blouses and suits, trousers and dresses, and jewellery (gemstone and bijouterie) of simple design, that replaced the opulent, over-designed, and constrictive clothes and accessories of 19th-century fashion."
