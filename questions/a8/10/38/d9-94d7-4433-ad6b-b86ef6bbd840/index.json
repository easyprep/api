  "explanation": "As the name suggests, these funds take a contrarian view on equities. The fund manager picks underperforming stocks or sectors, which are likely to perform well in the long run, at cheap valuations. For instance, experts held a contrarian view on telecom stocks for a two-year period. These funds are mostly a part of the equity-diversified category. The difference lies in the style of investing. For instance, a strengthening rupee strains the margins of IT companies as their major business comes from the US. But, a contra fund manager would pick IT stocks and wait for the rupee to weaken. ING Contra, Kotak Contra, L&amp;T Contra, Magnum Contra, Religare Contra, Tata Contra and UTI Contra are some known contra funds."
