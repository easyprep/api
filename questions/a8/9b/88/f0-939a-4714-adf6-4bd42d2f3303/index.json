  "explanation": "• The Chittagong armoury raid was carried out on 18 April 1930. Kalpana joined the \\\"Indian Republican Army, Chattagram branch\\\", the armed resistance group led by Surya Sen in May 1931.<br />• Abhinav Bharat Society (Young India Society) was a secret society founded by Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and his brother Ganesh Damodar Savarkar in 1904.<br />• Anushilan Samiti was a Bengali Indian organisation that existed in the first quarter. It soon became an organ for the radical views of Aurobindo and Anushilan leaders, and lent the name \\\"Jugantar party\\\" to the Calcutta group.<br />• After Bhagat Jawarmal died, Balak Singh carried is legacy. However, it was not the real starting of the Kuka Movement as we know today. The real founder was Baba Ram Singh, who was born in 1815 as a son of a poor carpenter, in small village of Bhaini, around 7 kilometers away from Ludhiana."
