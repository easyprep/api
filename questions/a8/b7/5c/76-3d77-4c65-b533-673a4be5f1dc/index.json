The Guinness World Records officially recognised Nonaka as the world’s oldest living man after the death of 113-year old Spaniard Francisco Nunez Olivera in 2018. Nonaka was born on 25th July 1905, two years after the Wright Brothers launched the first power-driven flight and just months before Einstein published his theory of relativity. Japan has one of the world\\'s highest life expectancies and was home to several people recognised as among the oldest humans to have ever lived."
