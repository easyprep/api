  "explanation": "• African trypanosomiasis is also known as sleeping sickness. It is a disease spread by an infected tsetse fly, found in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Sleeping sickness is caused by two different parasites, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. <br />• Aedes aegypti is the yellow fever mosquito. It is a mosquito that can spread dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika fever, Mayaro and yellow fever viruses, and other disease agents. The mosquito can be recognized by white markings on its legs and a marking in the form of a lyre on the upper surface of its thorax.<br />• Schistosomiasis is also known as snail fever and bilharzias. It is a disease caused by parasitic flatworms called schistosomes or water snail.The urinary tract or the intestines may be infected. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, or blood in the urine.<br />• Kala azar is caused by bites from female phlebotomine sandflies – the vector of the leishmania parasite. The sand flies feed on animals and humans for blood, which they need for developing their eggs."
