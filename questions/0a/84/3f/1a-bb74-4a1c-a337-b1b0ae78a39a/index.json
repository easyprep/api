  "answer": "Austria, France, Germany, Slovenia, Italy, Switzerland",
  "explanation": "Austria, France, Germany, Slovenia, Italy, Switzerland are the six countries that share the location of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Prehistoric Pile Dwellings around the Alps\". The series of 111 out of the 937 known archaeological pile-dwelling sites in six countries around the Alpine and sub-alpine regions of Europe is composed of the remains of prehistoric settlements dating from 5,000 to 500 BC which are situated underwater, on lakeshores, along rivers or in wetlands. The exceptional conservation conditions for organic materials provided by the waterlogged sites, combined with extensive under-water archaeological investigations and research in many fields of natural science, such as archaeobotany and archaeozoology, over the past decades, has combined to present an outstanding detailed perception of the world of early agrarian societies in Europe. The precise information on their agriculture, animal husbandry, development of metallurgy, over a period of more than four millennia, coincides with one of the most important phases of recent human history: the dawn of modern societies."
