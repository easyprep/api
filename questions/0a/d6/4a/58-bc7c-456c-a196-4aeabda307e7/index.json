  "answer": "Brihaddeshi",
  "explanation": "In post Gupta period, a great treatise only after Natyashashtra was composed in Sanskrit as Brihaddeshi by Matanga Muni. Brihaddeshi is the first text that speaks about r?ga and distinguishes the music genres into Marga Sangeet (Classical Music) and Desi Sangeet (Folk Music). Brihaddeshi was also the important work on Indian music before the Islam came and influenced the Indian music. Brihaddeshi was based upon the Natyashashtra itself and has clarified many things which were unclear in the Bharataâ€™s text."
