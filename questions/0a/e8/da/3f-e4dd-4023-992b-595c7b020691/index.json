More common is heating milk up to at least 161.6 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 seconds. There are following methods that are most commonly used:<br />• High Temperature, Short Time (HTST) method – This method requires that the milk be held at 161 degrees for 16 seconds. <br />• Ultra-Pasteurization (UP) – This is the type of pasteurization that you will most commonly see on cartons of milk, half-and-half and heavy cream."
