  "question": "What field in which \"Lumiere Brothers\" are known for?",
  "option1": "Telephone",
  "option2": "Aeroplane",
  "option3": "Motion Picture",
  "option4": "Computer",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Motion Picture",
  "explanation": "The Lumiere brothers, Auguste Marie Louis Nicolas (19 October 1862 – 10 April 1954) and Louis Jean ( 5 October 1864 – 7 June 1948) were manufacturers of photography equipment, best known for their Cinematographe motion picture system and the short films they produced between 1895 and 1905. Their screening on 22 March 1895 for circa 200 members of the \"Society for the Development of the National Industry\" in Paris was probably the first presentation of films on a screen for a large audience. Their first commercial public screening on 28 December 1895 for circa 40 paying visitors and invited relations has traditionally been regarded as the birth of cinema. Either the techniques or the business models of earlier filmmakers proved to be less viable than the breakthrough presentations of the Lumieres."
