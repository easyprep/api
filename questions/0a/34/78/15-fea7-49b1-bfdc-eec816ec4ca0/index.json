  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe north-east monsoon is also known as the winter monsoon. It extends between October and December every year. During this period, the north-east trade winds blow from the land to the seas. Most of India remains dry during this season.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe north-east monsoon brings rain to parts of the Peninsular India like TN and countries down south, like Sri Lanka. 50 to 60% of rains in TN is from winter monsoon.
