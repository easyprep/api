  "answer": "1 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe Walvis Bay Port is located on the coast of Namibia. The African port is a natural deepwater harbour that has been historically coveted by many colonialists. The port was developed by China and Namibia to increase container capacity and improve the tourism in the region. It was built by Chinese company China Harbour Engineering Company.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe port is located along the western coast of Africa. It borders the Atlantic Ocean. It is found adjacent to the Cape of Good Hope. This makes a desirable geopolitical tool for many countries and had been the reason for their frequent change of ownership before becoming a part of Namibia.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe port was funded by the African development bank and the Namibian government. It took up 280 million USD for construction. It saw the reclamation of 40 hectares of land from the sea. It is to turn into an important logistics hub.\n&nbsp;"
