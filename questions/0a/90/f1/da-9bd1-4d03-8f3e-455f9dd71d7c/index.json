  "option5": "",
  "answer": 0.1,
  "explanation": "The Union cabinet has recently approved a 10% reservation in educational institutions and government jobs for  economically backward sections in the general category. The constitutional amendment bill will be tabled in Parliament on 8th January 2019, the last day of the Winter Session. The proposed reservation will be over and above the existing 50% reservation enjoyed by the Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) and the Other Backward Classes (OBCs), taking the total reservation to 60%. For this, the government will amend Articles 15 and 16 - which are on discrimination and equal opportunity - of the Constitution to implement it.  Among the major castes to benefit from the proposed law are Brahmins, Rajputs (Thakurs), Jats, Marathas, Bhumihars, several trading castes, Kapus and Kammas among other upper castes. It would also benefit the poor in other religions. The move is being seen as a step to consolidate upper caste votes just ahead of the general elections. Most Opposition parties called it an election gimmick but are not likely to oppose it."
