  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Black Hole",
  "explanation": "Astronomers at the Max Planck Institute of Germany have recently discovered a new black hole named Holmberg 15A that is clocking in at 40 billion times the mass of the Sun. The black hole is supergiant elliptical galaxy i.e. around 700 million light-years away from Earth and resides right at the centre of the Abell 85 galaxy cluster.  It is to be noted that the Holmberg 15A is one of the biggest black holes that’s ever been spotted by keeping track on the movement of stars around it.  Black holes are a region of space-time exhibiting gravitational acceleration so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it."
