  "question": "If a Candle is make to burn in Zero Gravity__:",
  "option1": "The Candle will burn for a very long time compared to normal gravity",
  "option2": "The flame of the candle will become round",
  "option3": "There is no impact of gravity on the burning of candle",
  "option4": "The Candle will not burn in zero gravity",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "The flame of the candle will become round",
  "explanation": "Gravity plays a role in flame formation. Modifying the gravity causes different flame types. The common distribution of a flame under normal gravity conditions depends on convection, as soot tends to rise to the top of a general flame, as in a candle in normal gravity conditions, making it yellow. In micro gravity or zero gravity, such as an environment in outer space, convection no longer occurs, and the flame becomes spherical, with a tendency to become more blue and more efficient (although it may go out if not moved steadily, as the CO2 from combustion does not disperse as readily in micro gravity, and tends to smother the flame)."
