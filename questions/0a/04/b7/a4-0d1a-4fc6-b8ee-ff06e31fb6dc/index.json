  "question": "Which of the following countries has passed a law to declare that only Jews have right of self-determination?",
  "option1": "Palestine",
  "option2": "Israel",
  "option3": "Spain",
  "option4": "New Zealand",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Israel",
  "explanation": "Israel has passed a law to declare that only Jews have the right of self-determination in the country. The nation-state law, backed by the right-wing government, was passed by a vote of 62 for and 55 against and two abstentions in the 120-member parliament after months of political argument. The law was enacted just after the 70th anniversary of the birth of the state of Israel. It stipulates that Israel is the historic homeland of the Jewish people and they have an exclusive right to national self-determination in it. The bill also strips Arabic of its designation as an official language alongside Hebrew, downgrading it to a special status that enables its continued use within Israeli institutions.  The members of the Arab minority have criticized the law as racist and verging on apartheid."
