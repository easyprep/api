  "answer": "Changlang",
  "explanation": "The Indian Air Force (IAF) has recently inaugurated resurfaced runway at India’s Easternmost Village-Vijaynagar in Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh. The Vijayanagar Advanced Landing Ground (ALG) is important for ensuring quick mobilization of troops and sending supplies to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China. Here, the runaway is 4,000 feet long and at present is fit only for AN-32 aircraft operations. The IAF had first commenced its operations in Vijaynagar with the Dakota and Otter aircraft in 1962. This was the year when the India-China war took place. The Vijayanagar is not connected by road. It is surrounded by Myanmar on three sides and the fourth side comprises stretches of Namdapha National Park."
