  "question": "How do the Ball-bearings reduce the friction?",
  "option1": "Reducing the area of contact with the use of metallic balls",
  "option2": "Increasing the area of contact with the use of metallic balls",
  "option3": "Applying lubricants to the balls used",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Reducing the area of contact with the use of metallic balls",
  "explanation": "Bearings reduce the friction of certain moving parts by replacing sliding friction with rolling friction. They are used to provide better linear motion or rotation around a fixed axis. Roller bearings are typically cylinders similar to free rollers, while ball bearings are spheres that are held in a track."
