  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "This question is framed upon three concepts of Buddhism called Anicca, Anatta and Dukkha.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Anicca (Sanskrit : Anitya) means inconsistency of impermanence. It refers to the fact that all conditioned things are in constant state of flux. In reality, nothing ever ceases to exist; only the appearance of the thing ceases as it changes from one form into another.</li>\r\n<li>Anatta (Sanskrit: Anatman) is also known as the non-self, denotes that phenomena are not, or are without, a permanent self. It is used to describe any and all composite, phenomenal and temporal things, from macrocosmic to microcosmic. It all is mental and impermanent.</li>\r\n<li>Duhhka is dissatisfaction. Buddhism believes that nothing in the physical world can bring lasting deep satisfaction. Basically, in Buddhism they believed that suffering will always be part of life, and in order to be satisfied and happy we will need much more than just materialistic things.</li>\r\n</ul>"
