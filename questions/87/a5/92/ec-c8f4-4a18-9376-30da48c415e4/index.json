  "question": "In context with the recent observations made by NASA’s Parker space probe about the corona, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The corona is the outermost part of the sun.</li>\n<li>The surface of the sun is hotter than the corona.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nCorona is the outermost part of the sun. It is composed of plasma and is the part that is visible during the total solar eclipse. The parker space probe recently sent back key information about the solar corona and corona holes from which the solar winds emanate and affect the space weather.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe corona of the sun is much hotter than its surface by hundreds of degree Celsius. This is one of the key mysteries surrounding the star system. It is also much less dense than the surface and appears dim compared to the surface."
