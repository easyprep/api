  "question": "Consider the following authorities: <ol> <li>State Public Service Commission</li> <li>Joint State Public Service Commission (JSPSC)</li> <li>Lokpal</li> </ol> Which of the above has/have Constitutional status?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option3": "3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "The institution of&nbsp;Lokpal&nbsp;is a statutory&nbsp;body&nbsp;and not a Constitutional body. It was not given the&nbsp;constitutional&nbsp;status as the&nbsp;Constitutional&nbsp;Amendment Bill, which provided for making the&nbsp;Lokpal a constitutional body, was defeated in the House. JSPSC is a statutory and not constitutional body. It can be created by an act of Parliament on the request of the concerned state legislatures."
