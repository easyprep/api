  "question": "The Sycamore has been in news recently. In this context, consider the following statements about this computer:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Sycamore’s chip uses bits instead of qubits.</li>\n<li>Sycamore was developed by IBM.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nSycamore is a quantum computer. Hence it uses qubits instead of bits. The Sycamore uses a 53 qubit chip. It was used for achieving quantum supremacy in October. Usually, scientists aim at developing a 100 qubit chip for carrying out such experiments.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Sycamore was developed at Google. It performed a complex calculation, which is unsolvable by conventional computers in reasonable time, in 200 seconds. The quantum computer has microscopic circuits of superconducting metal. It makes use of quantum concepts like ‘superposition’ and ‘entanglement’."
