  "question": "Which country has strongly criticized Â China's lending practices under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)?",
  "option1": "Russia",
  "option2": "United States",
  "option3": "France",
  "option4": "England",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "United States",
  "explanation": "Top US diplomat Alice Wells has strongly criticized China\\'s international development projects and lending practices under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). He also questioned the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) on its commercial viability. China does not report on its overall lending despite being the largest lender globally. Hence, neither rating agencies nor the Paris club nor IMF are able to monitor those financial transactions. The lack of transparency was a means to hide risks to countries that borrowed from China to finance the development projects. It leads to a surrender of strategic assets and it diminishes sovereignty. The case of Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka and a runway in the Maldives were among the projects cited as examples of China financing projects of questionable commercial viability."
