  "question": "When two bodies, of different mass, are acted upon by the same force for the same time, then both bodies acquire the:",
  "option1": "Same velocity",
  "option2": "Same momentum",
  "option3": "Same acceleration",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Same momentum",
  "explanation": "Force= Rate of change of momentum<br> (F = dp/dt)<br> p= momentum<br> v=velocity<br> p=mv<br> Mass will remain same for both the bodies, and when Force applied is equal on both the bodies, then there will be different rate of change of velocity (different acceleration) to have same momentum."
