This is the first of its kind and is to be used for treating injured turtles rescued from smugglers and poachers. It will be able to shelter 500 turtles at a time and will be spread over an area of half a hectare.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe Bhagalpur turtle rehabilitation centre is for treating freshwater turtles. The River Ganga flows through this region and features sand banks in middle of the rivers- favourable for turtle breeding. Turtle populations are indicators of a healthy aquatic ecosystem."
