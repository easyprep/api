  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "As soon as the First World War was over, chemical and bacteriological methods of warfare were condemned by public opinion, and their use was prohibited by the 1925 Geneva Protocol. Though, the Geneva Convention of 1925 prohibited the use of chemical and biological agents in international armed conflicts, but it did not talked about the production and stockpiling of the chemical weapons.  But the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons in international armed conflicts. Israel, Egypt, North Korea and South Sudan are four United Nation States which are non signatories to the convention."
