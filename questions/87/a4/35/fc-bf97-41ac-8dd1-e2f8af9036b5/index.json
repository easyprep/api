  "question": "&nbsp; &nbsp;Consider the following statements about the Shola Grassland: <ol> <li>Shola forests are predominantly found in the Eastern Himalayas</li> <li>They have short life and take a short time from germination to reach maturity</li> </ol> &nbsp; &nbsp;Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 Only",
  "explanation": "First statement is incorrect because Shola grassland is found in the Western Ghats. Shola grasslands are confined to the high altitude (&gt;1700 m) in the Western Ghats and interspersed with tropical forests. Shola grasslands are maintained by fire and frost. The species of Nilgiri Tahr is found only in the shola grasslands and nowhere else in the world."
