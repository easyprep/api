  "option4": "Karnataka",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Andhra Pradesh",
  "explanation": "The first-of-its-kind ‘fruit train’ of the country was recently flagged off from Tadipatri Railway Station of Andhra Pradesh. \r\nThe train carried a little less than 1000 metric tonnes of locally grown bananas to the Jawaharlal Nehru Port also called the gateway port in Mumbai. The consignment will be exported to Iran from the port in Mumbai. The entire train sent for export saved huge fuel and time, which would have been otherwise spent for the transportation to the port by road, which is 900 km away. Andhra Pradesh topped the country in fruits production in 2018-19, as per the recent data of Ministry of Agriculture."
