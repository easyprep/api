  "explanation": "The “Inclusive Growth and Development Report” is published by the World Economic Forum. It covers 109 economies, and tries to improve our understanding of how various economies around the world can use diverse spectrum of policies and institutional mechanisms to make economic growth. The Report presents a new global index, the Inclusive Development Index (IDI), providing a richer and more nuanced assessment of countries’ level (and recent performance) of economic development than the conventional one based on GDP per capita alone. It also provides a policy framework showing the many factors that can drive a more inclusive growth process."
