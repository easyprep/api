  "question": "If the diagonals of two squares are in the ratio of 2 : 5, there area will be in the ratio of",
  "option1": "4 : 25",
  "option2": "4 : 5",
  "option3": "4 : 2",
  "option4": "$latex \\sqrt{2} : \\sqrt{5}$",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "4 : 25",
  "explanation": "Let diagonals be 2x and 5x. \r\n$latex \\\\therefore \\\\frac{A1}{A2} = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\times (2x)^{2}}{\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\times (5x)^{2}} = \\\\frac{4}{25}&s=2$\r\n=> 4 : 25\r\nHence option [A] is the right answer."
