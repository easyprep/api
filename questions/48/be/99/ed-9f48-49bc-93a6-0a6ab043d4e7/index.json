  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about the Gravity Model of Migration?<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>According to the gravity model, the migration between two places is inversely proportional to the product of the population of the two centres.</li>\r\n<li>The gravity model implies that the capacity of an area to attract migrants depends upon the size of its population or its economic potential.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "The gravity model has been frequently used for explaining human geographical phenomena in the early years of the twentieth century. <br />According to the gravity model, the migration between two places is directly proportional to the product of the population of the two centres, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two.<br />It implies that the capacity of an area to attract migrants depends upon the size of its population or its economic potential. The distance is considered as a hindrance to the population movement."
