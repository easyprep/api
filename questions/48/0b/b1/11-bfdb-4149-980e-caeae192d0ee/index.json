  "question": "Why Barium in a suitable form is administered to patients before an X-ray examination of the stomach?",
  "option1": "barium allows X-rays to pass through the stomach on account of its transparency to X-rays",
  "option2": "barium compound, like magnesium sulphate helps in cleaning the stomach before X-ray examination",
  "option3": "barium is a good absorber of X-rays and this helps the stomach to appear clearly in contrast with the other regions in the picture",
  "option4": "barium salts are white in colour and this helps the stomach to appear clearly in contrast with other regions in the picture",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "barium is a good absorber of X-rays and this helps the stomach to appear clearly in contrast with the other regions in the picture",
  "explanation": "Barium is given in adequate amount to patients before X-ray examination. The gut (gastrointestinal tract) does not show up very well on ordinary X-ray pictures. However, if you drink a white liquid that contains a chemical called barium sulphate, the outline of the upper parts of the gut (oesophagus, stomach and small intestines) shows up clearly on X-ray pictures. This is because X-rays do not pass through barium."
