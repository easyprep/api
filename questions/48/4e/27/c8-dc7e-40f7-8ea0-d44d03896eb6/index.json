  "option4": "None of them",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of them",
  "explanation": "Offshore drilling to produce hydrocarbons has become popular because Land oil has already been exploited in most places. Offshore oil and gas production is more challenging than land-based installations due to the remote and harsher environment. Much of the innovation in the offshore petroleum sector concerns overcoming these challenges, including the need to provide very large production facilities."
