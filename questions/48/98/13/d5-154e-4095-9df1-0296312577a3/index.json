  "question": "What happens to the time period of a spring pendulum based clock kept on the earth when it is taken to moon?",
  "option1": "Time period reduces to half",
  "option2": "Time period becomes twice",
  "option3": "Time period becomes one-sixth",
  "option4": "No change",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "No change",
  "explanation": "Time of a spring pendulum is independent of acceleration due to gravity. That is why a clock based on spring pendulum will keep proper time every where on a hill or moon or in a satellite and time period of a spring pendulum will not change inside a liquid if damping effects are neglected."
