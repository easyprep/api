  "question": "How many numbers are there which are divisible by neither 5 nor 7, in the set {200, 201, 202, ....., 798, 799, 800}?",
  "option1": 411,
  "option2": 412,
  "option3": 410,
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 411,
  "explanation": "Because total numbers in the given set are : (800 - 200) + 1 = 601. </br>Since we have calculated number of numbers which are divisible by either 5 or 7 or both in just earlier question : (121 + 86) - 17 = 190. </br>So the number of numbers which are divisible by neither 5 nor 7 are : 601 - 190 = 411. Therefore option (a) is correct"
