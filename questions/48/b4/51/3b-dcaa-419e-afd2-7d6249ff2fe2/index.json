  "option1": "Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO)",
  "option2": "ASTROSAT",
  "option3": "Hubble Space Telescope",

  "answer": "Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO)",
  "explanation": "The NASA&rsquo;s X-ray source, Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO), located in a region of the sky known as the Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S), has observed the deepest gamma-ray burst (GRB) event. The two major possibilities to explain the X-ray source invoke gamma-ray burst (GRB) events are- GRBs are jetted explosions triggered either by the collapse of a massive star or by the merger of a neutron star with another neutron star or a black hole."
