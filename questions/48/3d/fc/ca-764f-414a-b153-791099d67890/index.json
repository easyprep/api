  "question": "Despite the fact that Earth is at the closest distance from the Sun in January and farthest in July, why the temperature of earth does not rise in January?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Distance of earth in its orbit from Sun does not affect the seasons</li>\r\n<li>Earth is tilted on its axis which causes rise and fall in seasonal temperatures</li>\r\n<li>At perihelion, southern hemisphere is more hot in comparison to northern hemisphere at Aphelion</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "There are many reasons for it. Blame it on the tilt of the Earthâ€™s axis. Actually, our seasons are determined by the tilt of the Earth and not by how close the Earth is to the Sun. Sunlight raises the temperature of continents more than it does of the oceans."
