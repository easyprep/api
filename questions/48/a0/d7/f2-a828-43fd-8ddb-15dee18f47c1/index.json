  "question": "Consider the following pairs: <ol> <li>Gaia -  is a mission to chart a three-dimensional map of our galaxy Milky Way</li> <li>TRAPPIST-1 -  is a Red Dwarf which is about 40 light years away</li> <li>VAMP -  is an aeroshell-less hypersonic entry vehicle for flight in Venus atmosphere</li> </ol> Which of the above is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "None",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Gaia is an ambitious mission to chart a three-dimensional map of our Galaxy, the Milky Way, in the process revealing the composition, formation and evolution of Galaxy. TRAPPIST-1 is a Red Dwarf which is about 40 light years away. Recently, NASA discovered most Earth-sized planets found in the habitable zone of TRAPPIST-1. The Venus Atmospheric Maneuverable Platform (VAMP) air vehicle (AV) is an aeroshell-less hypersonic entry vehicle that transitions to a semi-buoyant, maneuverable, solar powered air vehicle for flight in Venus' atmosphere."
