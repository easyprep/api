  "answer": "Ministry of Commerce and Industry",
  "explanation": "The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) has been renamed as the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade with a mandate to deal with matters related to start-ups, facilitating ease of doing business among others. The move comes amidst demand by tradersâ€™ body CAIT (Confederation of All India Traders) for forming a separate ministry for internal trade. The newly-named department under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry will look into matters related to promotion of internal trade, including retail trade, welfare of traders and their employees, facilitating ease of doing business and start-ups. Earlier, the matters related to internal trade were under the domain of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs."
