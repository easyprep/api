  "question": "What happens to the velocity of a heavy body when it undergoes an elastic collision in one dimension with a very light body at rest?",
  "option1": "it stops and comes to rest",
  "option2": "it keeps on moving with the same velocity",
  "option3": "it starts moving with half of its initial velocity",
  "option4": "it rebounds with the same velocity",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "it keeps on moving with the same velocity",
  "explanation": "The heavy body keeps on moving with the same velocity when it undergoes an elastic collision in one dimension with a very light body at rest. Note: the body at rest starts moving with double the initial velocity of the heavy body."
