  "answer": "space travel, surgery and magnetic levitation",
  "explanation": "In physics, cryogenics is the study of the production of very low temperature (below –150 °C, – 238 °F or 123 K) and the behavior of materials at those temperatures. Application of cryogenics are in MRI. MRI is a method of imaging objects that uses a strong magnetic field to detect the relaxation of protons that have been perturbed by a radio-frequency pulse. This magnetic field is generated by electromagnets, and high field strengths can be achieved by using superconducting magnets. Traditionally, liquid helium is used to cool the coils because it has a boiling point of around 4 K at ambient pressure.  Cryogenic liquids are also used in the space program. For example, cryogens are used to propel rockets into space. A tank of liquid hydrogen provides the fuel to be burned and a second tank of liquid oxygen is provided for combustion.  Cryogenic processes are also used to supply \\\"banks\\\" storing eye corneas, blood, and sperm for future surgical procedures. In 1961 American surgeon Irving S. Cooper introduced a freezing technique called cryosurgery. Cryosurgery is relatively bloodless because the low temperatures used constrict the blood vessels, stemming the loss of blood."
