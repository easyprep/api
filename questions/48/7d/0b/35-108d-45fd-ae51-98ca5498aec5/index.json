  "answer": "Algeria",
  "explanation": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially recognized Algeria and Argentina as malaria-free countries, after no new cases of the deadly disease have been reported for at least 3 consecutive years. As per WHO, there were now 38 countries and territories that have been declared free of the disease. Algeria, where the malaria parasite was discovered by French physician Dr. Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran in 1880, is only the second country in Africa to reach this milestone. The other is Mauritius, which was recognized as malaria-free in 1973. Argentina is the 2nd country in 45 years to be officially recognized as malaria-free in the WHO Region of the Americas, after Paraguay in June 2018. Malaria is a parasitic disease transmitted through the bite of female Anopheles mosquitoes. The disease is both preventable and treatable."
