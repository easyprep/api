  "question": "Which institute artificial develops leaf creates fuel from sunlight, water.",
  "option1": "CSIR",
  "option2": "ISRO",
  "option3": "IISc",
  "option4": "GSSI",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "CSIR",
  "explanation": "CSIR scientists have developed an artificial leaf that absorbs sunlight to generate hydrogen fuel from water. It is an advance technology that may provide clean energy for powering eco-friendly cars in the future. The ultra-thin wireless device mimics plant leaves to produce energy using water and sunlight. The device consists of semiconductors stacked in a manner to simulate the natural leaf system.",
