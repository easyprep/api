  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Delhi-Bahadurgarh-Rohtak",
  "explanation": "Under the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) project, a total of eight corridors have been planned with three of them namely Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut, Delhi-Alwar and Delhi-Panipat for construction in the first phase. RRTS is a new, dedicated, high speed, high capacity, comfortable commuter service connecting regional nodes in NCR. It is different from conventional Railway and Metro as it will provide reliable, high frequency, point to point regional travel at high speed along a dedicated pathway. It caters to passengers looking to travel relatively longer distance with fewer stops and at higher speed."
