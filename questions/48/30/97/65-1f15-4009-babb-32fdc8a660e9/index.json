  "answer": "Jupiter",
  "explanation": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA's) Juno spacecraft has discovered Earth-sized cyclones at the poles of the Jupiter. It showed the presence of the storm systems that travel deep into the heart of the planet. Measurements of Jupiter's magnetosphere indicate that Jupiter has a stronger magnetic field than expected which is more irregular in shape. The magnetic field on the planet is in the order of 7.766 Gauss which is about 10 times stronger than the strongest magnetic field found on Earth.",
