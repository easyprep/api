It began to lean in 1178 once construction on the second floor had begun. The lean was due to one side sinking into the soft ground.<br />• Angkor Wat was built in the first half of the 12th century. Estimated construction time of the temple is 30 years by King Suryavarman II. It is dedicated to Vishnu. It is replica of Angkor Thom style of art."
