  "option1": "France",
  "option2": "Canada",
  "option3": "Italy",
  "option4": "Ireland",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "France",
  "explanation": "Notre-Dame de Paris, meaning \"Our Lady of Paris\", referred to simply as Notre-Dame, is a medieval Catholic cathedral located in Paris, the capital city of France. The cathedral was consecrated to the Virgin Mary and considered to be one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture. Its pioneering use of the rib vault and flying buttress, its enormous and colourful rose windows, as well as the naturalism and abundance of its sculptural decoration set it apart from the earlier Romanesque style. Major components that make Notre Dame stand out to include its large historic organ and its immense church bells. While undergoing renovation and restoration, the roof of Notre-Dame caught fire on the evening of 15 April 2019. Burning for around 15 hours, the cathedral sustained serious damage, including the destruction of the fl√®che (the timber spirelet over the crossing) and most of the lead-covered wooden roof above the stone vaulted ceiling."
