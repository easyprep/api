  "question": "In which of the following the ecological pyramid of numbers is broad in center?",
  "option1": "Grasslands Ecosystem",
  "option2": "Pond Ecosystem",
  "option3": "Parasitic Food chain",
  "option4": "Forest Ecosystem",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Forest Ecosystem",
  "explanation": "In a forest ecosystem, the base of the Pyramid is formed by the producers like large size trees. The herbivores such as fruit eating birds, deer, elephants etc. make the primary consumers and are less than primary producers. After that, the number goes down at each successive level. Thus, a Pyramid of numbers in a Forest Ecosystem is partially upright or spindle shaped and the numbers is broad in center."
