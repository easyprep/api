The overarching theme at the 58th Venice Biennale 2019 is \\'Our Time for a Future Caring\\', and India has decided to showcase Father of Nation Mahatma Gandhi to ensure a memorable show at the art event. In it, 16 of the 400 Haripura posters will go up on the walls of the India pavilion with the theme ‘Hundred and Fifty years of Mahatma Gandhi’. This will be the second time India will have a pavilion of its own at one of the biggest art events in the world. The India pavilion is curated by the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art (KNMA), and commissioned by the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA). The India Pavilion will revisit through diverse art forms, the indelible memory of Mahatma Gandhi, his philosophical ideas, and the many facets of Gandhi that continue to inspire, provoke and challenge the public, intellectuals and artists alike. In 1938, Mahatma Gandhi commissioned Indian modern artist Nandalal Bose to create paintings portraying different aspects of Indian life to be displayed at the Indian National Congress\\' session in Haripura, Gujarat."
