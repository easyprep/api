  "question": "In light of Punjab’s restricting 9 pesticides for use in Basmati crops, consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>The manufacture, sale, distribution, etc of pesticides in India is regulated by the Pesticide Management act.</li>\n<li>Basmati crops require preventive application of pesticides.</li>\n<li>India has completely banned the use of DDT.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 only",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "2 only",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe manufacture, sale, distribution etc of pesticides in India is under the 1968 Insecticides act. The Pesticide management bill is still a work in progress. All the pesticides in India must be registered with the Central Insecticides Board and Registration committee. After receiving the approval of CIB&amp;RC, the product also needs to be approved by the state government before use in fields.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nBasmati crop is cultivated during the monsoon period when there is low susceptibility to pest attack. The crop duration is July to November. About 6 different diseases may attack the crop. However, pesticide treatment is only required if the attack crosses a threshold level. Punjab’s Basmati growers have been known to use the pesticides preventively and hence the government has restricted these chemicals.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nDDT is an internationally banned organo-chlorine compound used as a pesticide. In India, it continues to be in use despite a partial ban. It persists in nature and is deleterious to environment and biodiversity. India had historically been the largest producer of DDT. It remains in use for countering mosquito infestation. \n&nbsp;"
