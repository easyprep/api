  "answer": "Witness Protection Law in India",
  "explanation": "A witness is a person who possesses with him some secret information to criminal proceedings about which he or she has given or is about to give testimony. In Neelam Katara vs. Union of India case, SC observed that the edifice of administration of justice is based upon witnesses coming forward and deposing without fear or favour, without intimidation or allurements in the court of law. If witnesses are intimidated or allured, the foundation of the administration of justice gets weakened and even obliterated. Similarly, in Himanshu Singh Sabharwal vs State of Madhya Pradesh and Ors 2008 case, the court observed that witnesses are the eyes and ears of the justice system and when a witness is threatened or killed or harassed, it is not only the witness who is threatened but also the fundamental right of a citizen to a free and fair trial is vindicated."
