  "answer": "The brake used in modern elevators",
  "explanation": "In 1853, American inventor Elisha Otis demonstrated a freight elevator equipped with a safety device to prevent falling in case a supporting cable should break. This increased public confidence in such devices. Otis established a company for manufacturing elevators and patented (1861) a steam elevator.\n\nMany people think that he invented the elevator, but the truth is, he invented the elevator brake. He also invented the railway safety brake.",
