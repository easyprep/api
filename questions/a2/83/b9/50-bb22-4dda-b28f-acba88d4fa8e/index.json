  "question": "The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 km an hour. A boat goes 6 km and comes back to the starting point in 2 hours. The speed of the boat in still water is :",
  "option1": "6 km/hr",
  "option2": "6.8 km/hr",
  "option3": "7.5 km/hr",
  "option4": "8 km/hr",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "8 km/hr",
  "explanation": "Let the speed of boat in still water be x km/hr.\r\n$latex \\\\therefore \\\\frac{6}{x+4}+\\\\frac{6}{x-4} = 2&s=1$\r\n$latex => 6\\\\left ( \\\\frac{x-4+x+4}{(x+4)(x-4)} \\\\right ) = 2&s=1$\r\n$latex => 6x = x^{2}-16$\r\n$latex => x^{2}-6x-16 = 0$\r\n$latex => x^{2}-8x+2x-16 = 0$\r\n$latex => x(x-8)+2(x-8) = 0$\r\n$latex => (x+2)(x-8) = 0$\r\n$latex => x = 8km/hr$\r\nHence option [D] is correct answer."
