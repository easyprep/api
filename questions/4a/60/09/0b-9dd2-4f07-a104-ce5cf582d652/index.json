  "explanation": "The United Kingdom, the United States, France and the Soviet Union were the four countries that occupied Germany, upon the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. Allied-occupied Germany was the state of Germany upon the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II when the victorious Allies asserted joint authority and sovereignty over Germany as a whole, defined as all territories of the former German Reich west of the Oderâ€“Neisse line, having declared the destruction of Nazi Germany at the death of Adolf Hitler. The four powers divided \"Germany as a whole\" into four occupation zones for administrative purposes under the United States, United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union, respectively. This division was ratified at the Potsdam Conference (17 July to 2 August 1945). The four zones were as agreed in February 1945 by the United States, United Kingdom and the Soviet Union meeting at the Yalta Conference; setting aside an earlier division into three zones (excluding France) proposed by the London Protocol."
