  "question": "Despite the fact that Mir Kasim was placed as Nawab of Bengal by British, why he fell out with the British and fought them at the Battle of Buxar?<br> 1. He failed to satisfy the constant demand of money from the British<br> 2. He was frustrated of the adverse impact of firman and dastak on local traders<br> 3. He had secretly made a treaty with the Dutch at Chinsurah<br> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "All the statements in this question are correct. It was during Farrukhsiyar reign, in 1717, that the British East India Company purchased duty-free trading rights in all of Bengal for a mere three thousand rupees a year. Mir Kasim opposed that the imperial Dastak was discriminatory. The British could trade without paying taxes but the other local merchants with dastaks were required to pay up to 40% of their revenue as tax. In a reaction, Mir Kasim abolished all taxes on the local traders as well. This upset the British and hostility was renewed and this became a reason of the Battle of Buxar. Third statement is not correct. It was his father in law Mir Jafar who entered into a secret treaty with Dutch."
