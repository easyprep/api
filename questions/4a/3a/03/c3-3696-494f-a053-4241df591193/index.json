  "question": "Which country banned imports of the hormone oxytocin to stop its misuse in the livestock industry?",
  "option1": "United States",
  "option2": "India",
  "option3": "Japan",
  "option4": "France",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "India",
  "explanation": "Indian Government banned imports of the hormone oxytocin to stop its misuse in the livestock industry. Oxytocin is referred to as \"love hormone\". It is released naturally during human bonding activities such as sex, childbirth and breastfeeding. Union Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi has stated that abuse of 'oxytocin' in animals, especially milch animals, causes hormonal imbalances and makes them barren sooner. 'oxytocin' is a prescription-only drug and Indian Government had halted its retail sales in 2014. However, attempt to curb its illegal sales has met with limited success and the volume of imports is unclear. Ban on import of 'oxytocin' has been imposed based on recommendations of a panel of top drug experts. Ban on import of 'oxytocin', for human or animal use has been imposed with immediate effect and Central Board of Excise and Customs has stepped up vigilance against those likely to try and smuggle 'oxytocin' into India.",
