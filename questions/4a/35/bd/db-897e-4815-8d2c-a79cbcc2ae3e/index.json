  "answer": "The problem of Khalsa army",
  "explanation": "The main important cause of the first Anglo Sikh was the outrage of the Khalsa army. After the death of Ranjit Singh, there was no controller of the Khalsa army. They murdered whoever came to intervene in their matter. Rani Jindal and Lal Singh realized only a war against the British can suppress the activity of the Khalsa Army. So they were ordered to cross the river Sutlej and the war started."
