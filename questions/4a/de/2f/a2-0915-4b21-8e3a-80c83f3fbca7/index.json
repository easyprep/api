  "answer": "1 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nBhagidari system was launched in 2003 for the purpose of waste management. It aims to involve people in the administrative process in a partnership model, and connect the administrators to the field. The system involved monthly video conferencing among the stake holders to discuss the various issues and made use of e-governance. However, it is now defunct.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nIt involved RWA, market and industrial associations and also bureaucrats from various departments as Bhagidars/ partners. Though the legitimacy of RWA in a region is disputable, the system brought in criteria for recognising an RWA- proper elections to its various offices, 3 years of account books record, etc. The Bhagidars were also trained for their effective participation in the system.\n<strong>Statement 3</strong> is correct:\nThe system achieved global recognition with UN public service award in 2005. It is the most prestigious award, conferred annually for excellence in public service. The award has separate categories for the different regions to ensure level playing field- Africa, West-Asia, Asia and Pacific, Europe and North America and one for Latin America and the Caribbean."
