  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Algae are primitive eukaryotic organisms that do not have true stems, roots and leaves. They are primary producers in aquatic ecosystems and marine organisms. Most of these are edible and have been consumed in different forms since ancient times. Most edible seaweeds are marine algae as most freshwater algae are toxic. While marine algae are not toxic, some do contain acids that irritate the digestion canal, while some others can have a laxative and electrolyte-balancing effect."
