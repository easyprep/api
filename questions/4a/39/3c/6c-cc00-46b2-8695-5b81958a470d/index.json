  "question": "As per recent survey, which of the following pollutants has been highly responsible for the pollution of groundwater in the Indo-Gangetic Basin?",
  "option1": "Arsenic",
  "option2": "DDT",
  "option3": "Detergents",
  "option4": "Landfills",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Arsenic",
  "explanation": "As per recent study, upto a depth of 200 metres, 60 percent of ground water in the Indo-Gangetic Basin is polluted due to arsenic content and high salinity of water. Other sources of pollution are: naturally occurring iron, sulphides, manganese and radioactive decay of uranium in the bedrock, which creates the radioactive gas radon. Other source of pollution is &ldquo;salt water intrusion&rdquo; where sea water seeps into ground water, especially in coastal areas."
