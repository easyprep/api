It is the largest Commonwealth Games to date. It was also the largest international multi-sport event to be staged in Delhi and India, eclipsing the Asian Games in 1951 and 1982. The opening and closing ceremonies were held at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, the main stadium of the event. The 2010 Commonwealth Games were reportedly the most expensive Commonwealth Games ever. It was also the second most expensive international multi-sport event ever held in Asia, after the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China."
