  "option2": "They are fed in summer by melting snow of Himalayas",

  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "They are fed in summer by melting snow of Himalayas",
  "explanation": "The Himalayan Rivers are perennial rivers because they originate in snow covered Himalayan Mountains. They start from the glaciers that seem to melt all over the year. During summers, the snow melts and the rivers get continuous supply of water. On the contrary, the peninsular rivers depend mostly on rainfall for its supply of water and thus become dry during the summer season."
