  "question": "In context with the recent study highlighting the effect of climate change on butterfly lifecycles, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Butterfly species that reproduce quickly are better adapted to climate change.</li>\n<li>Specialist species are more at risk from climate change than generalist species.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nButterfly species that reproduce quickly are found to be more successful at adapting to climate change according to a study published in the journal Nature Communications. While multi-generational butterflies are found to be flourishing, the single generation species are declining.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nSpecialist butterflies are those that rely on a narrow range of habitat and food for survival. High Brown Fritillary, Silver Studded Blue, etc. are some of the examples. Generalists can adapt to a variety of environments and hence have a better chance of adapting to climate change."
