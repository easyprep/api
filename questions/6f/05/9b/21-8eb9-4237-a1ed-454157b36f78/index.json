  "option2": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe NIIF was created in 2015 as a sovereign wealth fund. Sovereign investment fund is a state-owned investment fund. This aims at providing the long-term funding that infrastructure projects with long gestation periods need. It invests in projects like construction of roads, airports, ports, etc.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nIndian government has a 49% stake in NIIF. Other investors in the fund include Abu Dhabi Investment Authority which was the first international institutional investor in NIIF. Domestic investors include Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, etc. Since the government is a major stakeholder, there are concerns regarding the NIIF funding projects that are only of political importance.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nThere are 3 components of NIIF: Master Fund, Fund of Funds and the Strategic Investment Fund. The Fund of Funds anchors/ invests in other funds. This is to diversify the portfolio at minimum risk. These are usually used to invest in funds with good track-record of management. Affordable housing, green infrastructure, etc. are some focus areas.\n&nbsp;"
