  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct. Second statement is incorrect. The Nilgiri hills got their name from the purplish blue flowers of Neelakurinji. These flowers blossoms only one in twelve years. These are mainly found in India in the shoal grasslands of Western Ghats. Neelakurinji is usually 30 to 60 cm high on the hills. The paliyan tribal people of Nilgiri Hills calculate their ages by the blossoms of Neelakurinji. Neelakurinji blooms once in 12 years, but there are many sub-species whose flowering period range from a year to 16 years. Of the 200 species of Strobilanthes found in Asia, Munnar alone hosts 45 species."
