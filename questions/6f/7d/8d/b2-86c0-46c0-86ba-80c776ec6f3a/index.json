  "question": "Which among the following is / are correct statements comparing the Alternative Current (AC) with Direct Current (DC)? <br> 1. AC is free from voltage fluctuations in comparison to DC<br> 2. AC can be transmitted over long distances with minimum power loss<br> 3. In contrast with AC, DC can not be used for high voltage devices<br> 4. In contrast with AC, DC cannot be run through a transformer<br> 5. In contrast with AC, DC can not be used in metal-plating applications<br> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1, 2, 3 & 4 are correct",
  "option2": "2, 3, 4 & 5 are correct",
  "option3": "2 & 3 are correct",
  "option4": "2, 3 & 4 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2, 3 & 4 are correct",
  "explanation": "Alternating Current is not free from voltage fluctuations. Sometimes stabilizer is used to minimize the effect. AC can be transmitted over long distances with minimum power loss. AC can be transmitted over long distances with minimum power loss as in case of DC several other devices like rectifier is required which increases loss. In contrast with AC, DC can not be used for high voltage devices as AC can be easily stepped up with a transformer. In contrast with AC, DC cannot be run through a transformer as frequency is missing in DC, so transformer will not generate e.m.f. DC can be used in metal-plating applications."
