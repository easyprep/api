  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nSaudi Arabia is the largest importer of arms between 2014 and 2018. India is the second largest importer of arms, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. India’s imports have decreased by 24% between 2009-13 and 2014-18 mainly due to delay in deliveries of arms under the licenced production from foreign suppliers. Pakistan stands 22th in this list\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nIndia has signed Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMA) and Communications, Compatibility, Security Agreement (COMCASA). These two along with BECA – Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geo-spatial Cooperation makes up the three foundation agreements that needs to be signed by a country to have access to the US’ cutting edge encrypted communication and satellite data."
