  "answer": "Greece",
  "explanation": "The Heraion of Samos was a large sanctuary to the goddess Hera, on the island of Samos, Greece, southwest of the ancient city of Samos (modern Pythagoreion), in the low, marshy basin of the Imbrasos river, near where it enters the sea. The late Archaic temple in the sanctuary was the first of the gigantic free-standing Ionic temples, but its predecessors at this site reached back to the Geometric Period of the 8th century BC, or earlier. The site of temple's ruins, with its sole standing column, was designated a joint UNESCO World Heritage Site, along with the nearby Pythagoreion in 1992.",
