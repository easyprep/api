  "answer": "there was no Indian Member in the Commission",
  "explanation": "Government of India Act 1919 had introduced the system of dyarchy to govern the provinces of British India. This act had a provision that a commission would be appointed after 10 years to investigate the progress of the governance scheme and suggest new steps for reform. The Simon Commission was opposed primarily because it did not have any Indian representation in the assemblage. The government of Britain had appointed this commission in 1927. The goal of the Simon Commission was to give an account of how the Indian constitution was working."
