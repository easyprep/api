  "explanation": "On 8 August 2019, Pakistan suspended the Lahore-Attari Samjhauta Express train service following the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu And Kashmir (J&K). Though, Indian Railways has clarified that the train has not been suspended & will run normally. The Samjhauta Express (also called the Friendship Express) consists of 6 sleeper coaches and an AC three-tier coach. The train service was started on 22nd July 1976, under the Shimla Agreement that settled the 1971 war between the two nations. On the Indian side, the train runs from Delhi to Attari and from Lahore to Wagah on the Pakistan side. The word Samjhauta means \\\"agreement\\\" in both Hindi and Urdu."
