  "answer": "Champaran Satyagraha",
  "explanation": "Mahatma Gandhi visited Champaran in Bihar, near the Nepal border, on 10 April 1917 along with Dr Rajendra Prasad, and others. He was invited there by disgruntled tenant farmers of indigo plantations (blue dye) who alleged unfair treatment by their European masters: for many years, they had been forced into planting indigo (for dyes) on a portion of their land and then selling it at below-market prices to the British planters who had leased them the land. Reportedly, a Bihari farmer Rajkumar Shukla approached Gandhi in Lucknow in 1916 with a request to examine their plight, and pursued Gandhi wherever he went till Gandhi agreed to accompany him. WB Heycock, the district magistrate, ordered Gandhi to leave the district. Refusing to comply, Gandhi responded: “I feel it to be my duty to say that I am unable to leave this district, but if it pleases the authorities I shall suffer the penalty of disobedience. I have disregarded the order served upon me in obedience to the higher law of our being, the voice of conscience.” The Raj conceded Gandhi’s right to conduct his inquiry, as a result of which the Champaran Agrarian Act came into force in Bihar on 29 November 1917."
