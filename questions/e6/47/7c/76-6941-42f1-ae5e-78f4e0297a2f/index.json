  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nShaheen is a bilateral aerial exercise between Pakistan and China. This year’s exercise marks the eight edition. The exercise was conducted near the Indian border, at the Chinese city of Holton. The JF-17 fighter jets represented Pakistan while the Chinese participated with J-10 and J-11 fighter jets. The exercise was located close to the border with Ladakh.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nAMAN is a multinational naval exercise conducted by Pakistan. This year, the exercise saw the participation of 46 countries. The participants included international warships and observers. While India was not invited to the exercise, China participated with 3 of its warships.\r\n<strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nIndia does not participate in AMAN multinational naval exercise. Given the strained relation between the two countries, the Indian defense is usually on alert during Pakistan’s military exercises in the Indian Ocean Region and near its border. Some of Pakistan’s military exercises were specially designed to counter India. Eg: Exercise Saffron Bandit."
