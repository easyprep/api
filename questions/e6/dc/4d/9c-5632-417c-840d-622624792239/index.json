He had succeeded Lord Ripon in December 1884 and was known as one of the most successful diplomats of his time. Foundation of Indian National Congress by A O Hume in 1885 and Third Anglo-Burmese War of 1885 are two important events of his period. The Third Anglo-Burmese War resulted in the annexation of upper Burma. As a result, his tenure saw the final extinction of Burma as an independent power."
