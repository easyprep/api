  "option3": "Both 1 and 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct. Redistributive Resource Transfer or RRT is defined as gross devolution of fund from the centre to the state government that is adjusted for the respective state’s share in aggregate GDP. In other words, RRT are intra-country transfers and do not augment overall national disposable income like foreign aid does. RRT, thus, involves the transfers over and above states’ contribution to GDP. In RRT, the donor-recipient relationship is also very different because states benefiting from transfers are part of the national governance structures that determine them. <u>As per the Economic Survey 2016-17, Sikkim has received the highest Redistributive Resource Transfers (RRT)</u>. Redistributive Resource Transfer or RRT to a state (from the Centre) is defined as gross devolution to the state adjusted for the respective state’s share in aggregate Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The top 10 recipients are: Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya, Tripura, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Assam."
