  "question": "Where does the oxidation takes place in a Galvanic cell?",
  "option1": "Anode",
  "option2": "Cathode",
  "option3": "Oxidation does not take place",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Anode",
  "explanation": "In a galvanic cell, the half-cell in which oxidation takes place is called anode and it has a negative potential with respect to the solution. The other half-cell in which reduction takes place is called cathode and it has a positive potential with respect to the solution."
