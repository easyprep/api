  "option1": "Srinagar",
  "option2": "Vadodara",
  "option3": "Bengaluru",
  "option4": "Hyderabad",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Bengaluru",
  "explanation": "The First Indian Mushroom Growers Association (IMGA) was launched recently by Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR) at Bengaluru. Mushroom production is indoor actively using vertical space well suited to small farmers &amp; landless labourers. Mushroom cultivation does not require large tracts of land and can be grown on marginal lands under sheds prepared for its cultivation. Mushroom cultivation thus not only meets the dietary requirements but also adds to the income."
