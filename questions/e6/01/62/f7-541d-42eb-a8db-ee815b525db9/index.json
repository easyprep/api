  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction or Hague Abduction Convention is a multilateral treaty developed by the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH). Recently, the Law Commission endorsed acceding to the Hague convention. But the Women and Child Development Ministry denied ratifying the convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (1980), which states that once India ratifies the multilateral treaty, then the government will have to send back women, who have escaped bad marriages abroad and brought their child along with them to India, back to the country of the father&rsquo;s residence. Once India ratifies the treaty, it will have to automatically recognise foreign judgments regardless of the justness of the decision on custody under law or whether was delivered ex parte. Pakistan ratified the convention on 1 March, 2017."
