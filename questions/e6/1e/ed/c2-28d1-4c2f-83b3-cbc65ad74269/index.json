  "question": "With reference to the death of Café Coffee Day founder and the revelation of the suicide letter, consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>India permits use of dying declaration as evidence in court.</li>\n<li>IPC Section 306 punishes abetment of suicide with prison term.</li>\n<li>Appearance of a person’s name in a suicide note automatically leads to registration of an FIR.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "2 and 3",
  "option2": "3 only",
  "option3": "1 and 2",
  "option4": "1 and 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 2",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nDying declaration, in the form of verbal or written statement is permitted as evidence in Indian courts. The statement is to contain the cause of death or the circumstances leading to the death. Supreme Court allowed such evidence in previous cases like Ulka Ram vs State of Rajasthan. It is based on the principle that “a man will not meet his maker with a lie in his mouth”.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\n“Abetment of Suicide” is covered by section 306 of Indian Penal Code. If proven, it is punishable with a prison term of upto 10 years and may also invite a fine. The suicide note is to specifically mention the abetter for enabling this provision. If, however, the accused was simply found to be doing his/ her duty as per law, the punishment is inapplicable.\n<strong>Statement 3</strong> is incorrect:\nThe appearance of a person’s name in a suicide note does not always lead to an FIR. For filing an FIR, it must be established that the accused was deliberately harassing the suicide victim. Also filing of an FIR is not necessarily followed by legal prosecution. This is especially correct when there is insufficient evidence."
