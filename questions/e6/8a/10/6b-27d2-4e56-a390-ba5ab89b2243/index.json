  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "The Azeri-Chirag-Deepwater Gunashli (ACG) complex in the Caspian Sea produces most of Azerbaijan’s crude oil. It is located at about 100 kilometres east of Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. ONGC Videsh had acquired a 2.7% stake in the field in 2013. The contract of ONGC will be expired in 2024. So, ONGC Videsh Ltd and partners have recently signed an agreement with the Azerbaijan government and State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) for extending a production contract for oil fields in the Caspian Sea till 2049. Vankor is Rosneft’s (and Russia’s) second largest field by production and accounts for approx. 4% of Russian production. State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Oil India Ltd and Bharat Petro Resources Ltd, are negotiating to buy 49 per cent stake in Russia's Vankor cluster oilfields to consolidate their presence in the energy-rich Arctic region. Recently, India and Mozambique agreed to expedite development of the giant Rovuma gas discovery, which is planned to be converted into liquified natural gas (LNG) for exports. ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), holds 16% stake in Mozambique offshore block Rovuma Area."
