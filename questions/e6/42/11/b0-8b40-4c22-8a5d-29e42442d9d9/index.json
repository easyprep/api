  "question": "What are the common applications of the Zeolites, which remain in news frequently?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>as water softeners</li>\r\n<li>In cleaning radioactive wastes</li>\r\n<li>for absorbing sulphur dioxide from waste gases</li>\r\n<li>for catalytic cracking</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nÂ  Select the correct option from codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "2, 3 & 4 Only",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "Zeolites are used as water softeners, to remove calcium ions from water. Clinoptilolite, a natural zeolite is used to clean radioactive wastes from nuclear power plant. Zeolites act as catalyst and are used in catalytic cracking to break down large organic molecules found in petroleum into the smaller molecules that make up gasoline, a process called catalytic cracking."
