  "option1": "Southern Railway",
  "option2": "South Central Railway",
  "option3": "East coast railway",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "East coast railway",
  "explanation": "The East Coast Railway has commissioned the government\\'s first waste-to-energy plant. This is the first of its kind in Indian Railways and only the fourth plant in India. \r\nThe plant will turn e-waste and plastic into light diesel oil in less than 24 hours. A new technology called ‘Polycrack’ which was recently patented is to be used in the waste-to-energy plant. A large pile of non-ferrous scrap generated from the Carriage Repair Workshop could not be efficiently disposed earlier, creating environmental hazards. Now the waste can be converted into hydrocarbon liquid fuels, gas, carbon and water."
