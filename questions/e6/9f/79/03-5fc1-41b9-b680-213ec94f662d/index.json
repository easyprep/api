  "answer": "None of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe ‘Sri Lanka Matha’ is the Sinhala version of the Sri Lankan national anthem. Recently, the Sri Lankan government announced that the anthem is to be sung only in the Sinhala language at the main Independence Day celebration in Colombo on 4<sup>th</sup> of February.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nSri Lanka Thaaye is the Tamil version of the Sri Lankan national anthem.

There are other countries with multilingual national anthems. Eg: South African anthem is sung in 5 different languages.
