  "question": "At which of the following speeds radio waves travel?",
  "option1": "3 x 106 m/sec",
  "option2": "3 x 107 m/sec",
  "option3": "3 x 108 m/sec",
  "option4": "3 x 109 m/sec",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "3 x 108 m/sec",
  "explanation": "Radio waves travel very quickly through space. Radio waves are a kind of electromagnetic radiation, and thus they move at the speed of light. The speed of light is a little less than 300,000 km per second. At that speed, a beam of light could go around the Earth at the equator more than 7 times in a second."
