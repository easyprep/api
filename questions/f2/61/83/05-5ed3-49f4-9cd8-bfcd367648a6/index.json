The book claims that Demonetisation was a terrible idea and the government\\'s own economic surveys have indicated that this move contributed to a slowdown in the economy. According to author, demonetisation was a self-goal by the Modi government. The book attempts to answer the overarching question of whether or not the Modi government transformed India\\'s economy and what the next government\\'s agenda should look like.  The book is also a critical assessment of five years of the brand of economics Modi has championed, often referred to as \\'Modinomics\\'."
