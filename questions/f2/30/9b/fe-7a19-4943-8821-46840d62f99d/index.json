  "question": "In light of SC directive to form special courts in districts with more than 100 pending cases under POCSO act, consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>The POCSO act provides for maximum completion of cases within a period of 1 year.</li>\n<li>The courts are to be set up under state funding.</li>\n<li>Victims cannot be persecuted for perjury under POCSO act.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "3 only",
  "option2": "1 and 3",
  "option3": "1 and 2",
  "option4": "2 only",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nPOCSO act provides for speedy completion of cases- maximum portion of the case is to be wrapped up in a year of filing. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences act, passed in 2012, protects children below the age of 18 years. Section 35 of the act calls for completion of trial by special court within a year. Also, the act calls for statement of the victim to be recorded within 30 days.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe special courts are to be set up under a centrally funded scheme. The implementation part is to be monitored by the NCPCR/ National Commission for Protection of Child Rights. This statutory body was established in 2007. The NCPCR is the monitoring body for the setting up of POCSO special courts. \n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nVictims are not subject to persecution for perjury under POCSO cases due to the provision of the act’s section 22. The section 22 seeks to prevent misuse of the POCSO act using a prison term of 6 months and fines. However, if a child provides false complaint/ statement, no punishment is provided. On the other hand, high incidence of victims turning ‘hostile’ or changing their testimony is one of the reasons for high acquittal rate under POCSO act."
