  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Eswatini",
  "explanation": "Umchwasho is a charity ritual traditionally followed in the Southern African country of Eswatini. According to the Umchwasho ritual, unmarried women are not allowed to have sexual relations and must wear a traditional set of tassels. The tassels are usually made of wool and worn around the neck like a scarf. King Mswati III introduced the ritual from 2001 and 2005 to help stop the spread of HIV and AIDS, which is widespread in the country. But this ban attracted widespread opposition which ultimately leads to the end of the ritual."
