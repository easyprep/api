  "question": "Recently, the opposition parties led by Congress party moved an Impeachment Motion against Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra. In this context, consider the following statements: <ol> <li>The impeachment notice against CJI can be introduced in any of the two Houses of the Parliament</li> <li>As of now, no CJI or judge has been successfully impeached in India</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is correct</u>. The impeachment notice can be introduced either in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. In case of Lok Sabha, the removal motion has to be supported by 100 members whereas, in case of the Rajya Sabha by 50 members. <u>Second statement is correct</u>. Impeachment process has been initiated against many judges so far, but due to the complexity of the process, no judge has been successfully impeached till now. The procedure has been described in Article 124(4) of the Constitution and the Judges (Inquiry) Act 1968. A judge can be removed on account of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. The removal motion has to pass in both houses with a 2/3rd majority of those present and voting. Once the motion is passed by both the Houses, the President then passes an order to remove the Judge or CJI. The impeachment motion against Soumitra Sen, former judge of the Calcutta High Court was successfully passed in Rajya Sabha in 2011, but before the similar proceedings could have taken place in Lok Sabha, Justice Soumitra Sen resigned from office."
