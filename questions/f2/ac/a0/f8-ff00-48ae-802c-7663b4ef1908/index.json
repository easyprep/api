  "question": "On which of the following principles is Hydraulic lift based?",
  "option1": "Pascal law",
  "option2": "Bernoulli's principle",
  "option3": "Stoke's law",
  "option4": "Torricelli's law",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Pascal law",
  "explanation": "Pascal law states that whenever external pressure is applied on any part of a fluid contained in a vessel, it is transmitted undiminished and equally in all directions. This is another form of the Pascal’s law. Devices such as hydraulic lift and hydraulic brakes, are based on the Pascal’s law."
