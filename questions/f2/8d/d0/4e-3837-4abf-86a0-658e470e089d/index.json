  "question": "Consider the following statements about the Poly-Metallic Sulphides (PMS): <ol> <li>PMS Ores are rich in copper, zinc and lead</li> <li>These are mainly found on the ocean seabed</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Recently, the central government has approved a proposal by the Earth Sciences Ministry to sign the agreement with International Seabed Authority (ISA) to mine for so-called polymetallic sulphides over 10,000 sq km around parts of central and southwest Indian ridges in the ocean. <strong>What are Poly-Metallic Sulphides (PMS)?</strong> Polymetallic sulphides (PMS) are precipitates of hot fluids from upwelling hot magma that is deposited over the deep seabed. PMS generally contain iron, copper, zinc, silver, gold and platinum. In recent years, these compounds in the ocean ridges have attracted worldwide attention for their long-term commercial and strategic values. These ores contain important minerals, some of which have been designated as strategic and critical importance."
