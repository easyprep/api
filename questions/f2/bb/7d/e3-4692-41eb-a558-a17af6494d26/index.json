  "answer": "Ecuador",
  "explanation": "The Ambato Earthquake is an earthquake happened in Tungurahua province of Ecuador on 5 August 1949 killing 5050 people It measures 6.4 on the seismic magnitude scales. Earthquakes in Ecuador stem from two major interrelated tectonic areas: the subduction of the Nazca Plate under the South American Plate and the Andean Volcanic Belt. The 1949 Ambato earthquake initially followed an intersection of several northwest-southeast-trending faults in the Inter-Andean Valley which were created by the subduction of the Carnegie Ridge. Strata of rock cracked as the earthquake ruptured the faults, sending out powerful shock waves. Today threats exist throughout the country from both interplate and intraplate seismicity."
