  "question": "The fourth proportional to 0.12, 0.21, 8 is:",
  "option1": 8.9,
  "option2": 14,
  "option3": 17,
  "option4": 56,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 14,
  "explanation": "Let the fourth proportional be x. Then, \r\n$latex \\\\frac{0.12}{0.21} = \\\\frac{8}{x}&s=1$\r\n$latex => x = 8\\\\times \\\\frac{0.21}{0.12}&s=1$\r\n$latex => x = 8\\\\times \\\\frac{21}{12}&s=1$\r\n$latex => x = 14$\r\nHence option [B] is the right answer."
