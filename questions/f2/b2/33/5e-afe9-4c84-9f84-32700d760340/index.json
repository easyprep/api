  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Mekong Delta is formed by the Mekong River flowing into the sea in Vietnam. The delta is located in south- western part of Vietnam and is also known as the ‘Nine Dragon River Delta’. The region has been affected due to the increase in overfishing, sand mining and dam building activities.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:       </strong>\nThe Mekong River flows through several countries before draining into the South China Sea. It originates in the Tibetan Plateau and flows through  China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Over 60 million people are dependent on this river which has been slowing to a mere trickle in some places."
