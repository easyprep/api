  "option2": 48,
  "option3": 112,
  "option4": 80,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 80,
  "explanation": "We know that, First number $latex \\\\times$ Second number = LCM $latex \\\\times$ HCF\r\n$latex =>$Second Number $latex =\\\\frac{16\\\\times 160}{32}=80&s=1$\r\nHence option [D] is the right answer."
