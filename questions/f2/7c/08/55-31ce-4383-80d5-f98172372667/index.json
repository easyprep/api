  "question": "The NGT has directed the centre to develop an action plan for protection of the Great Indian Bustard. In this context, consider the following statements about the bird:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is listed as critically endangered species by IUCN.</li>\n<li>Irrigation contributes to disappearance of the Great Indian Bustards.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Great Indian Bustards are listed as critically endangered species by IUCN. They face threat from habitat loss, poaching, etc. They are some of the tallest birds in their habitat- grasslands. These birds are protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe birds do not inhabit irrigated lands. They are found in dry grasslands and scrub ecosystem. Hence they face threat from large irrigation projects like Rajasthanâ€™s Indira Gandhi canal irrigation project. Previously spread over India and Pakistan, they are now confined to certain states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, etc."
