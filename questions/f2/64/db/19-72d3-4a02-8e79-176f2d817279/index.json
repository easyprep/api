  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because KIRAN is an initiative by Department of Science &amp; Technology (DST) to restructure the <em>women specific programmes</em> under one umbrella. Through this initiative, the DST aims to address various issues related to women scientists like unemployment, break-in career, relocation, etc. Also, it envisages providing opportunities in research, entrepreneurship, science, communication, technology development/ demonstration and self-employment. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u> because there is no such provision. However, with an aim to enhance the quality of life of women in India, KIRAN is also providing budgetary support for creating Women Technology Park (WTP), which would consist of technologies related to aquaculture, livestock management, energy conservation and textile technologies in order to develop and improve their health &amp; nutrition."
