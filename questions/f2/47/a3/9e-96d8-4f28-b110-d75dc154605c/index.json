  "answer": "Spain",
  "explanation": "Honduras declared independent in 1821 from Spain. In March 1524, Gil Gonzalez Davila became the first Spaniard to enter Honduras as a conquistador followed by Hernan Cortes, who had brought forces down from Mexico. Resistance to conquest was led in particular by Lempira. Many regions in the north of Honduras never fell to the Spanish, notably the Miskito Kingdom. After the Spanish conquest, Honduras became part of Spain's vast empire in the New World within the Kingdom of Guatemala. Trujillo and Gracias were the first city-capitals. The Spanish ruled the region for approximately three centuries. Honduras gained independence from Spain in 1821 and was a part of the First Mexican Empire until 1823 when it became part of the United Provinces of Central America.",
