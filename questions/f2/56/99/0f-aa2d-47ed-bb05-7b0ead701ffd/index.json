  "question": "In recent times, the Biotechnology has been widely accepted worldwide for improvement of cultivars with regard to___:<br> 1. Insect pest resistance<br> 2. Tolerance to drought, cold and salinity condition<br> 4. Nutrition enhancement<br> 5. Post harvest quality<br> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "Biotechnology is a tool that has been widely accepted worldwide for improvement of cultivars with regard to <ol> <li>Insect pest resistance</li> <li>Tolerance to drought, cold and salinity condition</li> <li>Nutrition enhancement</li> <li>Post harvest quality</li> <li>Value addition.</li> </ol> Biotechnological applications should be viewed comprehensively. Both r-DNA and non-r-DNA applications such as fermentation, bio-processing, bio-pesticides, bio-fertilizers, tissue-culture, micro-propagation and related technological components which are important for Indian agriculture including animal husbandry and fisheries should be viewed as integral components of the planning and promotion of biotechnological applications in agriculture,&#8221;"
