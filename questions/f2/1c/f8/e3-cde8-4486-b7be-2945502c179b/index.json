  "explanation": "Georgia's intangible cultural heritage is \"Khorumi Dance\". The Khorumi is a war dance that originated in the region of Guria/Adjara, which is located in the southwestern region of Georgia. The dance was originally performed by only a few men. However, over time it has grown in scale. In today's version of the Khorumi, thirty or forty dancers can participate. The dance was inscribed on the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Georgia list in 2013. Although the number of performers changed, the content of the dance is still the same. The dance brings to life the Georgian army of the past centuries."
