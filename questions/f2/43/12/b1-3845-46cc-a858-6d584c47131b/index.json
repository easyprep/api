  "question": "In the wake of the partition of Bengal in 1905, Bengal saw some new movements such as boycott, Swadeshi, National Education etc. Out of them, the &#8220;boycott&#8221; was inspired by most probably which among the following contemporary events?",
  "option1": "Boycott of all foreign goods by Mahatma Gandhi in South Africa",
  "option2": "Boycott of American goods by Chinese",
  "option3": "Boycott of some English Land Agents by the Irish people",
  "option4": "Boycott of Japanese products in China",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Boycott of American goods by Chinese",
  "explanation": "The first option in this question is incorrect, because in Bengal, Gandhi was not known as such in 1905. The last option is ruled out because the boycott of the Japanese products started in 1915 for the first time. The Option C is not correct, because these events were of trivial nature. The Option B is correct. The Boycott of American goods by Chinese has started in 1882 in response to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. This was one important event which got its further developments in 1905-06. But it will not be right to say that only this event inspired the Bengalis. The leaders such as SN Banerjee had also inspired / educated the people about the impact of the political tools."
