  "answer": "62nd",
  "explanation": "India has been ranked at the 62nd place among emerging economies on an Inclusive Development Index (IDI-2018) released by World Economic Forum (WEF). India\\'s position is much below China (26th) and Pakistan (47th). The 2018 index, which measures the progress of 103 economies on three individual pillars - growth and development; inclusion; and inter-generational equity - has been divided into two parts. The first part covers 29 advanced economies and the second 74 emerging economies. Norway remains the world\\'s most inclusive advanced economy, while Lithuania again tops the list of emerging economies. The index takes into account the living standards, environmental sustainability and protection of future generations from further indebtedness."
