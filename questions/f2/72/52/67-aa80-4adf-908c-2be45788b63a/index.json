This style, with some slight modifications, is also practised at high school and middle school levels, and also among younger participants, where it is known as scholastic wrestling. These names help distinguish collegiate wrestling from other styles of wrestling that are practised around the world such as those in the Olympic Games: freestyle wrestling and Greco-Roman wrestling."
