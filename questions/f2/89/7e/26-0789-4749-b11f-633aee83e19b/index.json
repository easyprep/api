  "question": "A certain sum of money yields 1261 Rs. as compound interest for 3 years at 5% per annum. The sum is :",
  "option1": "7500 Rs",
  "option2": "8400 Rs",
  "option3": "8000 Rs",
  "option4": "9000 Rs",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "8000 Rs",
  "explanation": "Let the principal be x Rs. Now, \r\n$latex C.I. = P\\\\left [ \\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{R}{100} \\\\right )^{T} - 1 \\\\right ]&s=1$\r\n$latex => 1261 = x\\\\left [ \\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{5}{100} \\\\right )^{3} - 1 \\\\right ]&s=1$\r\n$latex => 1261 = x\\\\left ( \\\\frac{9261}{8000} - 1 \\\\right )&s=1$\r\n$latex => 1261 = x\\\\left ( \\\\frac{9261-8000}{8000} \\\\right ) = \\\\frac{1261x}{8000}&s=1$\r\n$latex => x = \\\\frac{1261\\\\times 8000}{1261} = 8000 Rs.&s=1$\r\nHence option [C] is correct answer."
