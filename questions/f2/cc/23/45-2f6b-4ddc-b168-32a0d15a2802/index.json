  "question": "Consider the following statements about NavIC.\n<ol>\n<li>It is an Indian version of US’s GPS.</li>\n<li>India is the only country after the US to develop its own positioning system.</li>\n<li>NavIC covers only the terrestrial expanse of the country.</li>\n<li>It is being developed by ISRO</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\n<strong>Select the correct option from the codes given below: </strong>",
  "option1": "1, 3 and 4",
  "option2": "1, and 4",
  "option3": "1, 2 and 4",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, and 4",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nNavIC is Navigation with Indian Constellation. It is an Indian Positioning system that is set to replace the Global positioning System from the US. GPS is being used in many applications in India- ranging from mobiles to taxis. GPS is operated by the US air force.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nApart from US, other countries like Russia and China have their own navigation and positioning system. India is only the latest addition to this list. The countries develop their own technology to become self-reliant especially for defence purposes. Russian GLONASS, Chinese Beidou navigation satellite system/ BDS and EU’s Galileo are some examples.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nNavIC will help in terrestrial, aerial and marine navigation. It has the expanse of the country along with 1500km stretch from the boundaries covered under Primary Service Area. The Extended Service Area will cover an even greater expanse. It will have many functions like vehicle tracking, navigation aid for trekkers, voice aid for drivers, etc.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is correct:\nISRO is planning the implementation. The system is realisable because of a constellation of satellites launched by ISRO in geosynchronous and geostationary orbit. The Indian regional navigation satellite system (IRNSS) was complete in 2017."
