  "answer": "2 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\n    The Indian military has taken several steps towards ‘greening’ its capacities and functioning. The largest polluter tag is held by the US army. Studies say that if the US army were a country, it would be the 47<sup>th</sup> largest emitter of greenhouse gases- a larger emitter than Portugal.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe Green Governance Program involves the Indian army and the ICICI bank. It was launched in 2011 to implement several measures for environmental conservation. Indian Army Environment and Ecology Cell is the nodal body implementing the project. Its projects include rainwater harvesting, de-silting of water bodies, check dam construction, etc.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nKarwar naval base is the largest of its kind in India. It is also the largest naval base east of the Suez canal. It was designed with efficient energy, water and wastewater management capabilities. It is being carried out under Project Seabird."
