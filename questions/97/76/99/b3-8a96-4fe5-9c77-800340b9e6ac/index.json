  "answer": 0.02,
  "explanation": "Principal + interest for 8 years = 2900 Rs…………(I)\r\nPrincipal + interest for 10 years = 3000 Rs……..…(II)\r\nSubtracting equation (I) from (II) \r\nInterest for 2 years = 100 Rs. \r\n∴ Interest for 8 years = 400 Rs. \r\nFrom equation (I), \r\nPrincipal = (2900 - 400) = 2500 Rs. \r\n$latex \\\\therefore Rate = \\\\frac{SI\\\\times 100}{Princ.\\\\times Time}&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{400\\\\times 100}{8\\\\times 2500} = 2\\\\%&s=1$\r\nHence option [A] is correct answer."
