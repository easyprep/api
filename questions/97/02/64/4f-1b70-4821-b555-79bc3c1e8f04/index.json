  "question": "Which country’s survey team recently became the first to reach the peak of Everest this year?",
  "option1": "Nepal",
  "option2": "India",
  "option3": "China",
  "option4": "Thailand",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "China",
  "explanation": "The Survey team of China became the first to climb and reach the peak Mt. Everest this year. This is a part of the project to remeasure the exact height of the Everest.\r\nBoth China and Nepal cancelled the ‘spring’ climbing season on the world’s tallest mountain in order to prevent the expedition teams from getting infected by coronavirus. Hence the Chinese survey team is likely the only team to reach the peak of Everest, this year."
