  "question": "Deltas are common in the East-flowing river of India, whereas they are nearly absent on the West coast because West-flowing rivers</span>",
  "option1": "originate in dry areas",
  "option2": "originate largely in the Western Ghats and have short distance to cover to the sea",
  "option3": "are few",
  "option4": "have lesser water volume and carry less run-off silt",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "have lesser water volume and carry less run-off silt",
  "explanation": "Most of the Western flowing rivers travel a lesser distance than eastern flowing rivers before draining into the sea. On way to Western coast through hard rocks and over a steep gradient rift valley, they couldnâ€™t collect a large amounts of Slit and flow with very high speed compared to East flowing rivers. Eastern rivers flow through broken hills and are widened and flow with lesser velocity before draining into sea. So, they are capable of depositing sediments and silt before draining into the sea and usually form a Delta.</span>"
