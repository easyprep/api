  "question": "Which new initiative has been launched by the Government of India (GoI) to promote use of Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG)?",
  "option1": "CBG-U",
  "option2": "SATAT",
  "option3": "STAAR",
  "option4": "AMOKSH",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "SATAT",
  "explanation": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister, Dharmendra Pradhan has recently launched an innovative initiative called SATAT (Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation)  in New Delhi on 1st October 2018 to promote Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG) as an alternative fuel. In it, Public sector oil marketing companies  - Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum - will seek expression of interest from potential entrepreneurs to set up CBG production plants and make it available in the market for use as auto fuel. The Bio-gas is produced naturally through a process of anaerobic decomposition from waste / bio-mass sources like agriculture residue, cattle dung, sugarcane press mud, municipal solid waste, sewage treatment plant waste, etc. After purification, it is compressed and called CBG, which has pure methane content of over 95%. Compressed Bio-Gas is exactly similar to the commercially available natural gas in its composition and energy potential. Thus, this move will benefit vehicle-users as well as farmers and entrepreneurs."
