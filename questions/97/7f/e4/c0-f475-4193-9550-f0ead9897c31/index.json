  "question": "A hollow sphere of radius R, a hollow cube of side R and a thin circular plate of radius R, made up of the same material, are all heated to 20Â°C above room temperature. When left to cool in the room, which of them will reach the room temperature first?",
  "option1": "Circular plate",
  "option2": "Cube",
  "option3": "Sphere",
  "option4": "All of them will reach the room temperature at the same time",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Sphere",
  "explanation": "The loss of heat is directly proportional to the surface area, hence loss of heat will be earlier in case of sphere because it has the maximum surface area."
