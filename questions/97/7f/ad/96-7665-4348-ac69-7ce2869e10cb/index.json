  "question": "When is the gamma ray emitted?",
  "option1": "When a nucleus in a ground state goes to the excited state",
  "option2": "When a nucleus in an excited state spontaneously decays to its ground state",
  "option3": "When alpha rays and beta rays collide",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "When a nucleus in an excited state spontaneously decays to its ground state",
  "explanation": "When a nucleus in an excited state spontaneously decays to its ground state (or to a lower energy state), a photon is emitted with energy equal to the difference in the two energy levels of the nucleus. This is the so-called gamma decay."
