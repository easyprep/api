  "explanation": "S S C Shenoi, Director of Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) has stated that India will soon have its own automated ocean pollution observation system. This new ocean data acquisition system (called automated moorings), which is expected to be functional in April 2018 will not only help in tracking ocean pollution levels but will also offer insights on how the marine system is changing. Estimated cost for setting up this system is Rs 100 crore. After being fully operational, this system will do away with the present practice of collecting water samples from sea and studying their pollution levels thereafter.",
