  "option2": "Stefan Lofven",
  "option3": "Ulf Kristersson",
  "option4": "Jimmie Ã…kesson",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Stefan Lofven",
  "explanation": "In Sweden, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven has been elected for a second term on 18th January 2019 after an agreement was struck between the Social Democrats, Greens, Liberals, and Centre Party, and after the Left Party agreed to abstain from voting against Lofven. He is expected to formally present his new government and its full programme on 21st January 2019. It will be one of the weakest administrations in Sweden in 70 years, with just 32.7% of voters having cast ballots for the two parties. Sweden\\'s inconclusive legislative elections in September 2018  had not left either main parliamentary bloc with a majority."
