  "answer": "1 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nMeasles is a contagious viral disease. It is however preventable with vaccination. Measles are prevalent in Asian and African regions. In India, 1.3 million are infected and 49,000 die annually- 36% of total measles deaths in the world.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nIndia plans to completely eradicate measles by 2020- in a manner similar to how polio was eradicated. Along with 10 South East Asian countries, India plans to eliminate measles and rubella. The country has already reported a huge drop in the number of measles cases. Mass immunisation drives are the main contributors to curbing of these infections- universal immunisation program with the measles rubella vaccine.\n<strong>Statement 3</strong> is correct:\nMission Indradhanush is a mission of the Indian government to eradicate 8 vaccine preventable diseases, including measles. Other diseases include Diphtheria, Japanese Enchephalitis, etc. In 2017, Intensified Mission Indradhanush was launched. This seeks to achieve full immunisation to at least 90% of the population."
