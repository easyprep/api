  "answer": "CMFRI",
  "explanation": "Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) has developed a multivendor e-commerce website and mobile app named 'marinefishsales' to help fishermen sell their products and marine catch directly to the customers. The website and mobile app were developed under the National Innovations on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) project of CMFRI. This has been done in a move to increase the income of coastal community. CMFRI acts as an administrator for the multi-vendors and consumers interacting through the portal. Fishermen and fish farmers who are willing to sell their products online can form Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and register on the platform.",
