  "question": "With reference to the recent reports of the anomalous surging of the Shispare Glacier, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It is in the Karakoram Range.</li>\r\n<li>It is in China.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe Shispare Glacier is located on the Karakoram mountain range. Unlike many glaciers which are melting in the Hindu Kush- Himalayan region, this glacier has been surging and expanding downslope. This change in the ice- field is expected to affect the rivers sourced by it- like the Indus River.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe Shispare Glacier is in Pakistan. Several villages are located in the downslope region. The glacier has been moving downslope at ten times the normal speed and there has been increasing risk of glacial lake outbursts in the region."
