  "question": "In reference to the recent discussions about ‘corium’, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Corium is a new element in the periodic table.</li>\r\n<li>It is radioactive.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nCorium is a fluid lava like material that is formed at the core of nuclear reactors during cases of meltdown accidents. It is also called Fuel Containing Material (FCM) or Lava like Fuel Containing Material (LFCM). The Chernobyl and Fukushima are two examples of such meltdown accidents.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe corium is radioactive in nature. It can remain so for several decades or centuries. The corium is produced when the core is not properly cooled off. The excess heat causes the melting of the fuel rods inside the reactor."
