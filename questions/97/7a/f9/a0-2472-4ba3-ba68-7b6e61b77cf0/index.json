  "option4": "1, 2, 3 and 4 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2, 3 and 4 are correct",
  "explanation": "Booth capturing originally did not figure under the categories of corrupt practices enumerated under Section 123 of the Act. It was only in 1989 that Parliament included 574 \\\"booth capturing by a candidate or his agent or other person\\\"  as one of the eight categories of corrupt practices. The Explanation to Section 58-A lays down that booth capturing shall have the same meaning as in Section 135-A. Section 135-A which was brought on statute with effect from March 15, 1989 under Amendment Act 1 of 1989, prescribes booth capturing to be an offence and the person committing it shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months and which may be extended to a maximum of two years and fine."
