  "question": "Find the average of first 50 natural numbers?",
  "option1": 25,
  "option2": 26.5,
  "option3": 25.5,
  "option4": 25.7,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 25.5,
  "explanation": "Because we know that the sum of first n natural numbers is (1+2+3+.....+n) $latex = n\\\\frac{\\\\left ( n+1 \\\\right )}{2}&s=1$\r\nso we can say that (1+2+3+â€¦..+50) $latex = 50\\\\frac{\\\\left ( 50+1 \\\\right )}{2} = 50\\\\times \\\\frac{51}{2} = 1275&s=1$\r\nand the average of first 50 natural numbers = $latex \\\\frac{1275}{50} = 25.5&s=1$\r\nOption [c] is the right answer"
