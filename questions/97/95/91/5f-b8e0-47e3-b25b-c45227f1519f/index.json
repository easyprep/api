  "question": "The LCM of two numbers is 864 and their HCF is 144. If one of the number is 288, the other number is :",
  "option1": 144,
  "option2": 432,
  "option3": 1296,
  "option4": 576,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 432,
  "explanation": "Required number = $latex \\\\frac{HCF\\\\times LCM}{First number}&s=1$\r\n$latex =\\\\frac{864\\\\times 144}{288} = 432&s=1$\r\nSo the second number is 432.\r\nHence option [B] is the right answer."
