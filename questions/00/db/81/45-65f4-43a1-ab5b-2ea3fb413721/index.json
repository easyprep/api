  "option3": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Under Article 361 of the Constitution of India, immunity from criminal proceedings is available to the President and the Governor only during the term of his or her office. But even these provisions are subject to interpretation as to what is the scope of the immunity that is available and arguably, this immunity need not be available for acts of corruption, which are not in any way related to the legitimate exercise of constitutional powers by these authorities. The Constitution of India does not provide for any immunity for the Prime Minister, Chief Minister or Ministers."
