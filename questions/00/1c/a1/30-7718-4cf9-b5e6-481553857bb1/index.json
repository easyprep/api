  "question": "The product of two numbers is 2160 and their HCF is 12. Number of such possible pairs is :",
  "option1": 1,
  "option2": 2,
  "option3": 3,
  "option4": 4,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 2,
  "explanation": "HCF = 12\r\nNumbers = 12x and 12y \r\nwhere x and y are prime to each other\r\n$latex \\\\therefore 12x \\\\times 12y = 2160$\r\n$latex => xy = \\\\frac{2160}{12\\\\times 12} = 15&s=1$\r\n$latex \\\\because  15 = 3\\\\times 5,\\\\  1\\\\times 15$\r\nPossible pairs = (36, 60) and (12, 80)\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer."
