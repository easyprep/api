  "option4": "Romania",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Georgia",
  "explanation": "Georgia's traditional intangible folk song heritage is \"Chakrulo\". Chakrulo is a Georgian polyphonic choral folk song. It is a three-part drinking song from the region of Kakheti, dramatising preparations for a battle. It is characterized by two highly ornamented individual vocal parts, against a slow-moving drone chorus. When Georgian vocal polyphony was recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Heritage masterpiece in 2001, Chakrulo was cited as a prime example of this. Chakrulo was one of 29 musical compositions included on the Voyager Golden Records that were sent into space on Voyager 2 on 20 August 1977."
