  "option3": "Concurrent forces",
  "option4": "Unit forces",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Concurrent forces",
  "explanation": "The forces which are acting at a point are called as concurrent forces. Note: When concurrent forces in equilibrium act on a body, the state of the body shall remain unchanged i.e. if the body is at rest, it will continue to be at rest. Similarly, a body will continue to move uniformly along the same straight line, if concurrent forces in equilibrium are applied on the body."
