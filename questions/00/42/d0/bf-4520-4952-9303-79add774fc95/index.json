  "explanation": "Degree Creep refers to the increase in the number of degrees required to land a job over time. Jobs that required candidates to hold a Bachelor’s degree some years ago, for instance, might now require a Master’s degree. <br />Statement 1 is correct – If a Bachelor’s degree holds less value, people will start opting for higher degrees to get more chance of securing a job.<br />Statement 2 is incorrect – Secondary education doesn’t count in the phenomenon of Degree Creep; it is only for graduation and post- graduation.<br />Statement 3 is correct – Degree creep results in a sprouting of Post -graduation colleges especially private ones. This is because private unaided education institutes work on the principle of demand and supply and higher demand of post-graduation institutes results in opening of new ones."
