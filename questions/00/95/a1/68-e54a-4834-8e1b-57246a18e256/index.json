  "question": "A tank can be filled by pipe A and pipe B in 2 hours and in 6 hours respectively. At 10 AM pipe A was opened. If pipe B is opened at 11 AM then at what time the tank will be filled?",
  "option1": "1899-12-30T06:23:50.000Z",
  "option2": "1899-12-29T19:23:50.000Z",
  "option3": "1899-12-30T11:38:50.000Z",
  "option4": "1899-12-30T06:38:50.000Z",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1899-12-30T06:23:50.000Z",
  "explanation": "As per the question, part of the tank filled in 1 hour by pipe A $latex = \\\\frac{1}{2}&s=1$\r\nand by pipe B $latex = \\\\frac{1}{3}&s=1$\r\nthen, part of the tank filled by both pipes in 1 hour $latex = \\\\frac{1}{2}+\\\\frac{1}{6} = \\\\frac{3+1}{6} = \\\\frac{2}{3}&s=1$\r\nSo, Time taken by both pipes to fill $latex \\\\frac{2}{3}&s=1$ part of the tank = 60 minutes\r\n∴ Time taken to fill $latex \\\\frac{1}{2}&s=1$ part $latex = \\\\frac{60\\\\times 3}{2}\\\\times \\\\frac{1}{2} = 45 minutes&s=1$\r\n∴ We can say that tank will be filled at 11:45 AM.\r\nHence option [A] is correct answer."
