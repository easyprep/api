  "question": "Consider the following statements with respect to the Infra-red spectrum: <br> 1. Infra-red waves do not easily get scattered and can pass through fog<br> 2. While Rock salt prism is used in experiments for infra-red spectrum; Quartz prism is used in experiments for ultraviolet radiation<br> Which among the above is / are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Infrared spectroscopy is performed with infrared spectrometer which produces infrared spectrum. The Wavelength of infrared wave is longer than visible light and can pass through dense regions in space with less scattering and absorption. Rock salt prism is used in experiments for infra-red spectrum and Quartz prism is used in experiments for ultraviolet radiation."
