  "question": "In light of Google announcing the achievement of quantum supremacy, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The quantum supremacy was achieved using Summit-3.</li>\n<li>The quantum computer succeeded in checking the validity of output from an algorithm for generating a random number.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe quantum supremacy was achieved using Googleâ€™s quantum computer called Sycamore. Summit-3 is a conventional computer which is the most powerful of its kind. It was developed by IBM. Quantum supremacy means that Google was able to perform a complex calculation which no other conventional computer or supercomputer can perform in a reasonable time frame.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe calculation involved checking whether an output generated by an algorithm was truly random. The algorithm was designed to generate random numbers and checking its correct function requires even a very powerful computer 10,000 years. The Google computer was able to finish this in 3 minutes and 20 seconds."
