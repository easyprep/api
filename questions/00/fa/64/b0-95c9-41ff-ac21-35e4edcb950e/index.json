  "option1": "Goa",
  "option2": "Assam",
  "option3": "Kerala",
  "option4": "Jharkhand",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Goa",
  "explanation": "The 36th edition of National Games of India will be held in Goa from November 4 to 17, 2018. The Games were originally scheduled to be held in November 2016 but the Goa administration requested a postponement at the Indian Olympic Association (IOA)’s annual general meeting based on extraneous factors, mainly the State elections. The delays to the 34th and 35th editions of the Games, which were hosted by Jharkhand and Kerala respectively, affected Goa’s plan to hold the mega-event."
