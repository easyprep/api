  "question": "Which of the following is the largest practical unit of mass?",
  "option1": "Slug",
  "option2": "a.m.u",
  "option3": "Hyperkg",
  "option4": "C.S.L",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "C.S.L",
  "explanation": "The largest practical unit of mass is called as Chandra Shekhar Limit (C.S.L) which is equivalent to 1.4 times the mass of Sun. Chandrasekhar limit is the maximum mass theoretically possible for a stable white dwarf star. This limiting value was named after Indian-born astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, who formulated it in 1930. Using Albert Einsteinâ€™s special theory of relativity and the principles of quantum physics, Chandrasekhar showed that it is impossible for a white dwarf star, which is supported solely by a degenerate gas of electrons, to be stable if its mass is greater than 1.44 times the mass of the Sun."
