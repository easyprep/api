  "option1": "Armenia",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Georgia",
  "explanation": "Georgia houses \"Devdaraki Glacier\". Devdaraki is a valley glacier located on the northeastern slope of Mt. Kazbek. The tongue of the Devdaraki Glacier descends to 2,300 metres above sea level. Devdaraki is known for its intense surging properties that have caused significant destruction in the past (particularly from the late 18th to the late 19th centuries). The glacier surges have led to catastrophic mudflows in the Dariali Gorge which have, on several occasions damaged the Georgian Military Highway. The Devdaraki Glacier is the source of the River Kabakhi (left tributary of the Terek River)."
