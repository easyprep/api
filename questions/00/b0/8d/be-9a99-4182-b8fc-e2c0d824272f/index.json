  "question": "Consider the following statements about the proposed Micro-irrigation fund, in Union Budget-2017: <ol><li>The Fund is proposed with an initial corpus of Rs 5,000 crore</li><li>The Fund would be managed by NABARD</li></ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Both are correct statements. Successive governments in the country have failed to increase the areas under irrigation, which still stands at about 40% of the total cropped area of the country. Under such circumstances, micro irrigation can play crucial role as drought mitigation tools. So, the government in the Union budget 2017 has proposed to create a micro-irrigation fund of Rs 5000 crore to be managed by NABARD."
