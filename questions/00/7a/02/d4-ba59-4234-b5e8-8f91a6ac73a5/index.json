  "option3": "Single Stranded RNA into double stranded RNA",
  "option4": "Double Stranded DNA into single stranded RNA",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Single stranded RNA into double stranded DNA",
  "explanation": "Reverse transcriptase helps in Single Stranded RNA into double stranded RNA transcriptions. Reverse transcriptase (RT), also known as RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. It is used to generate complementary DNA (cDNA) from an RNA template."
