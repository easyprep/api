  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Akbar",
  "explanation": "In 1579, Mahzar Nama was declared by which the emperor declared that if there were conflictions in the views of the debaters, he was entitled to choose any of the interpretations.\r\nWith the Mahzar Nama, Akbar pounced upon the dominance of the intolerant orthodox and allowed free development of a genuine religious spirit. Mahzar Nama was actually an idea of the father of Abul Fazal and Faizi , set that the authority of the King was higher than that of a Mujtahid (doctor of the faith) and if there is a variance, the emperor’s decision should be binding on the Muslims of India. With this edict, Akbar’s judgment was set above every legal and religious authority, so it was the promulgation of the doctrine of Imperial infallibility."
