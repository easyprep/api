  "question": "With respect to the biomes, consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Taiga Biome is absent in southern hemisphere</li>\r\n<li>Maximum part of worldâ€™s geographical area comes under Savannah</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above is / are correct observations?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "The first statement is correct that there is no Taiga biome in southern hemisphere. This is because immediately after the Antarctic circle, there is not much land, and whatever land is there, that is too close to the Oceans. Moreover, the proximity to Oceans keeps them hotter than what they would have been if there was more land. Second statement is incorrect. Roughly Taiga covers 11 % of the world area; temperate biomes cover 9 % of the area; Savannah cover 11 % of the world geographical areas, desert (cold as well as warm) cover 25% and finally Tropical biomes cover 20% of the world geographical area."
