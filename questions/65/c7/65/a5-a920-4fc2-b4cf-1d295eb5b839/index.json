  "question": "Which of these parts of the ear responds to sound waves like a microphoneâ€™s diaphragm?",
  "option1": "eardrum",
  "option2": "lobe",
  "option3": "fluid in the inner ear",
  "option4": "pinna",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "eardrum",
  "explanation": "When a compression of the medium reaches the eardrum the pressure on the outside of the membrane increases and forces the eardrum inward. Similarly, the eardrum moves outward when a rarefaction reaches it. In this way the eardrum vibrates."
