  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "Neap Tides: The sun and the moon become at a right angle to each other with respect to the earth. Thus, the gravitational forces of the sun and the moon tend to counteract one another. The tides during this period will be lower than the normal which are called as the neap tides. They also occur twice in a month- during the first quarter moon and the last quarter moon."
