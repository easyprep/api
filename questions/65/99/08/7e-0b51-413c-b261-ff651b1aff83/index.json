  "question": "Consider the following statements: <ol> <li>The salinity of ocean water increases with increasing depth at higher latitudes</li> <li>The areas of highest salinity are found near equator</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct. Second statement is incorrect because the areas of highest salinity are found near the tropics, from where the salinity decreases towards the equator due to heavy rainfall near equator. Difference in the density of water plays an important role in movement of ocean currents."
