  "question": "King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who is in news recently, is from which country?",
  "option1": "Thailand",
  "option2": "Japan",
  "option3": "Vietnam",
  "option4": "Indonesia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Thailand",
  "explanation": "King Maha Vajiralongkorn has been crowned as the Rama X of Thailand in a dazzling show of pageantry on behalf of the Thai people. This marked the first ascension of a new monarch in seven decades. The key rituals of the elaborate 3-day coronation ceremony began at the Grand Palace in Bangkok on May 4, 2019. King Vajiralongkorn is the 10th monarch of the Chakri dynasty, which has reigned since 1782. The last coronation was held in 1950 for the king\\'s father Bhumibol Adulyadej. Thailand has been run by an arch-royalist junta since 2014. The monarchy takes primacy in the country but it is buttressed by the army. Thailand has a constitutional monarchy since 1932, but the royal family is highly revered by Thais and wields considerable power. Thailand also has strict laws, called lese majeste, which ban criticism of the monarchy. The laws have shielded the royal family from public view and scrutiny."
