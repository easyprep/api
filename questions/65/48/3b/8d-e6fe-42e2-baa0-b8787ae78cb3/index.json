  "option1": "Switzerland",
  "option2": "Norway",
  "option3": "Denmark",
  "option4": "Britain",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Norway",
  "explanation": "Norway has become the first country in the world to shut down national broadcasts of its Frequency Modulation (FM) network by completing its transition to digital radio. The transition, which began on January 2017, allows for better sound quality and more channels and functions at an eighth of the cost of FM radio. The digital switchover means that only the countryâ€™s local radio stations continue to use FM frequencies. Other countries, including Switzerland, Britain and Denmark, are due to follow suit in the coming years."
