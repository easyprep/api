  "question": "The Science of using mechanical devices with human muscle skeleton and nervous systems to assist or enhance motor control lost by trauma, disease or defect is called:",
  "option1": "Gerontechnology",
  "option2": "Biomechatronics",
  "option3": "Orthotics",
  "option4": "Bionics",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Biomechatronics",
  "explanation": "Biomechatronics is an applied interdisciplinary science that aims to integrate mechanical elements, electronics and parts of biological organisms. Biomechatronics includes the aspects of biology, mechanics, and electronics. It also encompasses the fields of robotics and neuroscience. The goal of this science is to make devices that interact with human muscle, skeleton, and nervous systems. The end result is that the devices will help with human motor control that was lost or impaired by trauma, disease or birth defects."
