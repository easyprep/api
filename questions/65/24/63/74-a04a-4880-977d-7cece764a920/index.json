  "question": "With reference to the recent measures by the government to enhance the exports, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Nirvik scheme provides coverage only for pre-shipment credit.</li>\n<li>In case of loss, the bank will receive 90% refund from the government.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Nirvik scheme is for promotion of exports. The scheme covers both pre-shipment and post-shipment credits. The scheme is intended to enhance loan availability and reduce premium incidence for MSMEs. It will keep the interest rates below 4% and 8% respectively for foreign and rupee export credit interest.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe scheme will refund 90% of both principal and interest to the banks in case of losses. The exportersâ€™ creditor bank will receive up to 50% refund within 30 days of complaint. It seeks to simplify the claim settlement process."
