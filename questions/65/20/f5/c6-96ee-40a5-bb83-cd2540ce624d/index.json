  "explanation": "Sir Syed Ahmad Khan was anxious to put Muslims back into favor with the British, but the things were of later period than 1888. At that time, Sir Syed Ahmad Khan made it his special endeavor to persuade his co-religionists to keep aloof from the Congress, which was showing growing signs of opposition towards British policy and administration. In 1888 Sir Syed Ahmad established the United Patriotic Association, which included Muslims as well as Hindu members, all of whom were opposed to the Congress. In 1893 he formed the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental Defence Association of Upper India, confining its membership to Muslims and Englishmen."
