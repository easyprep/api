  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is correct</u>. The Fund is maintained by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). <u>Second statement is incorrect</u> because the RIDF does not provide loan to farmers but to State Governments and State-owned corporations to enable them to complete ongoing rural infrastructure projects. The activities that are financed under RIDF are minor irrigation projects/micro irrigation, watershed development, drainage, forest development, market yard, rural haats and other marketing infrastructure, cold storage, seed/agriculture/ horticulture farms, plantation and horticulture, grading and certifying mechanisms such as testing and certifying laboratories, etc."
