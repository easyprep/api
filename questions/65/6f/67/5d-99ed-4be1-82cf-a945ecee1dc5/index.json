  "question": "With reference to the recent studies by NASA about Venus, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The Venusian atmosphere is mostly composed of carbon dioxide.</li>\n<li>The recent study say that the current Venusian environment is because of ‘global resurfacing event’.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nVenus is referred to as Earth’s ‘twin planet’. The atmosphere in Venus is mostly composed of carbon dioxide and shows greenhouse effect. Because of his, the planet has an average temperature of 462 degree Celsius. The recent studies show that the Venusian atmosphere may have had more favourable temperatures in the past.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe studies say that a ‘global resurfacing event’ occurred about 700 million years ago. A resurfacing event is one characterised by intense volcanic activity throughout the planet. In such an event, the lava covers almost the entire surface of the planet.\n&nbsp;"
