  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "<strong>If it is an ordinary Bill<br /></strong> In case of an ordinary bill or a bill got introduced by a private member and passed by both houses, the president can just withhold assent. It is similar to the Pocket Veto in US. <br /><strong>If it is a constitution amendment Bill<br /></strong>The President has no veto power in respect of a constitutional amendment bill. The 24th Constitutional amendment Act of 1971 made it obligatory for the President to give his assent to a constitutional amendment bill. <br /><strong>If it a money bill<br /></strong>The President may either give or withhold his assent to a Money Bill. Under the Constitution, a Money Bill cannot be returned to the House by the President for reconsideration."
