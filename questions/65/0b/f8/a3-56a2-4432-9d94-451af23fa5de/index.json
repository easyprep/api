  "answer": "Making Digital Marketplaces Fairer",
  "explanation": "The World Consumer Rights Day (WCRD) is observed every year on March 15 to promote basic rights of all consumers, demanding that those rights are respected and protected. It also gives people a chance to protest against the market abuses and social injustices. On this day in 1962, President John F Kennedy formally addressed the issue of consumer rights in US Congress. He was the first world leader to do so, and the consumer movement now marks that date every year as a means of raising global awareness about consumer rights. The first World Consumer Rights Day was observed in 1983 and has since become an important occasion for mobilizing citizen action. The 2018 theme is 'Making Digital Marketplaces Fairer'. In India, besides the World Consumer Rights Day, we observe the National Consumer Day on 24th of December every year.",
