  "question": "Which of the following was not a feature of Dikie Bird plan of Mountbatten?",
  "option1": "Partition of India",
  "option2": "Princely States were given the right to join either or remain independent",
  "option3": "No central authority",
  "option4": "Re-election in some parts of territory",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "No central authority",
  "explanation": "The outline of the plan was to transfer power to the provinces or groups of provinces for an interim period, who would then decide whether to join India or Pakistan or remain independent. Some kind of central authority would be formed to deal with overall defence. Members of the Legislative Assemblies of Bengal and Punjab would decide whether or not to partition their respective provinces. The plan also envisaged holding re-election in NWFP. Nehru opined the plan would adversely affect Central Authority, provoke civil conflict and unrest, and would give a fillip to the Balkanization of India."
