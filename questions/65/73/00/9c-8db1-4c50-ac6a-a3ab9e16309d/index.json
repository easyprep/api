Mughal theory of Kingship in fact kept changing from time to time. While it was theory of autocracy under Babur; it was an idea of divine inspiration under Humayun, concept of divine origin under Akbar; imposition of Hindu conviction of divine monarchy under Shah Jahan and restoration of Islamic thought under Aurangzeb. The last was to a great extent responsible for fall of Mughals.</li>\r\n<li>There was no rule of succession.</li>\r\n<li>Moral fall of the rich and aristocrats</li>\r\n<li>Rulers and their successors were illiterate; they could not sustain the forces of history.</li>\r\n<li>Long warfare with the Southern states; wrongful southern policy of Mughals.</li>\r\n<li>Rise of the Marathas in Deccan.</li>\r\n<li>Issues with Mansabdari System; Jagirdari crisis. Corruption.</li>\r\n<li>Rise of Sayyid Brothers; attack of Nadir Shah</li>\r\n<li>Huge size of Mughal empire; not manageable by traditional means.</li>\r\n<li>Inadequate transport and communication, neglect of Naval power.</li>\r\n<li>Arrival and conquest by British.</li>\r\n</ol>"
