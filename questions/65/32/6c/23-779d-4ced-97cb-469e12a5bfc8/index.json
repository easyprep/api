In his milestone match of the King\\'s Cup football tournament in Buriram, Thailand, he scored the lone goal for his side in the 31st minute from a spot kick for his 69th goal. However, his effort did not make any difference as India ranked 101, lost 1-3 to higher ranked Curacao.

They scored three goals in the space of 18 minutes through Roly Bonevacia, Elson Hooi and Leandro Bacuna."
