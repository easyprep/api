  "question": "Which state doubles the electric fare in the urban areas recently?",
  "option1": "Jharkhand",
  "option2": "Andhra Pradesh",
  "option3": "Karnataka",
  "option4": "Tamil Nadu",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Jharkhand",
  "explanation": "The month of May in Jharkhand will see high bill electricity bills because the rates of electricity units have been doubled. The State Electricity Regulatory Commission approved it on Friday about this hike in electricity tariff. Domestic urban consumers currently pay 2.90 per unit for up to 200 units. According to the new rate, now the domestic consumers will have to pay Rs 5.50 per unit. At present, the domestic rural consumers will have to pay Rs. 4.40 to 4.75 per unit instead of 1.25 per unit. This time only electricity categories are fixed in five categories that include domestic, irrigation, business, industrial and institutional. Commission Chairman Arvind Prasad and Member (Technology) RN Singh, declaring new rates, claimed that there is a provision of subsidy that will provide relief. For this, the government has made a provision of Rs 2000 crores. The commission is not clear about the system of complaint related to the provisions of the subsidy, including the modalities. It is surprising that the cost of electricity in the domestic category will be almost equal to the electricity used in the industries.",
