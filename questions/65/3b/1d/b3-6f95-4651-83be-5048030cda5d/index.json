  "question": "Which among the following can be used as organic and bio fertilizers?<br> 1. Rhizobium<br> 2. Azotobacter<br> 3. Mycorrhiza<br> Select the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "1 & 2",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "There are five biofertilizers viz. Rhizobium, Azotobacter, Azospirillum, Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria and mycorrhiza , which have been incorporated in India&#8217;s Fertilizer Control Order (FCO), 1985. Rhizobium, Azotobacter, Azospirillum and blue green algae(BGA) have been traditionally used as Biofertilizers. Rhizobiuminoculant is used for leguminous crops such as pulses. Azotobacter can be used with crops like wheat, maize, mustard, cotton, potato and other vegetable crops. Blue green algae such as Nostoc, Anabaena, Tolypothrix and Aulosira fix atmospheric nitrogen and are used as inoculants for paddy crop. Phosphate solubilizing bacteria like Pantoea agglomerans strain P5, and Pseudomonas putida strain P13 are able to make the phosphate usable by solubilize it from inorganic sources."
