  "question": "What is the general Q-value for alpha-decay?",
  "option1": "greater than 0",
  "option2": "less than 0",
  "option3": "equal to 0",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "greater than 0",
  "explanation": "Q-value is the net kinetic energy gained in the process or, if the initial nucleus X is at rest, the kinetic energy of the products. Clearly, Q> 0 for exothermic processes such as Î±-decay."
