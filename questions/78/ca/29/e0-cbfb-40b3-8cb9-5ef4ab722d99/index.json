  "question": "With reference to the <em>Ferrodraco lentoni </em>or Iron Dragon remains that was discovered, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The remains were found in Australia.</li>\n<li>The Iron Dragon was a flightless reptile.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Iron Dragon is an ancient reptile that was discovered in Australia. Its bones were preserved with iron rich fluids that had permeated after the animal died. Hence the name choice. It represents the most complete set of pterosaur bones found in Australia.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Iron Dragons were flying reptiles that lived some 96 million years ago. They have a wingspan of 30 feet and their bones are hollow and light to aid flight. But this makes the bones delicate and often don’t survive the ages. Hence it is rare to find such well-preserved specimen of the reptile."
