  "question": "The LCM and HCF of two numbers are 44 and 264 respectively. If the first number is divided by 2, the quotient is 44. Then the other number is :",
  "option1": 132,
  "option2": 147,
  "option3": 264,
  "option4": 528,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 132,
  "explanation": "First Number = 2 $latex \\\\times$  44 = 88 \r\nâˆ´ First Number $latex \\\\times$ Second Number = HCF $latex \\\\times$ LCM\r\n=> 88 $latex \\\\times$ Second Number = 44 $latex \\\\times$ 264\r\n$latex => Second\\\\ Number = \\\\frac{44 \\\\times 264}{88} = 132&s=1$\r\nHence option [A] is correct answer"
