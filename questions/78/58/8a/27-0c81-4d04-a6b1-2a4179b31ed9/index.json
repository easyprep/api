  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of the above",
  "explanation": "A Money Bill can be introduced in Lok Sabha only. If any question arises whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not, the decision of Speaker thereon is final. The Speaker is under no obligation to consult any one in coming to a decision or in giving his certificate that a Bill is a Money Bill. The certificate of the Speaker to the effect that a Bill is a Money Bill, is to be endorsed and signed by him when it is transmitted to Rajya Sabha and also when it is presented to the President for his assent. The Speakerâ€™s certificate on a Money Bill once given is final and cannot be challenged. A Money Bill cannot be referred to a Joint Committee of the Houses."
