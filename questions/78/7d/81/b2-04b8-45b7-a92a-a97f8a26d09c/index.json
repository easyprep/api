  "question": "The term “Catalonia crisis” that was frequently making news is associated with which of the following countries?",
  "option1": "Australia",
  "option2": "Chile",
  "option3": "Spain",
  "option4": "South Africa",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Spain",
  "explanation": "Catalonia's separatist government has declared independence from Spain - but at the same time the national government in Madrid imposed direct rule on the region. Catalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest and most productive regions. The region enjoyed broad autonomy once but that was suppressed under decades of Gen Francisco Franco's dictatorship from 1939-75. When Franco died, Catalan nationalism was revived and eventually the north-eastern region was granted autonomy again, under the 1978 constitution. Recently, on 27 October 2017, after years of mutual hostility, independence supporters have proclaimed Catalonia a republic in response of which Spain has responded by imposing direct rule on the autonomous region."
