The first such law introduced is known as the Warsaw convention (1929). In 1999 the Montreal Convention, titled the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air amended the Warsaw convention. The convention attempts to re-establish uniformity and predictability of rules relating to the international carriage of passengers, baggage and cargo."
