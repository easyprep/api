  "question": "As per a recent research, protein-bases devices have been designed to detect which disease?",
  "option1": "Covid-19",
  "option2": "Tuberculosis",
  "option3": "Pneumonia",
  "option4": "Polio",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Covid-19",
  "explanation": "According to a recent research published in the journal Nature, Scientists have developed a new protein-based biosensor to detect the novel coronavirus.<br />These devices recognise the unique molecules on the surface of the virus and bind to them. Subsequently, they emit light through a biochemical reaction. This technique does not rely on genetic amplification as used in the RT-PCR method and saves time.",
