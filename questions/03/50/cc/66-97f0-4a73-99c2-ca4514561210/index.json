  "question": "When does a saturated hydrocarbon gives a sooty flame on burning?",
  "option1": "When the supply of oxygen is limited",
  "option2": "When the supply of oxygen is full",
  "option3": "A saturated hydrocarbon never gives a sooty flame on burning",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "When the supply of oxygen is limited",
