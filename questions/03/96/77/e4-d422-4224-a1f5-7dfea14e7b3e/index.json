  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Deep and narrow valleys are found in Himalayas not in peninsular plateau. The Peninsular plateau is a tableland composed of the old crystalline, igneous and metamorphic rocks. It was formed due to the breaking and drifting of the Gondwana land and thus, making it a part of the oldest landmass. The plateau has broad and shallow valleys and rounded hills. The hills are rounded because of millions of years of erosion."
