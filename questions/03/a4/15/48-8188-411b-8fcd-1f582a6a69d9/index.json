  "question": "With respect to the recent demands for declaration of Marathi as a classical language, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>A language in which there is discontinuity between the ancient and modern forms cannot be declared a classical language.</li>\r\n<li>Hindi is one of the classical languages.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nDiscontinuity between the ancient and modern forms of a language does not disqualify it from being declared a classical language. The language needs to have high antiquity (1,500 to 2,000 years), original literary traditions, etc. as some of its criteria.\r\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nHindi is not one of the classical languages. There are 6 recognised classical languages in India. They are Tamil, Odia, Malayalam, Telugu, Sanskrit and Kannada. Tamil was the first to be declared as a classical language. The latest addition was Odia, in 2014."
