  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The Constitution does not make any special / specific reference to the Freedom of Press. The protagonists of the “free Press” called it a serious lapse of the Drafting committee. However, the freedom of expression includes freedom of press. Dr. Ambedkar in this context had said on speaking behalf of the Drafting Committee that the press had no special rights which are not to be given to an individual or a citizen. Dr. Ambedkar further said that the “editors or managers of press are all citizens of the country and when they chose to write in newspapers they are merely expressing their right of expression."
