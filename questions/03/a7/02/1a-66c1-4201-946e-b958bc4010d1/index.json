The Bill sets up a Central Consumer Protection Authority to promote, protect and enforce consumer rights as a class. The Bill sets up the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions as quasi-judicial bodies to adjudicate disputes. The Bill empowers the central government to appoint members to these Commissions. The Bill does not specify that the Commissions will comprise a judicial member."
