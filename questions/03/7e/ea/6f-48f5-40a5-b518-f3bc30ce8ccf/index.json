  "option1": "Oman",
  "option2": "Saudi Arabia",
  "option3": "Iran",
  "option4": "Kuwait",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Saudi Arabia",
  "explanation": "Saudi Arabia has abolished flogging, which means beating with whips, as a punishment, as per the order of the Supreme Court. Hereafter, the judges will pronounce fines, jail sentences or community services as punishments.\r\nSeveral Human rights activists have been condemning the Court-ordered floggings in Saudi Arabia, which sometimes extend to hundreds of lashes. Recently, a blogger named Raif Badawi was sentenced to 7 years in prison and 600 lashes and then resentenced to 10 years and 1,000 lashes. He later won the European Parliament's Sakharov human rights prize."
