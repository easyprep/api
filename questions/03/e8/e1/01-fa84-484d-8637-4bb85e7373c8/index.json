  "question": "The income limit defining 'creamy layer' for OBC reservation has been raised to",
  "option1": "5 lakh per annum",
  "option2": "8 lakh per annum",
  "option3": "9 lakh per annum",
  "option4": "6 lakh per annum",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "8 lakh per annum",
  "explanation": "The income limit defining 'creamy layer' for OBC reservation has been raised by Rs 2 lakh per annum even as the Union cabinet approved setting up of a panel for sub-categorization within the other backward classes for even distribution of reservation benefits. The ministry of social justice and empowerment had proposed that OBC families which earn more than Rs 8 lakh per year should be classified as 'creamy layer' -- the ceiling which bars members of the other backward classes from availing reservations in employment.",
