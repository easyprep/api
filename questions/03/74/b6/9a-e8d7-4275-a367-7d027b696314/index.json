  "question": "In light of Maldivian leader seeking asylum in India, consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>Internally displaced people can claim refugee status.</li>\n<li>India has a designated law for handling refugees.</li>\n<li>During the 1959 wave of Tibetan migration to India, the government allowed their employment in government services if they possessed a Registration Certificate/ RC.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 and 2",
  "option2": "None of the above",
  "option3": "3 only",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nInternally displaced people are those who had to flee their original area of residence due to various reasons but they do not face danger in other parts of their country. In such cases, they are not recognised as refugees. This is because, the IDPs are considered to be protected by their own government. However, ‘rule on non-refoulement’ prevents the host country from forcing the repatriation of asylum seekers.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nIndia does not have a designated law governing its refugee policy. In 2015, a private member bill (Asylum bill) was sought to be introduced. But the legislation has not made any headway. Currently, the Indian refugee policy is dictated by laws like The Passport Act, 1967, The Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939, The Foreigners Act, 1946, Passport (Entry of India) Act, 1920 etc.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nIndia is one of the biggest host of refugees in Asia. Its saw a large wave of Tibetan asylum seekers in India in 1959. Dalai Lama was given asylum during this time. The Tibetans were given RC which allowed them to enjoy many rights except the right to vote and to be employed as government servants. RC is prerequisite for IC/ identity certificate that is needed for international travel."
