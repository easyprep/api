  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "The first statement is incorrect because it is the Finance Commission Act of 1951, which states the terms of qualification, appointment and disqualification, the term, eligibility and powers of the Finance Commission. Second statement is correct. The recommendations made by the Finance Commission are only of advisory nature and hence, not binding on the government. It is up to the Union government to implement its recommendations on granting money to the states."
