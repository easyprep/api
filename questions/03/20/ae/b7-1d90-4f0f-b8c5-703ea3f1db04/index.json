  "question": "&nbsp; Consider the following statements: <ol> <li>Hydroponics is the method of growing plants without soil, using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent</li> <li>Vermiponics is a soil-less growing technique that utilizes worm tea as nutrient solution</li> </ol> &nbsp; Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Vermiponics is a soil-less growing technique that combines hydroponics with vermiculture and utilizes worm tea as nutrient solution. Aquaculture is a system that is related to rising of aquatic animals such as snails, fish, crayfish or prawns in tanks along with cultivation of plants in a symbiotic environment. Worm tea is the liquid concentrate of worm compost. Minerals and microbial elements are extracted from the solid compost by actively brewing in water by means of an air pump which forces oxygen into the liquid."
