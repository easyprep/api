  "question": "During the early medieval era, in which among the following present states of India a Mason&#8217;s guild was working?",
  "option1": "Rajasthan",
  "option2": "Gujarat",
  "option3": "Karnataka",
  "option4": "Tamil Nadu",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Gujarat",
  "explanation": "The Gujarat Style was a judicious mix of Islamic and Indian traditions of architecture. The most notable point is that the masonâ€™s guilds worked here and these guilds were able to retain the high techniques of stone architecture and sculpture that had greatly developed in Gujarat before the Muslim invasion. This was a significant departure from the Sultanate monuments of Delhi, where the style used was relatively archaic. However, in Ahamadabad also, false domes and archs were used such as in Rani Sipri Mausoleum."
