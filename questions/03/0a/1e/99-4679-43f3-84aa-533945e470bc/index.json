  "question": "Why Pluto was removed from the category of planets?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It shares its orbit with Neptune</li>\r\n<li>Its gravity is not enough to keep it in spherical shape</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "The International Astronomical Union (IAU) has defined three conditions for a celestial object to be called a planet. The three conditions prescribed by the IAU are\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It must orbit the Sun.</li>\r\n<li>It should be massive enough to acquire an approximately spherical shape.</li>\r\n<li>It has to clear its orbit i.e. it must be the object that exerts the maximum gravitational pull within its orbit.  If an object ventures close to a planet’s orbit, it will either collide with it and be accreted or would be ejected out. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Why Pluto was removed from the category of planets?</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pluto is affected by Neptune’s gravity.</li>\r\n<li>Pluto shares its orbit with the frozen objects in the Kuiper belt.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAs a result Pluto was removed from the category of planets and was termed as dwarf planet as Dwarf planets need satisfy other two conditions only.\r\n<strong>About International Astronomical Union:</strong>\r\nThe mission of the IAU is to promote and safeguard the science of astronomy in all its aspects through international cooperation. It was founded in 1919."
