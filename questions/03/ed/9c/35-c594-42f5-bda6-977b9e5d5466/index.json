  "question": "Which of the following rocks formed from the existing rocks by undergoing the process of recrystallization?",
  "option1": "Igneous rocks",
  "option2": "Metamorphic rocks",
  "option3": "Sedimentary rocks",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Metamorphic rocks",
  "explanation": "The type of rocks that are formed from existing rocks through recrystallization are known as metamorphic rocks.  The word metamorphic means ‘change of form’.\r\nIgneous rocks are formed by the solidification of hot molten material called magma or lava. The word igneous is derived from the Latin word ‘ignis’ meaning fire.\r\nSedimentary rocks are formed by the deposition of sediments of rocks by exogenous forces. The word ‘sedimentary’ is derived from the Latin word sedimentum, which means settling."
