  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nMichelin star system is a rating system used to rate restaurants based on 5 criteria: ingredients quality, chefâ€™s personality in his/ her cuisine, consistency, value for money and mastery of flavours and cooking technique. A restaurant can earn a maximum of 3 Michelin Stars.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe Michelin Star system applies to those countries where a Michelin Guide exists. India is yet to get a Michelin Guide and hence not covered by the system. Some of the Asian regions covered by this system are Japan, Macau, Hong Kong, Seoul, etc."
