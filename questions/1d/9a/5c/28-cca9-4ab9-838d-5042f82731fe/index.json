  "explanation": "India has started producing 'Civet Coffee' the most expensive coffee in the world, in Karnataka. Civet Coffee is made from the feces of a species of cat called 'Civet Cat'. Civet cats eat the flesh of the coffee cherries and digest the coffee beans as whole. This induces a flavour into the coffee beans. The coffee beans are then collected from the feces of the Civet Cat.",
