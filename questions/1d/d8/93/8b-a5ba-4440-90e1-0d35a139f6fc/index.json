  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "<p class=\\\"Explanation\\\">Whereas the solar calendar is usually used for astrological purposes, the lunar calendar is important for religious life. The lunar calendar is used to measure the two eras still used for dating history: the Vikram era (fifty-six or fifty-seven years later than the common era) and the Shaka era (seventy-eight years earlier than the common era). in the Shaka era it begins with the sunâ€™s transition into Aries, determined in India as falling on April 14. Hence, to convert a Shaka era date to a common era date, one adds seventy-nine years for dates from January 1 to April 14, and seventy-eight years for dates from April 15 to December 31."
