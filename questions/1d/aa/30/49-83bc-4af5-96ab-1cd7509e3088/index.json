  "question": "If water contracts on freezing, which of the following would happen?",
  "option1": "Icebergs will completely float on the surface of water",
  "option2": "Ice would become more dense",
  "option3": "Lakes would freeze from top to bottom",
  "option4": "Rocks will crack due to freezing or internal water",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Ice would become more dense",
  "explanation": "When liquid water is cooled, it contracts like one would expect until a temperature of approximately 4 degrees Celsius is reached. After that, it expands slightly until it reaches the freezing point, and then when it freezes it expands by approximately 9%.Ice becomes more dense when water contracts."
