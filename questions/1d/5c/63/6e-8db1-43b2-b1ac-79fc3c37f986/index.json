  "question": "A man rows a boat 18 kilometers in 4 hours downstream and returns upstream in 12 hours. The speed of the (in km/hr) stream is :",
  "option1": "1 km/hr",
  "option2": "1.5 km/hr",
  "option3": "1.75 km/hr",
  "option4": "2 km/hr",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1.5 km/hr",
  "explanation": "Rate downstream = $latex \\\\frac{18}{4}=\\\\frac{9}{2} km/hr&s=1$\r\nRate upstream = $latex \\\\frac{18}{12}=\\\\frac{3}{2} km/hr&s=1$\r\nNow, speed of the stream = $latex \\\\frac{Rate Downstream - Rate Upstream }{2}&s=1$\r\n$latex =>\\\\frac{\\\\frac{9}{2}-\\\\frac{3}{2}}{2}=\\\\frac{6}{4}=\\\\frac{3}{2}&s=2$\r\n$latex =>1.5 km/hr$\r\nHence option [B] is the right answer."
