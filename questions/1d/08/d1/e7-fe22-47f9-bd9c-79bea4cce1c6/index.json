  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Cinder cone - It is a steep conical hill of loose pyroclastic fragments around a volcanic vent. Most cinder cones have a bowl shaped crater at the summit.<br />Geyser - It is a hot spring characterized by intermittent discharge of water ejected turbulently and accompanied by steam. They are generally associated with volcanic areas. They are generally aligned along faults.<br />Guyot - It is an isolated flat-topped underwater volcano mountain. They are also known as tablemount. They were first recognised by Harry Hess in 1945.<br />Seamount - A mountain rising from the ocean seafloor that does not reach to the water's surface is called a Seamount. They are typically formed of extinct volcanoes."
