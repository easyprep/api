  "explanation": "The Non-Governmental organisation, called ‘Pratham’ releases the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) in India. The ASER for the year 2019 was released recently. The report states that five-year-old children in private institutions performed better in learning activities than the same-aged children in Government-run schools and anganwadis.<br />The enrolment levels among girls in the age group of 4 to 8 years, were higher than those among boys. But more girls are being enrolled in state-run schools than boys, who are enrolled more in private schools, showing a clear gender gap."
