It is listed as a critically endangered species by the IUCN and is featured in the IUCN Red List. The species was earlier thought to be extinct but live specimens were discovered in 1994. There are fewer than 200 of these trees left.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Wollemi National park is located in Australiaâ€™s New South Wales. The Wollemi Pine trees are found only in Australia and are protected at this national park. It was in news recently when the firefighters undertook a covert operation to protect these trees from the bushfires."
