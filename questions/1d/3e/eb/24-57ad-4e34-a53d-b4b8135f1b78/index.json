  "answer": "as a bleaching agent and for purification of sugarcane juice giving white color to sugar",
  "explanation": "SO<sub>2</sub> is added in sugar manufacturing process because at initial stage it converts the basic character of treated sugar cane juice to neutral in character. During second time treatment of juice with SO<sub>2</sub>, it is used as a bleaching agent and leads to purification and responsible for white colour of sugar. The added sulphur leads to formation of hydrogen sulphides (H2S) which is a poisonous gas and is responsible for producing foul smell in industry. {<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/sweet-talk-is-white-sugar-minus-the-sulphur/\">Source of this question</a>}"
