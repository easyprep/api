  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Global Compact for Migration is also known as the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. It is not legally binding on the member states. It is not an international treaty. It was adopted on 19<sup>th</sup> December 2018 by the UN General Assembly.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Global Compact for Migration does not differentiate between legal and illegal migration. It only differentiates between regular and irregular migration. While countries like India voted in favour of this compact, some members like USA were against it. The global compact also recognises the sovereign rights of the states to determine their national migration policy."
