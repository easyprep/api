  "question": "Which of the following is true about universal gravitational constant in the case of two bodies each of unit mass having their centres placed at unit distance apart?",
  "option1": "It is equal to the force of attraction between them",
  "option2": "It is equal to twice the force of attraction between them",
  "option3": "It is equal to half the force of attraction between them",
  "option4": "It is equal to ten times the force of attraction between them",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "It is equal to the force of attraction between them",
  "explanation": "The universal gravitational constant is equal to the force of attraction between two bodies each of unit mass having their centres placed at unit distance apart. F = Gm<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub>/r When m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> = 1 and r=1 then F=G."
