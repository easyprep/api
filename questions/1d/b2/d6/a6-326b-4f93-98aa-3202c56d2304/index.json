  "answer": "Muhammad Hashim Khafi Khan",
  "explanation": "Muntakhab-ul-Lubab of Tarikh-i-Khafi Khan, by Muhammad Hashim Khafi Khan, is a voluminous history from the Muhammad conquest of India to the fourteenth year of the reign of Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah (1719-18). The first of its three-volume is from the Muhammadan conquest to the end of the Lodi dynasty, the second provides a full account of the Mughals in India from the conquest of Babur to the reign of Muhammad Shah and the third contains an entire account of the reign of Aurangzeb. Khafi Khan's history is more valuable for the reign of Shah Jahan as it is the work of a contemporary who was waqia-nawis at Agra and himself took part in the battle of Samugarh."
