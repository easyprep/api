The organisation is active in many places across the world.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nTRAFFIC had setup the Wildlife Sniffer Dog unit in India in 2008. The unit trains dog squads to help with conservation efforts. They are called Traffic’s super sniffers. They help in flushing out poachers from the sanctuaries. It has led to more than a 100 seizures. The “Canines for Felines” award was given to dogs that contributed to tiger conservation in India.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nTerai arc landscape is the region between River Yamuna and River Bhagmati. It is composed of Shivalik hills, Terai flood plains and the bhabhar geological area.
