  "question": "The first ever Hyperloop project in India, recently got a boost from the government. Which of the following statements about the project are correct?\n<ol>\n<li>It would make India the first country to officially commission a hyperloop.</li>\n<li>The Pune-Mumbai hyperloop project is declared ‘public infrastructure’.</li>\n<li>The pods of the hyperloop are to run on electricity.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 and 2",
  "option2": "None of the above",
  "option3": "2 and 3",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nIndia would be the first to officially commission a hyperloop route in the world. Hyperloop is a direct to destination mode of transport. It is a ground transport system that has the potential for transports faster than airliners- eg: 1100kmph speeds. The vehicle will travel through a tube, almost devoid of air. The absence of air will greatly reduce friction and enable greater speeds.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe Pune- Mumbai hyperloop route was declared “public infrastructure” which would enable it to avail credit and concessions with greater ease. The project has 2 components- 11.4km long test track construction and the final 117.5km long track. The project has a direct foreign investment worth 70,000 crore INR. It is to see 150 million passengers annually after completion.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe hyperloop is 100% electrified. Its use will cut down Greenhouse gas emission by about 150,000 tonnes annually. It will cut the travel time between Pune and Mumbai to 30 minutes from the current 3+ hours. The concept was introduced by Elon Musk (of Tesla and SpaceX). The project is to be implemented by Virgin Hyperloop One."
