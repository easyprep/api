If Karnataka receives Central government approval, it will be the second state after Jammu and Kashmir to have a flag. The flag is tricolor comprising yellow, white and red with State emblem at the centre. Now the proposal will be forwarded to the Union Home Ministry for approval, as a State is not empowered to declare its own flag. The state emblem is blue in colour named Gandaberunda. Gandaberunda is a mythical two-headed bird.",
