  "question": "An elephant and a feather are dropped off a very tall building from the same height at the same time. Which among the following statements is / are correct in this context?<br> 1. The elephant encounters a smaller force of air resistance than the feather and therefore falls faster.<br> 2. The elephant has a greater acceleration of gravity than the feather and therefore falls faster.<br> 3. Both elephant and feather have the same force of gravity, yet the acceleration of gravity is greatest for the elephant.<br> 4. Both elephant and feather have the same force of gravity, yet the feather experiences a greater air resistance.<br> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 3 are correct statements",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 4 are correct statements",
  "option3": "Only 1 is correct statement",
  "option4": "None of the 1, 2, 3 & 4 are correct statements",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of the 1, 2, 3 & 4 are correct statements",
  "explanation": "The presence of air affects the motion of falling bodies partly through buoyancy and partly through air resistance. Thus two different objects falling in air from the same height will not, in general, reach the ground at exactly the same time. Because air resistance increases with velocity, eventually a falling body reaches a terminal velocity that depends on its mass, size, and shape, and it cannot fall any faster than that.
