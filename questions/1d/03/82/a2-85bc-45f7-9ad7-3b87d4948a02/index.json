  "question": "In context with the recent discussions about ‘bone ossification’, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is a process of destruction of bones.</li>\n<li>It is used to determine age.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nBone ossification is the process of bone formation. Bone formation is done by cells called osteoblasts. It is also known as osteogenesis and commences 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> week of the foetal development. The process is completed only during a person’s 25<sup>th</sup> year.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nBone ossification is used in forensic analysis to determine the age of an individual. The bones in younger humans have cartilaginous ends with a bony shaft. The cartilage is replaced by bones as they grow older. However the ossification test results by themselves is not considered as conclusive evidence by the judiciary."
