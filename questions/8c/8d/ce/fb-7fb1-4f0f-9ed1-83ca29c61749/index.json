  "question": "Which of the following Indian institutes has developed an anti cancer anti-inflamatory drug conjugated to the human serum Albumin?",
  "option1": "Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute",
  "option2": "AIIMS",
  "option3": "National Institute of Biomedical Genomics",
  "option4": "Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute",
  "explanation": "The Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) has recently developed an anti cancer anti-inflamatory drug conjugated to the human serum Albumin. It is an intravenous delivery system, enabling 100 fold increase in drug bio-availability and is a mix of human serum albumin and a plant based drug. This combination is the first of its kind as human albumin which is more compatible to the human body is being used. Clinical trials in humans have to be completed and results assessed as the ensuing steps towards commercialisation. The institute has also developed the technology of isothermal based DNA amplification device to detect TB bacterium in sputum samples in less than 30 minutes. Nearly 2-3 million people are infected with Tuberculosis and the prevalence of totally drug resistant TB (TDR-TB) is very high in India. The TB screening device employs a nucleic acid amplification technique to detect TB in less than 30 minutes with high specificity and without false positives. It can simultaneously screen 20 patient samples in one assay and at considerably lower cost than the existing devices ( costs approx Rs 2500/ sample). The device will also help in mass screening of population of people for TB at a substantially low cost."
