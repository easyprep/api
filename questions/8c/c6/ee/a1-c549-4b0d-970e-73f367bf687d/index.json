  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Nitrous oxide and sulphur dioxide",
  "explanation": "Acid rain results when sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>X</sub>) are emitted into the atmosphere and transported by wind and air currents. The SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>X</sub> react with water, oxygen and other chemicals to form sulfuric and nitric acids. These then mix with water and other materials before falling to the ground."
