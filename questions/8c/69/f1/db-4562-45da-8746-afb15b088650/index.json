  "question": "The Government of India fixes the Minimum Support Prices after taking into account the recommendations of which among the following bodies?",
  "option1": "Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution",
  "option2": "Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs",
  "option3": "NITI Aayog",
  "option4": "Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices",
  "explanation": "Assurance of a remunerative and stable price environment is considered very important for increasing agricultural production and productivity since the market place for agricultural produce tends to be inherently unstable, which often inflict undue losses on the growers, even when they adopt the best available technology package and produce efficiently. Towards this end, minimum support prices (MSP) for major agricultural products are fixed by the government, each year, after taking into account the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP)."
