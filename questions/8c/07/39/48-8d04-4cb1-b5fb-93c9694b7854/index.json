  "option1": "Germany",
  "option2": "France",
  "option3": "Italy",
  "option4": "Switzerland",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "France",
  "explanation": "The official seat of the European Parliament is located in Strasbourg, the capital and largest city of the Grand Est region of France. The Parliament is based in three different cities with numerous buildings. A protocol attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam requires that 12 plenary sessions be held in Strasbourg (none in August but two in September), which is the Parliament's official seat, while extra part sessions, as well as committee meetings, are held in Brussels. Luxembourg City hosts the Secretariat of the European Parliament. The European Parliament is one of at least two assemblies in the world with more than one meeting place (another being the parliament of the Isle of Man, Tynwald) and one of the few that does not have the power to decide its own location."
