  "question": "The Himalayan Cloud Observatory has been set up in which district of Uttarakhand?",
  "option1": "Bageshwar",
  "option2": "Pithoragarh",
  "option3": "Tehri Garhwal",
  "option4": "Rudraprayag",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Tehri Garhwal",
  "explanation": "The Himalayan Cloud Observatory has recently been set up in the SRT campus Chamba of Tehri Garhwal district in Uttarakhand to receive forecast and monitor cloud burst incidents in the Himalayan region and help minimise the damage. This is the second observatory in the country to monitor cloud activities by the Indian Science and Technology (IST) Department and Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur that can function in high-altitudes. The cloudburst incidents are very frequent in the hilly areas of Uttarakhand and resulted in a huge loss of life. The Himalayan Cloud Observatory has recently prepared a six-month data while being in the testing period, so that after the completion of the testing period, cloud bursting incidents in future could be easily predicted and the severe loss of lives and property caused to the localities due to this could be stopped."
