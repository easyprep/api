  "option1": "Embarrass the British amid war chaos",
  "option2": "Seek independence",
  "option3": "Affirm right to speech",
  "option4": "All of above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Affirm right to speech",
  "explanation": "The Congress was in a confused state again after the August Offer. The radicals and leftists wanted to launch a mass Civil Disobedience Movement, but here Gandhi insisted on Individual Satyagraha. The Individual Satyagraha was not to seek independence but to affirm the right of speech. The first Satyagrahi selected was Acharya Vinoba Bhave, who was sent to Jail when he spoke against the war."
