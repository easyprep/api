  "question": "With respect to MP government constituting a panel to investigate AYUSH doctors practicing allopathy, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The prescription of allopathic medicines by AYUSH practitioners is disallowed in all Indian states.</li>\n<li>The National Medical Commission Bill provides full license to community health providers to practice medicine.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nNot all states disallow the practice of allopathy by AYUSH practitioners. States like TN, UP, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, etc. allow the practice on basis of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945. The SC in 1987 allowed the practice by means of state order.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe National Medical Commission Bill, 2019 has a provision to enable mid-level practitioners to practice allopathy and prescribe allopathic medicines. However, these community health providers get only limited license. The medical community had opposed the provision, claiming that it will encourage quackery.\n&nbsp;"
