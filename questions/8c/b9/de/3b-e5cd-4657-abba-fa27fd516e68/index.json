  "question": "With reference to the agricultural production and productivity, the Western States such as Punjab, Haryana and Western UP contribute more in the central pool in comparison to Eastern States. Consider the following statements is this regard:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The higher contribution by western states is mainly because of better access to irrigation</li>\r\n<li>The irrigation in western states is predominantly via groundwater sources</li>\r\n<li>The eastern states are more vulnerable to natural calamities such as floods, cyclones, drought</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "<p class=\\\"Notes\\\">The higher agricultural production and productivity in western region is mainly because of access to irrigation which is predominantly from ground water sources. Significant contribution of food-grains to the central pool is at the cost of annual negative balance in the ground water reserves for these states. There is, therefore, need for water conservation and management measures in this region focusing on water saving and productivity enhancement technologies to ensure that it does not adversely affect the overall farm economies and more importantly, its contribution to the food buffer stock."
