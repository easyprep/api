  "question": "Which among the following can induce the formation of Ground Level Ozone?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Nitrogen Oxides</li>\r\n<li>Carbon Dioxide</li>\r\n<li>Methane</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "Its not CO2 that plays role in making of the Ground Level Ozone. Ground Level Ozone is formed from the Nitrogen Oxides, CO and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). The Ground Level Ozone is also called the Tropospheric Ozone. In the last 100 years the emission of Methane, which is a Volatile Organic Compound has increased dramatically and it has contributed to the Ground Level Ozone formation."
