  "explanation": "The least distance of distinct vision (LDDV) or the reference seeing distance (RSD) is the closest someone with \"normal\" vision (20/20 vision) can comfortably look at something. The range of vision of a healthy human eye is between it's near point and far point i.e, from 25cm to infinity."
