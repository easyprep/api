  "option1": "$latex 44$",
  "option2": "$latex 45\\frac{1}{2}&s=1$",
  "option3": "$latex 45$",
  "option4": "$latex 46\\frac{1}{2}&s=1$",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "$latex 45$",
  "explanation": "Required average $latex = \\\\frac{32\\\\times 60 + 33\\\\times 40}{72}&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{1920+1320}{72} = \\\\frac{3240}{72} = 45&s=1$\r\nHence option [C] is the right answer."
