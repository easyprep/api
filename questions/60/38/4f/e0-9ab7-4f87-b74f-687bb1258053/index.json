  "question": "The European Central Bank/ ECB cut its interest rates to a record low of -0.5%. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Negative Interest Rate Policy is used to stimulate economic growth.</li>\r\n<li>NIRP is used during deflation.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe ECB had cut the rates to record low because of the economic crisis faced by the euro zone. The NIRP is being used by several central banks since 1990s. The current step was taken to tackle the threats from protectionist policies and slow growth by decreasing money hoarding.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:        </strong>\r\nNIRP is used to tackle deflation. During deflation, individuals tend to hoard money rather than spend it. This results in drop in demand and rise in unemployment. Banks charge such hoarding to incentivise buying tendencies. This is by use of rates below 0%. The NIRP is an unconventional monetary tool. \r\n&nbsp;"
