  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nVyomamitra is a half-humanoid robot developed by ISRO. Its name is derived from the Sanskrit terms ‘’vyoma’ meaning space and ‘mitra’ meaning friend. It is referred to as ‘half humanoid’ because it still doesn’t have ‘leg’ structure for greater mobility.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Vyomamitra is a prototype for use in the Gaganyaan unmanned mission- the component of the Gaganyaan project that will precede India’s first ever manned mission to space. It is to simulate human functions in space, perform life support operations and monitor various parameters using voice command."
