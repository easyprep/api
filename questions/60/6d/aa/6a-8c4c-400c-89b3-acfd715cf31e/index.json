  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Georgia",
  "explanation": "Georgia's intangible cultural heritage is \"Berikaoba Dance\". Berikaoba is an improvised masqueraded folk theatre in Georgia, stemming from the pagan festivity of fertility and rebirth. The name is derived from a Common Kartvelian root ber, meaning \"a child\". The scenes of Berikaoba range from those of explicitly erotic nature to political satire and social protest. Berikaoba typically involves several men, the berika, who are mostly disguised as animals. The costumes and masks for the mystery are made of animal hide. Animal skulls, tails, feathers, horns, pumpkins, ribbons and bells are used to add colourfulness to the scene. The festivity begins with a gathering of villagers who chose actors for the mystery."
