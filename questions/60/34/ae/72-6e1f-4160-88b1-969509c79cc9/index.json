  "question": "Which of the following is incorrect:",
  "option1": "Gravitational force of attraction is independent of nature of intervening medium",
  "option2": "Gravitational forces are central forces",
  "option3": "Gravitational forces are non-conservative forces",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Gravitational forces are non-conservative forces",
  "explanation": "Characteristics of Gravitational Forces:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It is always attractive in nature.</li>\r\n<li>It is independent of the medium between the bodies.</li>\r\n<li>It holds good over a wide range of distances</li>\r\n<li>It is a central force i.e. acts along the line joining the centres of two interacting bodies</li>\r\n<li>The gravitational force between two particles is independent of the presence or absence of other bodies</li>\r\n<li>It is the weakest force in nature.</li>\r\n<li>It is a conservative force i.e. work done by it is path independent or work done in moving a particle round a closed path under the action of gravitational force is zero.</li>\r\n<li>It is an action-reaction pair.</li>\r\n</ol>"
