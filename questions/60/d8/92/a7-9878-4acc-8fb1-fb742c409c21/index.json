  "question": "MeerKAT, which has captured high-quality imaging of a PKS 2014-55 galaxy, is a satellite of which country?",
  "option1": "South Korea",
  "option2": "Israel",
  "option3": "South Africa",
  "option4": "United States",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "South Africa",
  "explanation": "According to the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO), using the high-quality imaging of a galaxy called PKS 2014-55, sent by the South African satellite MeerKAT, the ‘X’ galaxies were found to be of a ‘double boomerang’ shape.\r\nThe galaxy that is located 800 million light years from Earth, is classified as ‘X-shaped’ because of its appearance from previous blurry images. The study also showed that these structures ultimately turn black due to the pressure of tenuous intergalactic gas."
