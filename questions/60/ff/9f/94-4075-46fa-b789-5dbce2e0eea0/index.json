Now, the bill - Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Bill, 2018 - will be introduced in the Parliament for certain amendments in the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950. The bill proposes deletion of the Abor tribe from the state\\'s ST list \\\"as it is the same as Adi\\\" tribe. The bill seeks to include the Mishmi-Kaman (Miju Mishmi), Idu (Mishmi) and Taraon (Digaru Mishmi) tribes in the list. It also proposes inclusion of \\\"Monpa, Memba, Sartang, Sajolong in lieu of the Momba\\\" tribe. The Nocte, Tangsa, Tutsa and Wancho tribes would replace the words \\\"any Naga tribe\\\" in the state\\'s ST list. As there is no tribe called \\\"Khampti\\\", the bill replaces it with \\\"Tai Khamti\\\" on the list."
