  "question": "A man borrows 21000 Rs. at 10% compound interest. How much he has to pay annually at the end of each year, to settle his loan in two years?",
  "option1": "12000 Rs.",
  "option2": "12100 Rs.",
  "option3": "12200 Rs.",
  "option4": "12300 Rs.",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "12100 Rs.",
  "explanation": "If each instalment be x, then present worth of first instalment\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{x}{1+\\\\frac{10}{100}} = \\\\frac{10x}{11}&s=1$\r\nPresent worth of second instalment\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{x}{\\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{10}{100} \\\\right )^{2}} = \\\\frac{100x}{121}&s=1$\r\n$latex \\\\therefore \\\\frac{10x}{11}+\\\\frac{100x}{121}=21000&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{110x+100x}{121} = 21000&s=1$\r\n$latex => 210x = 21000\\\\times 121&s=1$\r\n$latex => x = \\\\frac{21000\\\\times 121}{210} = 12100\\\\ Rs.&s=1$\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer."
