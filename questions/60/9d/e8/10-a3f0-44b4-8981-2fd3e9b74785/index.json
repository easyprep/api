  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Ganga Volga Dialogue was held in January between India and Russia. The maiden dialogue held in Delhi to improve cooperation between the two countries was conceptualised in 2018 during the India- Russia Summit. The River Volga is a major river system in Russia like how River Ganga is to India.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Ganga Volga Dialogue was conceptualised as a track 1.5 dialogue. The term track 1.5 is used in diplomacy to refer to dialogues involving both official and non-official actors from both sides. The dialogue is expected to increase privileged strategic partnership between the two countries."
