The Court took cognizance of all civil cases including property, inheritance, succession, caste, marriage, contracts, accounts etc. The cases relating to caste, religion, marriage and inheritance of the native were to be decided according to their usages and customs of Hindu law for Hindus and Muslim law for Mohammedans was applied. The Collector being an Englishman, was ignorant about the personal laws of natives, hence he was assisted by native laws officers called Kazi and Pandits who expounded the law to him. The Court held its sittings twice a week in open court. The matters relating to succession to Zamindari and Taluqdari property could not be submitted to Mofussil Court as they were reserved for the Governor and Council. Appeals from these courts were to be heard by the Sadar Diwani Adalat at Calcutta where the subject-matter of the case exceeded rupees five hundred. Later under Cornwallis plan, the Collector was replaced by Diwan."
