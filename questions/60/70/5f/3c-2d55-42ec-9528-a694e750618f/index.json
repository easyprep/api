  "question": "<p>Which among the following is a crystalline form of Quartz?</p>",
  "option1": "Alumina",
  "option2": "Glass",
  "option3": "Silica",
  "option4": "Limestone",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Silica",
  "explanation": "<p>Silica is synonymous with silicon dioxide (SiO2). Silicon and oxygen are the two most abundant elements in the earth’s crust. Silica is commonly found in nature as sand. Silica exists in many different forms that can be crystalline as well as non-crystalline (amorphous). Quartz is the most common form of crystalline silica and is the second most common mineral on the earth’s surface. It is found in almost every type of rock i.e. igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary. Since it is so abundant, quartz is present in nearly all mining operations. Silica, or silicon dioxide (SiO2), is a group IV metal oxide, which naturally occurs in both crystalline and amorphous forms. The various forms of crystalline silica are α-quartz, β-quartz, α-tridymite, β-tridymite, α-cristobalite, β-cristobalite, keatite, coesite, stishovite, and moganite. The most abundant form of silica is α-quartz, and the term quartz is often used in place of the general term crystalline silica.</p>"
