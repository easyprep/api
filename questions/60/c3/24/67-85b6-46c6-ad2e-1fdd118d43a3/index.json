  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Made Snana is a religious practice of Hindus where the devotees (many Dalits) are made to roll over the food left over by the upper caste people. The practice is believed to cure skin diseases and other ailments apart from removing ‘bad karma’.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Made Snana is most associated with Karnataka, especially Dakshina Kannada region. The practice is considered illegal but the rolling over ‘prasada’ and food left over by cows is still continued. The recently notified anti-superstition law makes even this voluntary."
