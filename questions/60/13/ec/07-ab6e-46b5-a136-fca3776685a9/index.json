  "question": "In recent times, manmade or constructed wetlands are helping a lot in environment production. What are benefits of constructed wetlands?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>They provide cost effective alternative to water storage systems</li>\r\n<li>They are suitable for Indian tropical conditions</li>\r\n<li>They can effectively treat waste water</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Natural wetlands purify water by breaking down and assimilating nutrients, bacteria, and other contaminants. Wetlands can be designed and constructed to take advantage of these naturally occurring processes to treat wastewater from a variety of sources. Please note that Constructed wetlands:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>provide a cost effective alternative to liquid storage systems</li>\r\n<li>help to ensure that water resources are protected from contaminants</li>\r\n<li>provide valuable wildlife habitat</li>\r\n<li>require very low maintenance and take advantage of processes that occur in nature</li>\r\n<li>look natural and add to the appearance of the farm.</li>\r\n<li>good for Indian conditions as tropical climate is ideal for the working of the system</li>\r\n</ol>"
