  "question": "Recently, Pusa Mustard-30 developed by the IARI was making in news. How Pusa Mustard-30 is different from normal mustard variety? <ol> <li>It has low erucic acid content and much less pungent than normal mustard</li> <li>It is high-yielding and early-maturing mustard when compared to normal mustard.</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "First statement is partially correct. Pusa-Mustard-30 is low in erucic acid  but more pungent than normal mustard. Pusa Mustard-30 lacks in glucosinolates, organic compounds that catalyse reactions in the broken seeds imparting the pungent taste associated with mustard oil. While the glucosinolates content in Indian mustard is about 150 micromoles per gram of seeds, it is less than 30 for canola or Pusa Mustard. Normal mustard has 40-50 % erucic acid content which has toxic effects on the heart at high enough doses. But Pusa Mustard-30 has only 2-3 % erucic acid content. Furthermore, Pusa Mustard-30 also offers high crop yields. The seed yields are 11-12 quintals per acre, with 40 per cent oil content. This is as good as what farmers are getting from regular mustard varieties. Pusa Mustard-30 has been under large cultivation area of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan this Rabi season."
