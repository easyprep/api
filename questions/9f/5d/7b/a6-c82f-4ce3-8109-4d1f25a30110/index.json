  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Ireland",
  "explanation": "Ireland will impose a so-called \\\"latte levy\\\" on disposable coffee cups by 2021 in a bid to change consumer habits and cut the environmental impact from the use of single-use plastics. The proposed levy of up to 0.25 euros per cup will encourage coffee drinkers to instead carry around reusable \\\"Keep Cups\\\" that already allow customers to claim a discount in some coffee shops."
