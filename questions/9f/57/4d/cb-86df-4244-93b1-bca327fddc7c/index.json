  "answer": "rainfall above 100 cm, temperature above 25°C",
  "explanation": "Rice being a tropical and sub-tropical plant, requires a fairly high temperature, ranging from 20° to 40°C. The optimum temperature of 30°C during day time and 20°C during night time is considered favorable for its growth and development.<br />Although the regions are having average annual rainfall between 175—300 cm are the most suitable. Paddy also needs flooded conditions with the depth of water varying over 25 mm at the time of transplanting to as much as 150 mm for 10 weeks of the growing period."
