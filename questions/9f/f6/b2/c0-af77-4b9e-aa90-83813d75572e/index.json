  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct because the panchayats are entitled to receive grant in aid directly from the central government. The 14th Finance Commission which covers the period between 2015 and 2020 states that the commission has fixed the grant of Rs. 2 lakh crores to Panchayats which is three times more than the grant of the 13th Finance Commission. Second statement is also correct because the members of the Gram&nbsp;Panchayats&nbsp;have&nbsp;tenure&nbsp;of&nbsp;five years&nbsp;and are directly elected from wards."
