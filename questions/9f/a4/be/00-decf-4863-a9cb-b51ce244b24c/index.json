  "answer": "1 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe COPUOS was established in 1959 after the launch of Sputnik. The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs is the secretariat for this committee. The committee oversees the implementation of 5 treaties like the Outer space treaty, rescue agreement, etc. China is a member of this committee.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nMoon treaty is one of the 5 treaties that are overseen by the COPUOS. It is also called the Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and other Celestial Bodies. It is considered a failed treaty as many states aren’t party to it- including China. India is one among the few signatories.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nChina’s Chang’e-4 mission makes it the first country to soft land on the far side of moon. It is the second phase of Chinese Lunar Exploration Program. The far side of the moon is the side that always faces away from the earth, making it a subject of significant scientific interest. It has one of the largest craters of the solar system."
