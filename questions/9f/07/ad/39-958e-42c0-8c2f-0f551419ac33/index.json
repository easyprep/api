  "explanation": "Lenin Moreno has recently taken office as new President of Ecuador, after defeating his conservative rival & ex-banker Guillermo Lasso, by 2.3% in April\\'s runoff vote. He served as Vice President from 2007 to 2013, serving under President Rafael Correa. Moreno is the first wheelchair-user to become Ecuador\\'s leader and one of few such leaders in the world ever to serve as president. His legs have been paralyzed since he was shot during a robbery in 1998. He went on to lead a task force on disability rights as vice-president in Correa\\'s government. That earned him a nomination for a Nobel Peace Prize in 2012."
