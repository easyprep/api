  "question": "The Karnataka High Court recently made observations on the article 25 of Indian Constitution. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It gives the right to propagate any religion.</li>\n<li>The article does not extend to public roads and footpaths.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe article 25 gives the right to freely profess, practice and propagate a religion of one’s choosing. Articles 25 through 28 give the freedom of religion as a fundamental right. However, the article’s provision is subject to public order, health and morality.\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Karnataka High Court held that the provision of article 25 does not extend to public places like roads and footpaths. It held that the article does not give the right to block such public places for religious purposes. Erecting temporary structures in such public places for religious purposes is permitted only after ensuring that they don’t cause disruption of traffic."
