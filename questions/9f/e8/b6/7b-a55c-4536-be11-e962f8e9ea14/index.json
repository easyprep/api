  "question": "As per the Newton's second law of motion, what is the relation between the rate of change of linear momentum and the external force applied?",
  "option1": "directly proportional",
  "option2": "inversely proportional",
  "option3": "independent of each other",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "inversely proportional",
  "explanation": "As per the Newton's second law of motion, the rate of change of linear momentum of a body is inversely proportional to the external force applied on the body. This change always takes place in the direction of the force applied."
