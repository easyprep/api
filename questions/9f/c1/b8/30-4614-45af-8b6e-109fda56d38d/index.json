In it, RBI reduced the policy repo rate under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) by 35 basis points (bps) from 5.75% to 5.40% with immediate effect. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands revised to 5.15%, and the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 5.65%. This is the 4th straight time that the RBI has cut interest rates. The move is said to give a fillip to the economy.
