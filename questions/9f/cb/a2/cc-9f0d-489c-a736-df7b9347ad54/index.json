  "question": "Why the Polar orbits are considered to be suitable for Earth-mapping? <br />1. Polar orbits are in a plane that is almost perpendicular to the plane of the equator<br />2. The satellites in Polar Orbits are at a proximity to earth in comparison to Low Earth Orbits so that better image output can be achieved <br />3. A spot on the Earthâ€™s surface can be sensed continuously from a satellite in a polar orbit<br />Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3 are correct",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "Polar orbits are in a plane that is almost perpendicular to the plane of the equator. They offer a great coverage which is needed for mapping. A spot cannot be seen continuously as it covers the entire earth."
