  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "1 Only",
  "option3": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 & 2 Only",
  "explanation": "An oxbow lake is a U-shaped body of water that forms when a wide meander from the main stem of a river is cut off, creating a free-standing body of water. A canyon is a deep ravine between pairs of cliffs and is the most often carved landscape by the erosive activity of a river. A moraine is any glacially formed accumulation of unconsolidated glacial debris that occurs in both currently and formerly glaciated regions. Barchan is a crescent shaped dune formed by aeolian action."
