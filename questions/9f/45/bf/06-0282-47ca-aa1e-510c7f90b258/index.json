  "answer": "Kidney trouble",
  "explanation": "Dialysis has been used since the 1940s to treat people with kidney problems. Dialysis is a treatment that filters and purifies the blood using a machine. This helps keep your fluids and electrolytes in balance when the kidneys can\\'t do their job.<br />When kidneys fail, dialysis keeps your body in balance by removing waste, salt and extra water to prevent them from building up in the body and keeping a safe level of certain chemicals in your blood, such as potassium, sodium and bicarbonate."
