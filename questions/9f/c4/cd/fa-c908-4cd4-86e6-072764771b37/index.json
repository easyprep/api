  "question": "Keeping a fixed incident ray of light, if a plane mirror is rotated with an angle of 20°, the reflected ray will turn by which among the following values?",
  "option1": "10°",
  "option2": "20°",
  "option3": "30°",
  "option4": "40°",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "40°",
  "explanation": "Before the mirror has rotated, the angle of incidence is taken ? as is the angle of reflection. If the mirror is rotated through an angle f the normal is rotated by an angle f and thus the angle of incidence increases to ? +f. Therefore, the angle of reflection must also increase by f to ?+f The difference between the final angle of reflection and the initial angle of reflection and is 2f."
