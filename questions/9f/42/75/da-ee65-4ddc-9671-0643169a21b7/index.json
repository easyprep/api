As per the report, India leads the region in all other areas of competitiveness except for health, education and skills. It further added that India has invested more heavily on transport infrastructure and services. As per the report, India\\'s greatest competitive advantages include its market size and innovation. Among the BRICS economies, China topped the list at 28th place. India, however, remained the \\\"South Asia\\'s main driving force\\\". The GCI 4.0 is a composite indicator that assesses the set of factors that determine an economy\\'s level of productivity - widely considered as the most important determinant of long-term growth."
