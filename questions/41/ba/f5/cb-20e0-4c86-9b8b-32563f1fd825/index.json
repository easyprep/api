  "answer": "Pastoral Herding",
  "explanation": "Pastoral herding is the simplest form of pastoral activity. People engaged in this activity graze animals on natural pastures and they migrate from place to place in search of pasture. They may lead a settled life for some time in one location till the grazing lasts, but eventually move to fresh pastures as the grazing becomes more scarce in that area."
