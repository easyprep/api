  "question": "India's first industrial solar microgrid factory was set up in which state?",
  "option1": "Telangana",
  "option2": "Uttarkhand",
  "option3": "Bihar",
  "option4": "Gujarat",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Gujarat",
  "explanation": "Swedish-Swiss multinational giant ABB announced commissioning of India's first industrial solar microgrid at its factory in Vadodara, Gujarat. Microgrid is a localized electricity source which can function autonomously as well as by connecting and being synced with the traditional centralized electrical grid (macrogrid). Microgrids with integrated battery energy storage is primarily setup to ensure continuity of work during planned and unplanned power outages. ABB's Mircrogrid (having rooftop photovoltaic field and battery-energy storage system) at its factory in Vadodara will harness the solar energy and will thus help in meeting the growing electricity needs.
