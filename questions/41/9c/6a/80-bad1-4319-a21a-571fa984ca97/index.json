  "question": "Which law shows the reduction in marginal utility with an increase in the consumption of a commodity?",
  "option1": "Diminishing marginal utility",
  "option2": "Utility maximization",
  "option3": "Utility minimization",
  "option4": "Consumer equilibrium",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Diminishing marginal utility",
  "explanation": "The Law Of Diminishing Marginal Utility states that with everything equal as consumption increases the marginal utility derived from each additional unit declines. As more and more units of a commodity are consumed, the marginal utility derived from each successive unit goes on falling as the intensity of want for the commodity declines."
