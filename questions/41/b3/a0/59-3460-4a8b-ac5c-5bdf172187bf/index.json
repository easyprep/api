The &#8220;letter of credit&#8221; and &#8220;bank guarantees&#8221; fall into the category of non-funding loans. The non-funding loan can be converted to a fund-based advance if the client fails to fulfil the term of contract with the counterparty. In banking language, the non-funding advances are called Contingent Liability of the banks. <a href=\"http://www.gktoday.in/reference/types-of-loans-in-india/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.gktoday.in/reference/types-of-loans-in-india/</a>"
