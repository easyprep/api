  "answer": "Dibang Valley",
  "explanation": "<strong>Dibang Valley</strong> Dibang Valley region is located in Arunachal Pradesh. The Mishmi hills, a southward extension of the Himalayas, compose most of the northern part of the region. The region derives its name from the Dibang river. The Dibang, together with the Ahui, Emra, Adzon, and Dri streams, flows southward to join the Brahmaputra river. Subtropical evergreen forests of oak, maple, juniper, and pine cover the hilly parts of the region. The Mishmi, Miju, Idu (Chulikatta), Khampti, and Singpho ethnic groups inhabit the region and speak dialects of the Tibeto-Burman linguistic family. Rice, maize, millet, potatoes, and cotton are grown on the terraced hill slopes and in the more level patches bordering the rivers. Barter markets are important to the regional economy; the Mishmi trade musk, beeswax, ginger, and chillies with the people of the Assam plains to the south. Deposits of clay, graphite, limestone, and copper are worked. Cottage industries include caneworking, cloth weaving, silverworking, and black-smithing. The system of roads in the Dibang valley region is largely undeveloped. Most distances are travelled over simple tracks, though there are a few all-weather roads. Anini is the chief settlement in the region. The Igu, a sombre dance performed by the Idu Mishmi priests, is closely associated with the region."
