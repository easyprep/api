  "explanation": "The Cinema Impero is an Art Deco-style cinema in Asmara, the capital of Eritrea. It was built in 1937 by the colonial authorities in Italian Eritrea and designed by Mario Messina. Cinema Impero was the largest movie theatre constructed in Asmara during the last period of the Italian colony of Eritrea. It was named after the conquest of Ethiopia by Benito Mussolini and his proclamation of the Italian Empire. The building still houses a cinema today, and it is considered by the experts one of the world's finest examples of Art DÃ©co style building. Cinema Impero is still preserved after 70 years, escaping damage during the several conflicts over the past century. It is a tourist attraction in modern Asmara, along with the famous Fiat Tagliero Building and some other Italian-period structures including the Presidential Palace and the City Hall."
