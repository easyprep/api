  "question": "Consider the following statements:<br />I. The Richter Scale is a logarithmic scale and so an increase of one magnitude unit represents a factor of 10 times in amplitude.<br />II. Each integer reading of the Richter scale has an energy 100 times that of the previous integer reading.<br />Which of the statements given above is/are correct?",
  "option1": "I only",
  "option2": "II only",
  "option3": "Both I and II",
  "option4": "Neither I nor II",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "I only",
  "explanation": "The magnitude of intensity of energy released by an earthquake is measured by Richter Scale. The number indicating magnitude on Richter Scale ranges between 0 and 9 but infact the scale has no upper limited of number because it is a logarithmic scale. But each integer reading of the Richter scale has in energy 32 times of previous integer reading. So the statement is not correct."
