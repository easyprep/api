  "question": "The Uri Dam is located on which river in Jammu &amp; Kashmir (J&amp;K)?",
  "option1": "Beas River",
  "option2": "Chenab River",
  "option3": "Ravi River",
  "option4": "Jhelum River",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Jhelum River",
  "explanation": "The Uri Dam is a 480 MW hydroelectric power station on the Jhelum River near Uri in Baramula district of the Jammu and Kashmir (J&amp;K). It is located very near to the Line of Control, the de facto border between India and Pakistan. The station is largely built under a hill with a 10 km tunnel. It is of the run-of-the-river type without a large dam, since the Indus Waters Treaty gives Pakistan the exclusive right to regulate the Jhelum River."
