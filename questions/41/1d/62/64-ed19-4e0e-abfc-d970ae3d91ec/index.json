  "question": "In context with the recent discussions about the Starlink project, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Starlink project is a satellite constellation.</li>\n<li>Satellite constellations are also known as satellite clusters.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nStarlink is a project of American space company SpaceX. It involves the establishment of a satellite constellation. In November, the constellation had 122 satellites. The objective of the project is to provide global internet coverage though space internet. Unlike conventional technologies like fibre optics, space internet can reach even the remotest areas.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nSatellite constellation is not the same as satellite clusters. Satellite clusters involve a group of satellites moving close together in almost identical orbits. In constellations, the satellites move in complementary orbits. Satellite clusters are used to perform a function which otherwise requires a large and expensive satellite."
