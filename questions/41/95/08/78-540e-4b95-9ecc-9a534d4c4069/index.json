  "question": "The atmosphere of the Earth primarily get heated due to which of the following?",
  "option1": "Conduction of Heat Energy by Atmosphere",
  "option2": "Convection of Heat Energy",
  "option3": "Radiation from Earth",
  "option4": "Absorption of Solar light",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Radiation from Earth",
  "explanation": "<p class=\\\"Explanation\\\">Radiation is the process by which most energy is transferred through space from the sun to the earth. Radiation is given off by all bodies including earth and human being. The hotter is the body, shorter are the waves. We can simply say that the radiation from Sun comes to earth in the form of smaller waves and earth being cooler body, gives off energy in the form of long-wave. These are then radiated back to the atmosphere. This Long-Wave Radiation from the earthâ€™s surfaces heats the lower layers of the atmosphere. It is evident that the atmosphere is primarily heated from below by radiation from the heated Earth surface."
