  "question": "The Cytotron device has been in news recently. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is a particle accelerator.</li>\n<li>It makes use of radio bursts for its function.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe cytotron is a device designed in treatment of cancer. It is known as ‘rotational field quantum magnetic resonance’. It was in news for its being named ‘breakthrough device’ in cancer treatment by the US Food and Drug Administration. It was invented by Dr. Rajah Vijay Kumar of the Centre for Advanced Research and Development.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe cytotron makes use of fast bursts of radio waves. It is used to make the cancer cells stop diving and cease the spreading. This is through regulation of proteins inside these cells called cancer stem cells. These proteins are called programed cell death protein."
