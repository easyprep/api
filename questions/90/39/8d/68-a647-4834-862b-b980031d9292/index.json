  "option1": 0.05,
  "option2": 0.1,
  "option3": 0.15,
  "option4": 0.2,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 0.1,
  "explanation": "Let the rate of interest be R per cent per annum. \r\n$latex \\\\therefore \\\\frac{400\\\\times 2\\\\times R}{100}+\\\\frac{500\\\\times 4\\\\times R}{100} + \\\\frac{1200\\\\times 6\\\\times R}{100} = 1020&s=1$\r\n$latex => 8R+22R+72R = 1020$\r\n$latex => 102R = 1020$\r\n$latex => R = \\\\frac{1020}{102} = 10\\\\%&s=1$\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer."
