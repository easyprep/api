  "explanation": "The World Day for Safety and Health at Work is an annual international campaign to promote safe, healthy and decent work. It is held on 28 April and has been observed by the International Labour Organization (ILO) since 2003. As per estimate, every day 6300 people die at a result of occupational accidents or work related diseases which mean that there are more than 2.3 million deaths per year.  The human cost of this daily adversity is vast and the economic burden of poor occupational safety and health practices is estimated at 4% of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) each year. The 2017 theme \\\"Optimize the collection and use of occupational Safety and Health (OSH)‚Äù focuses on the critical need for countries to improve their capacity to collect and utilize reliable Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) data."
