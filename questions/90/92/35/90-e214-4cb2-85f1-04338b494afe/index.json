  "explanation": "The major difference between Arctic Tundra and Antarctic Tundra is that Antarctic Tundra lacks a large mammal fauna, while in Arctic Tundra we find an array of mammals as mentioned above. The reason is that Antarctica is physically isolated from other continents. However, the shores are inhabited by Sea mammals and sea birds, including seals and penguins. Further, some small mammals, like rabbits and cats, have been introduced by humans to some of the subantarctic islands."
