  "explanation": "The Union Environment Ministry has constituted a committee to implement the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), which aims to reduce particulate matter (PM) pollution by 20%-30% in at least 102 cities by 2024. The committee will be chaired by the Secretary, Union Environment Ministry. The NCAP is envisioned as a five-year action plan with 2019 as the first year. There would be a review every five years. The purpose of the committee is to ensure inter-ministerial organisation and cooperation, share information and resolve issues that could arise between ministries. The NCAP requires cities to implement specific measures such as ensuring roads are pothole-free to improve traffic flow and thereby reduce dust (within 60 days) or ensuring strict action against unauthorised brick kilns (within 30 days)."
