  "answer": "Virus",
  "explanation": "Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious animal disease. It is one of the most serious livestock diseases. It affects cloven-hoofed animals, including cattle, buffalo, camels, sheep, goats, deer and pigs. <br />FMD is a viral disease that spreads rapidly between animals. Virus is excreted in breath, saliva, mucus, milk and faeces. The virus can be excreted by animals for up to four days before clinical signs appear.<br />Although FMD is not very lethal in adult animals, it can kill young animals and cause serious production losses. The clinical signs are fever followed by the appearance of vesicles between the toes and on the heels, on mammary glands and especially on the lips, tongue and palate. These vesicles often combine to form large, swollen blisters that erupt to leave raw, painful ulcers that take up to 10 days to heal."
