  "option1": "3 and 4",
  "option2": "1, 2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 and 4",
  "option4": "2 only",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nGII is an annual report of countries ranked according to their innovations. It is published by WIPO/ World Intellectual Property Organisation, along with other partners like WB. WIPO is one of the 15 specialised agencies of the UN. Its function is to protect intellectual property and also to encourage innovative activities.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nIndia has shown the best performance in the “knowledge and technology output” section of GII by jumping 11 spots from its previous standing. GII has seven pillars, out of which India improved in 4. India stands at the 32<sup>nd</sup> with respect to knowledge and technology outputs. Other areas where improvement was observed are human capital and research, institution and also market sophistication.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nIndia holds the top spot for service exports. India has historically performed well in this field, given its huge human capital. India became a global player in service sector especially after the 1991 economic reforms. RBI had noted that Indian service exports had grown by 6.6% in March.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is incorrect:\nSwitzerland holds the top spot in GII. Switzerland has held the spot for every year since 2011. The key factors for the country’s success are well functioning IP rights and rules, manufacturing, investments in R&amp;D and also quality universities. Israel is a new entrant to the top 10 countries list this year."
