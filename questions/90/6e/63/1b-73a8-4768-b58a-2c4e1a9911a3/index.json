  "question": "As per which UNSC committee, JeM chief Masood Azhar has been designated as global terrorist?",
  "option1": "UNSC 1267 Committee",
  "option2": "UNSC 1265 Committee",
  "option3": "UNSC 1266 Committee",
  "option4": "UNSC 1268 Committee",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "UNSC 1267 Committee",
  "explanation": "In a major diplomatic victory for India, Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar was listed as a designated terrorist by the UN Security Council 1267 Committee on 1st May 2019 after China lifted its block on the move. The move will lead to sanctions on Azhar’s travel and his ability to secure finance for his group. Significantly, the reasons for listing did not mention the Pulwama attack of February 14, for which the JeM had claimed responsibility. The reasons for designating Azhar as a terrorist as per latest listing included his support for the JeM since its founding, being associated with the Al-Qaeda by recruiting for them and “participating in the financing, planning, facilitating, preparing, or perpetrating of acts or activities or supplying, selling or transferring arms and related material”. It also pointed to his role in recruiting fighters in Afghanistan. The JeM itself was sanctioned by the 1267 Committee in 2001. A UNSC designation will subject Azhar to an assets freeze, travel ban and an arms embargo. An assets freeze under the sanctions committee requires that all states freeze without delay the funds and other financial assets or economic resources of designated individuals and entities."
