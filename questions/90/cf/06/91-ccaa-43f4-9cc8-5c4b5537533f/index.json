  "explanation": "Recently, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and International Air Transport Association (IATA) have launched ‘SkyRev360’ system that will offer comprehensive e-billing solution to data gathering, invoicing and collection providing additional revenue to AAI.  This unique system is one of its kind and would help airport operators world- wide in avoiding revenue leakages, reducing redundancies, reduction in disputes, easy integration with all external systems and also help in curtailing the debt collection period to the minimum. The purpose of this system is to generate more and better business opportunities and to maximize and enhance non-aeronautical revenues. The IATA is a trade association of the world’s airlines. It is headquartered at Montreal, Canada with Executive Offices in Geneva, Switzerland."
