  "question": "Which of the following is correct about transverse mechanical waves?",
  "option1": "they can travel through solids and gases",
  "option2": "they can travel through solids but not liquids",
  "option3": "they can travel through solids and liquids",
  "option4": "they can travel through gases but not solids",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "they can travel through solids but not liquids",
  "explanation": "In transverse waves, the constituents of the medium oscillate perpendicular to wave motion subjecting each element of the medium to shearing stress. Solids and strings have shear modulus, that is they sustain shearing stress. Fluids have no shape of their own - they yield to shearing stress. This is why transverse waves are possible in solids and strings (under tension) but not in fluids."
