  "question": "Which of the following statements is true?",
  "option1": "Both salinity and density of sea increase with depth",
  "option2": "Both salinity and density of sea decrease with depth",
  "option3": "Salinity increases but density of sea decreases with depth",
  "option4": "Salinity decreases but density of sea increases with depth",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both salinity and density of sea increase with depth",
  "explanation": "Salinity increases slightly with increasing depth. The density of sea increases with depth. The water molecules pack together tighter as pressure increases -the pressure increase with depth, due to the weight of the water above, and causes the greatest density changes in seawater with depth."
