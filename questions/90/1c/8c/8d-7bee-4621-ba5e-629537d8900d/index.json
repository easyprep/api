The committee will suggest measures that can be undertaken to ensure safety of women working in the IT sector. This information was given by the state government to Bombay High Court. The government also sought four weeks\\' time to file a detailed affidavit on long-term steps it was contemplating to enhance women\\'s safety. The court has taken up the PIL ‘suo motu’ (on its own) on the issue of women\\'s safety in the state. In January 2017, a woman software engineer working with Infosys was allegedly killed by a security guard on the company\\'s premises in Pune."
