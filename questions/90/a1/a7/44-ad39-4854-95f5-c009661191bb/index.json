  "question": "Nobel laureate Sydney Brenner, who passed away recently, was from which country?",
  "option1": "United Kingdom",
  "option2": "France",
  "option3": "United States",
  "option4": "South Africa",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "South Africa",
  "explanation": "Sydney Brenner (92), a South African-born biologist, has passed away in Singapore on April 5, 2019. He helped decipher the genetic code and his research on a roundworm sparked a new field of human disease research. Brenner shared the Nobel Prize in medicine in 2002 for his contribution to work unraveling how genes control cell division. He and two colleagues, John Sulston and Robert Horvitz, traced a transparent roundworm known as C. elegans to determine how cells divide and create something new. The findings on programmed cell death were key to understanding how cancers develop and laid the groundwork for making C. elegans a major model organism in research."
