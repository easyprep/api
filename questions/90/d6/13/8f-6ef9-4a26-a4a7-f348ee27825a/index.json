He was assisted to end his life by Exit International, a right-to-die organization. David Goodall was not terminally ill but his health had deteriorated in the recent past and he chose to end his life because he felt that his quality of life had deteriorated in the past 5 to 10 years. He was a botanist and ecologist. As Euthanasia and assisted dying are banned in Australia, he chose Switzerland to end his life.",
