  "answer": "Maharashtra",
  "explanation": "The Thai Mangur fish, which has a similar appearance like fresh water Mangur, is cultivated in highly unhygienic conditions in the state and it causes sickness to people on consumption.\r\nHence, the Maharashtra government has launched a special drive to destroy the cultivation centres of the exotic Thai Mangur fish. The Head of the state fisheries department has ordered a ban on sale of the fish. The National Green Tribunal had earlier banned the sale of the fish species in 2000."
