  "question": "Who gave the Competing Migrants Model of Migration?",
  "option1": "Lee",
  "option2": "Pryor",
  "option3": "Ravenstein",
  "option4": "Stouffer",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Stouffer",
  "explanation": "In 1960, Stouffer further modified his theory of intervening opportunities and added a concept of competing migrants. According to the new model during a given time interval, the number of migrants from city 1 to city 2 is the direct function of the number of opportunities in city 2 and an inverse function of the number of opportunities intervening between city 1 and city 2, and also the number of other migrants for the opportunities in city 2."
