  "answer": "Jalore district",
  "explanation": "Ganga Kumari, the resident of Raniwara in Jalore district of Rajasthan, has become the first transgender to be appointed in Rajasthan Police. On 13th November 2017, the Rajasthan High Court had directed the police department to appoint Ganga Kumari as a constable within six weeks, after officials denied her a post due to her gender and reported lack of clarity of rules in 2015. She was selected in the police recruitment examination for constables in 2013. However, her appointment was held up following the medical examination, which brought to the recruitersâ€™ notice that she was a eunuch."
