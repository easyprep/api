  "question": "In which year, Civil Disobedience Movement was finally withdrawn?",
  "option1": 1933,
  "option2": 1934,
  "option3": 1935,
  "option4": 1936,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 1934,
  "explanation": "Lord Willingdon, who had succeeded Lord Irwin as the Viceroy of India in 1931, ignored many of the provisions of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, and went against its spirit. The British became very tough and within a week of launching CDM again, Gandhi and Patel were arrested on 4 January 1932. Soon after all the CWC members were put behind bars. Many Congress organisations were banned, their funds confiscated, and offices seized. Leading Congress-persons were rounded up. Processions were lathi-charged or fired-upon. Freedom fighters found to indulge in even minor violence were severely thrashed, jailed, and flogged. Press censorship was imposed. Ordinances ruled the day. Arrested under a regulation that permitted detention without trial, with no fixed sentence, Gandhi and Patel were lodged at Yerwada jail in Poona. Gandhi was released after about 16 months in the summer of 1933, while Patel was released after over 30 months in July 1934. The movement failed to build a tempo, and was crushed within a few months. Officially, the CDM was suspended in May 1933, but was finally withdrawn in May 1934."
