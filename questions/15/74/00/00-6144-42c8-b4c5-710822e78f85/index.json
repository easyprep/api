  "explanation": "President Vladimir Putin has recently signed a decree to withdraw Russia&rsquo;s signature from the International Criminal Court treaty. Russia in 2000 signed the Rome treaty that established the Hague-based court but never ratified it. International Criminal Court is based in Hague, Netherlands, and is an intergovernmental organization and international tribunal. Currently, there are 124 states which are party to Rome Statute and therefore members of the ICC. Both India and China are not its members."
