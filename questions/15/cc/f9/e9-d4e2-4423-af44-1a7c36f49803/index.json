  "question": "Consider the following statements: <br />1. Light of longer wavelength is scattered much more than the light of shorter wavelength.<br />2. The speed of visible light in water is 0.95 times and speed in vacuum.<br />3. Radio waves are produced by rapidly oscillating electrical currents.<br />4. To detect the over speeding vehicles, police use the Doppler effect of reflected short radio waves<br />Which of these statements are correct?",
  "option1": "1 and 2",
  "option2": "1 and 3",
  "option3": "2 and 4",
  "option4": "3 and 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "3 and 4",
  "explanation": "Radio waves are generated by electric charges undergoing acceleration, such as time varying electric currents. Naturally occurring radio waves are emitted by lightning and astronomical objects. Radio waves are generated artificially by transmitters and received by radio receivers, using antennas.<br />Radar speed detectors bounce microwave radiation off of moving vehicles and detect the reflected waves. These waves are shifted in frequency by the Doppler effect, and the beat frequency between the directed and reflected waves provides a measure of the vehicle speed."
