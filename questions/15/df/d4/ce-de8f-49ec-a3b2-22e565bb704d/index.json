The village is roughly 8 km away from the hill station of Panchgani. As of now, all the books provided by the Maharashtra government are in Marathi. Soon, the books written in Hindi and English will be added to this collection. Author interactions, literary events and book-reading sessions will also be conducted in the village. The idea for this book village is inspired by Hay-on-Wye, a Welsh town known for its book stores and literature festivals."
