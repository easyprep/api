  "question": "Consider the following statements: <ol> <li>While PM (particulate matter) and Nitrous oxides (NOx) are more prevalent in a diesel engine, Hydrocarbons and Carbon monoxide are more prevalent in petrol engines.</li> <li>While use of catalytic convertor in an engine reduces emission of carbon monoxide and nitrous oxides, but it increases the emission of carbon dioxide</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Both are correct statements<br> Carbon Monoxide and Hydrocarbons emission is more prevalent in Petrol engines whereas particulate matters and nitrous oxides emission is more prevalent in diesel engine. Use of catalytic convertor in an engine reduces the emission of nitrous oxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide; on the other hand it increases the emission of carbon dioxide."
