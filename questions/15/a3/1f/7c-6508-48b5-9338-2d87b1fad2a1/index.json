  "option2": "5.0 %",
  "option3": "4.8 %",

  "answer": "4.8 %",
  "explanation": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) decreased India’s GDP growth forecast to 4.8 per cent for this fiscal year, which is 1.3 percentage point lesser than its previous estimates.\r\nThe IMF also projected that India’s economy will grow by 5.8 per cent next year and 6.5 per cent in 2021-2022. The Global economic growth rate was also lowered by the IMF to be 3.3 % in the current year and 3.4 % in 2022. India’s GDP forecast dip was mainly due to the NBFC crisis and weak demand in rural India. The slowdown in India is said to be the reason for cut in global growth rate."
