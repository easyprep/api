  "question": "A motorboat in still water traveles at a speed of 36 kmph. It goes 56 km upstream in 1 hour 45 minutes. The time taken by it to cover the same distance down the stream will be :",
  "option1": "2 Hours 21 Minutes",
  "option2": "1 Hours 24 Minutes",
  "option3": "1 Hours 25 Minutes",
  "option4": "3 Hours",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Hours 24 Minutes",
  "explanation": "Speed of the motorboat upstream = \r\n$latex \\\\frac{56 km}{1\\\\frac{3}{4}hours} = \\\\frac{56\\\\times 4}{7} = 32 kmph&s=2$\r\nLet the speed of the current be x kmph \r\n∴ 36 - x = 32\r\n$latex => x  = 36 - 32 = 4 kmph$\r\nSpeed of motor boat downstream = 36 + 4 = 40 kmph\r\n∴ Time taken to cover 56 km at 40 kmph = $latex \\\\frac{56}{40} = \\\\frac{7}{5}hours&s=1$\r\nor 1 hours 24 minutes.\r\nHence option [B] is the right answer."
