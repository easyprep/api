  "question": "Which among the following is the property of Tungsten which makes it eligible to use in the bulbs?",
  "option1": "highest melting point",
  "option2": "highest resistance",
  "option3": "Highest malleability",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "highest melting point",
  "explanation": "The electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electric bulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is possible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such high temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as tungsten (melting point 3380Â°C) is used for making bulb filaments. The filament should be thermally isolated as much as possible, using insulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually filled with chemically inactive nitrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament. Most of the power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part of it is in the form of light radiated."
