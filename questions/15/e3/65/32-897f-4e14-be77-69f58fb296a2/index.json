  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "The first statement is correct because the many of the republics and oligarchies that were prevalent in the pre-Mauryan India had collapsed with the rise of Mauryas. The second statement is not correct. Though Kautilya supported monarchy but he never stood for royal absolutism. He writes that the King should take advice of his ministry (Mantriparishada) in running the administration."
