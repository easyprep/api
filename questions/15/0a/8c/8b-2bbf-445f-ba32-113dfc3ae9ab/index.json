  "answer": "World Bank",
  "explanation": "Pandemic Bonds were launched by World Bank under its Pandemic Emergency Financing umbrella in 2017 in response to the 2013 to 2016 Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. However, their efficacy has always been under fire. The bonds issued by the World Bank's International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), offer investors high coupons in return for the risk of having to forgo some or all their money in the event of pandemic outbreaks of a number of infectious diseases."
