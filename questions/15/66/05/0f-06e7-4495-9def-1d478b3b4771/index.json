  "question": "Consider the following comparisons of Glaucoma and Cataract:<br> 1.While Glaucoma is caused by damage to optic nerve, Cataract is caused by opacity of the lens<br> 2.While vision lost in Glaucoma cannot be retrieved, it can be retrieved in case of Cataract Which among the above is / are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "It is often referred to as a silent eye disease, Glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness in the world. It is an eye disease that causes progressive damage to the optic nerve at the point where it leaves the eye to deliver information to the brain. On the other hand, Cataract is clouding of the lens inside the eye which leads to a decrease in vision. Cataract is the leading cause for blindness. While loss of vision caused by cataract can be retrieved, vision loss due to glaucoma cannot be regained by therapeutic intervention. Both cataracts and glaucoma can be a natural part of the aging process. Many people over 60 may have both. The two diseases are not associated to each other in any other way than aging. Besides old age, several risk factors cause Glaucoma such as family history, ethnic background, high intra-ocular pressure and high blood pressure. Long-term usage of steroids could also cause the disease. Ocular hypertension (increased pressure within the eye) is the most important risk factor in most glaucoma."
