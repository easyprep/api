  "answer": "Sharad Singh Negi",
  "explanation": "The Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) is a statutory advisory body under the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF) and its headquarters is located at Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The AWBI is in news because the organization will now be permanently chaired by a senior MoEF official. Thus, Dr. Sharad Singh Negi, who is the Director General of Forests & Special Secretary (MoEF), has been appointed the chairman of the newly created 18-member Board of AWBI for 3 years. The AWBI derives its legal structure from the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 and frames a range of rules on how animals ought to be humanely treated everywhere. It has also frequently litigated to have stricter laws to ensure animals were not unduly harassed or tortured."
