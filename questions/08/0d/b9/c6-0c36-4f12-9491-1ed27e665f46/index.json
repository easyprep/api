  "question": "A boat filled with some stones is floating in water. If the stones are dropped into the water what will happen to the level of the water?",
  "option1": "Rise",
  "option2": "Decrease",
  "option3": "Remain the same",
  "option4": "Insufficient data to predict",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Decrease",
  "explanation": "If something is floating in water, it will displace an amount of water equal to its weight. Therefore, if you have anything denser than water (stones) floating in a boat and you throw it into the water, the water level will go down because the object displaces less water when submerged."
