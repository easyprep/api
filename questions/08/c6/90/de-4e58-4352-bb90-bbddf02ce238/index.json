  "question": "The Super-heavy elements:<br> 1. are generally not stable<br> 2. are not found in nature Which among the above is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The scientists recently confirmed existence of element 117- â€œUnunseptium (Uus), which is 40% heavier than an atom of lead. This is one of the super heavy elements. Elements with atomic number greater than 104 are referred to as Super-Heavy Elements. Although super-heavy elements have not been found in nature, they can be created by accelerating beams of nuclei and shooting them at the heaviest possible target nuclei."
