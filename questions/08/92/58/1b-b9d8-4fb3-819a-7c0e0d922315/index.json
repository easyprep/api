Under the leadership of Patel, the Bardoli peasants decided to refuse payments of the revised assessment until the Government appointed an independent tribunal or accepted the current amount as full payment. Those who opposed the movement had to faced a social boycott. The outcome of the satyagraha was British Government setup Maxwell-Broomfield commission, reduced land Revenue to 6.03% and returned confiscated land back to farmers. In this struggle, Vallabhbhai Patel got the title of “Sardar” by local farmers of Bardoli."
