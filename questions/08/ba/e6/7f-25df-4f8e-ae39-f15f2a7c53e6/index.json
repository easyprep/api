  "question": "Consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The office of the Central Vigilance Commissioner in India has a Constitutional Status</li>\r\n<li>CVC can be removed by the president of India only on recommendation by the Council of Ministers.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "Statement 1 is incorrect . It is NOT a constitutional office. The Central Vigilance Commission Act 2003 established this commission in September 2003. CVC is the `Designated Statutory Agency` to receive written complaints for disclosure on any allegation of corruption or misuse of office and recommend appropriate action.\r\nStatement 2 is also incorrect . Section 6 (1) of the CVC act says: Subject to the provisions of sub-section (3), the Central Vigilance Commissioner or any Vigilance Commissioner shall be removed from his office only by order of the President on the ground of proved misbehavior or incapacity after the Supreme Court, on a reference made to it by the President, has, on inquiry, reported that the Central Vigilance Commissioner or any Vigilance Commissioner, as the case may be, ought on such ground be removed."
