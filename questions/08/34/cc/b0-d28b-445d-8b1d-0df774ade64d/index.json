  "question": "With regards to the recent excavations of 1,500 years old artefact from Nagardhan, Nagpur, consider the following:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The artefacts were from Vakataka period.</li>\n<li>The 1,500 year old seal bears Devanagari script.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe recent excavations in Nagardhan in Nagpur are from the Vakataka period. The Vakataka was a dynasty that ruled over central and southern parts of India between 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> centuries. The 1,500 year old seal specifically dates to the period of rule by Queen Prabhavatigupta- also known as the Vakataka-Gupta period.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe 1,500 year old seal uncovered by the archaeological team in Nagardhan is made of clay. This is the first such artefact discovery from the region. It bears brahmi scripts and a depiction of a conch. The discovery is significant because the current understanding about the dynasty is largely from copperplate inscriptions and literature."
