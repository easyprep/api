  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about atmospheric pressure?<br />\n<ol>\n<li>IsohalineÂ are lines connecting places having equal pressure.</li>\n<li>A rising pressure indicates fine, settled weather.</li>\n<li>A falling pressure indicates unstable and cloudy weather.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The force exerted on the surface by the column of air above it is called atmospheric pressure or air pressure. Isobars are lines connecting places having equal pressure. It is measured at any station after being reduced to sea level. A change in either temperature or density will cause a corresponding change in the air pressure. A rising pressure indicates fine, settled weather whereas a falling pressure indicates unstable and cloudy weather."
