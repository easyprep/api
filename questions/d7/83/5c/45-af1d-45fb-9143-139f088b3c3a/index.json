  "explanation": "Chicxulub crater is an impact crater buried underneath Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. It was formed after the large Chicxulub impactor hit the Earth more than 66 million years ago. Space dust in this crater confirmed the role of the impactor in the mass extinction of dinosaurs.<br />The recent study connected the space dust and high concentration of worldwide iridium deposits at the time of dinosaursâ€™ demise to provide this conclusion.",
