  "question": "1000 Rs. is invested at 5% per annum simple interest. If the interest is added to the principal after every 10 years, the amount will become 2000 Rs. after :",
  "option1": "$latex 15\\ years$",
  "option2": "$latex 16\\frac{2}{3}\\ years&s=1$",
  "option3": "$latex 18\\ years$",

  "answer": "$latex 16\\frac{2}{3}\\ years&s=1$",
  "explanation": "$latex \\\\mathbf{16\\\\frac{2}{3}}\\\\ years&s=1$</b><br />\r\nAfter 10 years\r\n$latex SI = \\\\frac{1000\\\\times 5\\\\times 10}{100} = 500\\\\ Rs.&s=1$\r\nPrincipal for 11th year = 1000 + 500 = 1500 Rs. \r\n$latex \\\\therefore T = \\\\frac{SI\\\\times 100}{P\\\\times R} = \\\\frac{500\\\\times 100}{1500\\\\times 5}&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{20}{3}\\\\ years = 6\\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\ years&s=1$\r\nâˆ´ Total time $latex = 10+6\\\\frac{2}{3} = 16\\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\ years&s=1$\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer."
