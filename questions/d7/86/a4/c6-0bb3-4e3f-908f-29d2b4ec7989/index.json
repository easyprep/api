It is one of the world\\'s most isolated regimes where Western services including Twitter and Viber, along with popular Russian networks Odnoklassniki and VKontakte blocked.

Only officially sanctioned media are allowed to operate and internet access is provided solely by the state-owned TurkmenTelecom."
