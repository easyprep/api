  "question": "Which of the following is the reason after the expansion of rice while boiling?",
  "option1": "The starch gelatinises and swells",
  "option2": "The starch gets polymerised",
  "option3": "The grains absorb moisture and swell",
  "option4": "Sugars break down in the grains",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "The grains absorb moisture and swell",
  "explanation": "Starch molecules in a grain of rice are actually arranged in a semi-crystalline state. Starch becomes soluble in water when heated. The granules swell and burst, the semi-crystalline state is lost, and the smaller amylose molecules leach out and form a network that holds water."
