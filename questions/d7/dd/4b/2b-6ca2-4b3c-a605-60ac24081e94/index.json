  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct because Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) Scheme aims to control the price of perishable agri-horticultural commodities. It provides interest free loan to State Governments/Union Territories and Central agencies to manage the resources. Second statement is incorrect because the Price Stabilization Fund is managed centrally by a Price Stabilization Fund Management Committee (PSFMC), which approves all proposals from State Governments and Central Agencies. The PSF is maintained in a Central Corpus Fund account by Small Farmers Agri-Business Consortium (SFAC), which will act as Fund Manager."
