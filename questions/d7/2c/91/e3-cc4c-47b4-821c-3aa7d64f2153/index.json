  "answer": "India",
  "explanation": "India successfully performed the first test its new surface-to-air missile with nozzle less booster powered by Solid Fuel Ducted Ramjet (SFDR) technology, from launching complex-III of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) off Odisha coast. The missile has not been given a formal name yet. It has been indigenously designed and developed by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). The Solid Fuel Ducted Ramjet (SFDR) technology was developed by India in collaboration with Russia. The missile flew in its intended trajectory at a speed of Mach 3 (three times the speed of sound). It performed as expected and perfectly validated the new indigenous technology. All radars, telemetry and electro-optical systems deployed along the coast tracked and monitored the health parameters of the missile system. The data generated during the test are analysed for future missions.",
