  "answer": "Parliament by Law",
  "explanation": "The parliament of India has power to make laws, organizing jurisdiction and powers of supreme court. The number of judges can be increased or decreased by the parliament by legislation. There was a Provision in our constitution originally that there will be a CJ and 7 other judges. This number was raised to 10 in 1956, 13 in 1960, 17 in 1977, 25 in 1985. Later number of judges in the supreme court was raised from 26 (25+1) to 31 (30+1) . Current sanctioned strength of the Supreme Court is thus 31."
