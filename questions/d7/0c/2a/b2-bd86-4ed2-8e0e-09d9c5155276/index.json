Also a special purpose vehicle, named Bhor Sagar Port Limited, has also been floated under the partnership of the Kolkata Port Trust and the West Bengal Government. Another new port, to be developed either in Machilipatnam or Vodarevu, in Andhra Pradesh has also been proposed. These new ports are likely to increase Indiaâ€™s cargo handling capacity by 466 million tonne per year and hence improve the logistics support in India and act as a channel to enhance the Make in India initiative by the government."
