  "question": "Consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Pellagra is caused by deficiency of Vitamin B3 (Niacin)</li>\r\n<li>Dietary content of Sorghum ensures protection against Pellagra</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "Please note that Sorghum contains adequate tryptophan which is necessary for creation of Niacin, But, it also contains high levels of leucine, another amino acid that interferes with the enzymatic conversion of tryptophan to niacin. Thus endemic pellagra has been noted among poor peasants of the Deccan Plateau of India who subsist on a staple diet of sorghum (millet). So statement 2 is incorrect."
