  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Income tax department has introduced an instalment mechanism for businesses and companies- which are the prime tax payers in Mumbai. Under this mechanism, the deserving tax payer can pay the 20% of the demand from the assessing officer in instalments as opposed to the lump payment within a month rule that is currently followed.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe new norms will not waive off any tax liability and does not affect the department’s revenue collection. It only gives a partial tax relief on a case to case basis. The deserving tax payer has till end of March to finish the payment. The move was made in light of the liquidity crisis."
