  "question": "With reference to the Advanced Pricing Agreements entered into by CBDT, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>All these APAs are bilateral.</li>\n<li>The APAs will determine the transfer pricing methodology with respect to international transactions.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",

  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nIn this financial year (till August), India’s CBDT has entered into 26 APAs. Of these only one is bilateral while the rest are unilateral in nature. Unilateral APAs are between the tax payer and his/her country’s tax authority. Bilateral APAs involve foreign tax authority too. This bilateral APA was signed with the UK.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe APAs will determine the transfer pricing of international transactions. Transfer pricing is the value associated with a good that is transferred between two parties in different countries. Some of the goods subject to transfer pricing are raw materials, machinery, etc.\n&nbsp;"
