  "explanation": "1000 Lakes Rally or Rall of the Thousand Lakes or Neste Oil Rally Finland was the former name of Rally Finland, also known as Neste Rally Finland, which is a rally competition in the Finnish Lakeland in Central Finland. The rally is driven on wide and smooth gravel roads, featuring blind crests and big jumps. It is the fastest event in the World Rally Championship and has been dubbed the \"Grand Prix of Rallying\" and the \"Grand Prix on Gravel\". Rally Finland is among the largest annually organised public events in the Nordic countries, attracting hundreds of thousands of spectators each year. The rally has been known to be very difficult for non-Nordic drivers; only seven drivers from countries other than Finland or Sweden have won the event- in the 1980s and before, the field was made up almost entirely of Finnish and Swedish drivers."
