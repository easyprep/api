  "option1": "Treaty of Peshawar",
  "option2": "Treaty of Gandamak",
  "option3": "Treaty of 1857",
  "option4": "Treaty of Lahore",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Treaty of Gandamak",
  "explanation": "The treaty of 1879 was signed May 26 in Gandamak. It provided that Afghanistan be turned into a state dependent on England. Afghanistan lost its right to conduct independent foreign relations. In effect, the British resident in Kabul acquired control over the country’s internal affairs. The Sibi, Kurram, and Pishin areas passed to the English. The conclusion of this treaty aroused indignation in Afghanistan. The anti-imperialist struggle of the popular masses forced England to renounce control over Afghanistan’s internal affairs and withdraw its troops from Kandahar in 1881, which they had occupied in January 1879."
