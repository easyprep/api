  "question": "&nbsp; Consider the following statements about Hoysala architecture: <ol> <li>Hoysala built temples dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu as well as Jain temples</li> <li>Most of the Hoysala temples were Indo-Aryan style&nbsp;of temple&nbsp;architecture</li> </ol> &nbsp;Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "The Hoysalas usually dedicated their temples to&nbsp;Shiva&nbsp;or to&nbsp;Vishnu, but they occasionally built some temples dedicated to the Jain faith as well. Second statement is incorrect because study of the Hoysala architectural style has revealed a negligible&nbsp;Indo-Aryan&nbsp;influence while the impact of&nbsp;Southern Indian&nbsp;style is more distinct."
