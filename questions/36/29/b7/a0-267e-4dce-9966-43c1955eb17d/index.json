  "option1": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "option3": "Only 1, 2 & 4",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "A regressive tax is a tax that takes a larger percentage from low-income people than from high-income people. As the income rises, the tax rate decreases in regressive taxation. So, it will prove to be a hindrance to Start-up India programme. Widening of the tax base will reduce the revenue deficit and hence will help to boost Start-up initiatives."
