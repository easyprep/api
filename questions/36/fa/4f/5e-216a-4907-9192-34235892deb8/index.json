  "question": "With reference to the heightened security around the Sir Creek, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>India recognizes the use of thalweg principle to identify the boundary with Pakistan in this creek.</li>\n<li>The creek divides Punjab from Pakistan.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThalweg principle is used to demarcate boundary lines between the states when a navigable waterway is present. Thalweg is the line with the deepest depression in a waterway- formed by joining lowest points along the water body’s stretch. While India recognizes its use to demarcate its boundary, Pakistan is disputing its use given the tidal nature of the creek.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe creek separates India’s Gujarat from Pakistan’s Sindh province. It is about 96km long and has a tendency to shift with time. This nature of the creek has kept the issue of demarcation pending for over 7 decades. The region is the site of numerous disputes like arrests of fishermen.\n&nbsp;"
