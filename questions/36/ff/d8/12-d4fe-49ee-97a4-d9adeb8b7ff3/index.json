  "question": "By how many times are the Electrostatic forces stronger than the Gravitational Forces for a fixed distance?",
  "option1": "10<sup>2</sup>",
  "option2": "10<sup>36</sup>",
  "option3": "10<sup>12</sup>",
  "option4": 2,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "10<sup>36</sup>",
  "explanation": "Electrostatic forces are 10<sup>36</sup> times stronger than the Gravitational Forces for a fixed distance. Electrostatic forces may be attractive or repulsive depending upon the charges. Electrostatic forces are conservative forces and obey inverse square law."
