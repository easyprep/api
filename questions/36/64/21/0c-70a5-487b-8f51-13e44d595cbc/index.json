  "explanation": "The first-ever global coalition on clean and efficient cooling was launched at the First Global Conference on Synergies between the 2030 Agenda and Paris Agreement, which concluded on April 3, 2019, in Copenhagen, Denmark.  The aim of Cool Coalition is to inspire ambition, identify solutions and mobilise action to accelerate progress towards clean and efficient cooling.  It is a global effort led by UN Environment, the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, the Kigali Cooling Efficiency Program, and Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL). It also includes government officials from Chile, Rwanda, Denmark as well as leaders from civil society, research and academia. As the world gets warmer, the demand for air conditioners is projected to grow and the greenhouse gas it emits will endanger the planet. Thus, the United Nations-backed ‘Cool Coalition’ comprising 23 members stated that clean, efficient cooling appliances and equipment can save up to $2.9 trillion in energy use by 2050, and help avoid 0.4° Celsius warming of the planet.  The Global Cool Coalition is a unified front that links action across the Kigali Amendment, Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."
