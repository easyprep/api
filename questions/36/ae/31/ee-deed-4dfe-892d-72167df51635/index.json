  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe ‘elephant walk’ exercise was conducted by the US Air Force in light of the recent tensions between Iran and USA. It is a close formation taxiing of fighter jets, in this case F-35A aircrafts. The exercise was so named for its resemblance to elephants’ movement near watering holes.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct: </strong>\r\nThe elephant walk is used for minimum interval takeoff of fighter jets. The aircrafts move in a nose to tail manner and takeoff in quick succession. It is used to exhibit teamwork capacity of squadrons. It is especially used to prepare the force for a fully armed wartime operation launch."
