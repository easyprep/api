  "question": "Which of the following functions is performed by a Black hole?",
  "option1": "It does not emit any radiations",
  "option2": "It converts UV/radiations to infra-rec1 radiations",
  "option3": "It absorbs all the radiations that fall on it",
  "option4": "It is an imaginary concept in Physics",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "It absorbs all the radiations that fall on it",
  "explanation": "A <em>black hole</em> is a region of spacetime exhibiting gravitational acceleration so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a <em>black hole</em>."
