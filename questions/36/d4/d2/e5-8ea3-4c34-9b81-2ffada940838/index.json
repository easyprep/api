  "explanation": "Guinea houses the \"Fouta Djallon\" highland region. Fouta Djallon is a highland region in the centre of Guinea, roughly corresponding with Middle Guinea, in West Africa. Fouta-Djallon consists mainly of rolling grasslands, at an average elevation of about 900 m. The highest point, Mount Loura, rises to 1,515 m. The plateau consists of thick sandstone formations that overlie granitic basement rock. Erosion by rain and rivers has carved deep jungle canyons and valleys into the sandstone.",
