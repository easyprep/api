  "explanation": "Cotton grows in tropical and sub-tropical warm humid climate. Annual temperature requirement is 20°-28°C. Equitable temperature distribution and bright sunshine is desirable. (ii) Rainfall: Annual rainfall of 550-1000 cm is ideal for cotton Cultivation.<br />Flax is a crop of the temperate zone and long day plant. Flax requires a cool humid climate temperature ranging from 100C to 270C, rainfall ranging from 500-800 mm with high humidity (60-65%) during growing season. Fibre type generally require cool, moist climate, somewhat cloudy weather during growing season.<br />Tropical sugar beet requires good sunshine during its growth period. Sugar beet can be grown during October to March with a well distributed rainfall of 500 – 600 mm across the growing period. This condition favours vegetative growth and acts as a base for tuber enlargement."
