  "question": "&nbsp;\nRajasthan launched its new higher education model. Consider the following statements about the program:\n<ol>\n<li>The Resource Allocation for Colleges with Excellence will aid meritorious colleges.</li>\n<li>The beneficiary colleges will receive assistance from a resource pool to be created by the government.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?",
  "option1": "1 and 2",
  "option2": "None of the above",
  "option3": "1 only",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Resource Allocation for Colleges with Excellence program seeks to address the resource shortage faced by the state’s higher education sector. Under this program, the college in need sends application for availing the benefits. All the colleges in the state would be given equal opportunity to benefit from the scheme. This would especially help the remote and rural institutions. \n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe colleges in need are to send application to a nodal college, determined by the government. This college would send the necessary resources to these institutions. Each district would get a nodal college. The resources deputed will include teachers, technicians and also facilities like equipment, projectors, digital library, etc."
