  "question": "Consider the following statements about the Vijayanagara Empire: <ol> <li>The king was the highest court of appeal in the Vijayanagara Empire</li> <li>Village was the basic unit of administration</li> <li>Caste system was absent and all human beings were treated equally in the matters of employment</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "3 Only",
  "option3": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 & 2 Only",
  "explanation": "The king was the highest court of appeal in the Vijayanagara Empire, but since he could not afford to hear all the cases, there was an officer called Dandanyaka who heard important cases. Pradhani was overall in charge of administration of justice and may be called the chief justice. Dharmasutras generally formed the basis on which cases were decided. The local governments operated autonomously during the Vijayanagara Empire and village was the basic unit of administration which was headed by Gauda. Third statement is incorrect because Caste system prevailed during the Vijayanagara Empire and while Brahmins followed the traditional profession of teachers and priests, Vaishyas were generally merchants. While the Sudras were mainly involved in agricultural and other works, Kshatriya Varna seems to be absent during the empire."
