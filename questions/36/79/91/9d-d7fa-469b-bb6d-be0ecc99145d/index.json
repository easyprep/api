  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about latitudinal heat balance?<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The amount of insolation received varies from latitude to latitude.</li>\n<li>Regions within the equator and 40째 N and S latitudes are energy deficit regions</li>\n<li>Regions beyond 40째 N and S latitudes are energy surplus regions</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 1",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "The amount of insolation received varies from latitude to latitude. The Regions within the equator and 40째 N and S latitudes are energy surplus regions because they receive abundant sunlight and hence more heat will be gained than lost.<br />The Regions beyond 40째 N and S latitudes are energy deficit regions because they lose more heat than that gained from sunlight."
