  "question": "Consider the following statements about Aquaculture in India: <ol> <li>The ratio of marine fisheries to aquaculture farming is very low in comparison to international ratio</li> <li>Closed-system aquaculture farming is very high</li> <li>Sea Cage Farming is high in India</li> <li>Freshwater aquaculture is high in Eastern India than in Western India</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "1, 2 & 4 Only",
  "option3": "2, 3 & 4 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct. Second statement is incorrect because Closed-system aquaculture or Recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) is very new to India and is practised at very few places. The RAS allows the water inside the fish tank to get filtered and reused multiple times. Recently, to boost the seed production of commercially important marine fish, the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) has set up a Recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) at its Vizhinjam Research Centre. Fourth statement is incorrect because Freshwater aquaculture in Eastern India mainly consists of ponds and tanks of less than 1 ha, while in Western India aquaculture is operated on a larger scale, with watersheds of 15- 25 ha. Third statement is again incorrect because Sea Cage Aquaculture is again new to India and is practised at very few places. Sea Cage aquaculture is the farming of fish by enclosing them in cages or pens. These pens are connected in natural ways like from estuaries, bays or other coastal marine environments. Sea cage farming is one of most modern and efficient methods of farming and it removes one of the biggest constraints of fish farming on landâ€“ the need for a constant flow of clean, oxygenated water."
