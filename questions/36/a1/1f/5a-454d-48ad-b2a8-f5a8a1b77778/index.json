  "question": "The UNCTAD report highlighted excess speculative activities of the private sector as a driver of global debt. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>In speculative trade, currency is bought to sell it at an appreciated rate rather than to buy imports/ finance investments.</li>\n<li>The report recommends wage-led growth instead of finance-led growth.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nSpeculative trades are transactions involving substantial risk and gains. Price fluctuation is a major factor in these trades. In currency speculation (a type of speculative trade), foreign currency is bought to sell it at a later date at an appreciated rate.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe UNCTAD report said that private sector is engaged in speculative excess leading to financial instability. The report says that only one of the 2 is possible with the current scenario: 11.9% growth or steep rise in debt-to-GDP ratio if the SDGs are to be achieved. The report recommends wage-led growth rather than finance-led growth.\n&nbsp;"
