  "answer": "Jordan",
  "explanation": "Jordan has recently launched its first  Underwater Military Museum on the bed of Red Sea off the coast of Aqaba. The dive Site includes several tanks, an ambulance, a military crane, a troop carrier, an anti-aircraft battery, guns and a combat helicopter.  The kingdom is hoping the 19 decommissioned pieces of military hardware, submerged at depths up to 28 metres (92 feet), will attract tourists to the already popular diving resort of Aqaba. The aim of the museum is to offer a new and unique museum experience where adventure-loving tourists can experience the interaction between sports, the environment and the display pieces. Coral reefs in the northern Red Sea are a popular destination for divers and other tourists  due to its good health despite global reef depletion due to global warming."
