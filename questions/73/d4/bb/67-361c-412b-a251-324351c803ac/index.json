  "question": "Consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>About 40 per cent of the Indian soils are deficient in sulphur</li>\r\n<li>The single super phosphate (SSP) fertilizer has sulphur in it</li>\r\n<li>Nutrient Based Subsidy scheme benefits the manufacturers of fertilizers like single super phosphate (SSP)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is/ are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "1 & 2",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "All the statements in this question are correct and explain one aspect of moving from old regime to new regime. Under the old system, the manufacturers of fertilizers like single super phosphate (SSP), which also has sulphur in it, were at a disadvantage because they were not compensated for the sulphur content in their product. About 40 per cent of the Indian soils are deficient in sulphur and need addition of this micronutrient for optimum crop yield. The old system encouraged excessive use of nitrogenous fertilisers, notably urea, and reduced application of phosphatic and potassic fertilisers. This has resulted in imbalance in the use of N, P and K, resulting in lower soil fertility. With nutrient-based subsidy, the farmers will go in for the use of all nutrients according to the requirement of the soil and the crop."
