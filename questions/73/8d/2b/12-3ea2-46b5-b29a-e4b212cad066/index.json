The Bill allows for a person to be declared as a fugitive economic offender (FEO) if: (I) An arrest warrant has been issued against him for any specified offences where the value involved is over Rs 100 crore. (II) He has left the country and refuses to return to face prosecution.<br />Statement 2 is correct: Major provisions of the act are as follows:<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To declare a person an FEO, an application will be filed in a Special Court (designated under the Prevention of Money-Laundering Act, 2002)</li>\r\n<li>The Bill allows authorities to provisionally attach properties of an accused, while the application is pending before the Special Court.</li>\r\n<li>Properties of a person may be confiscated and vested in the central government without warrant, free of encumbrances (rights and claims in the property).</li>\r\n<li>The FEO or any company associated with him may be barred from filing or defending civil claims.Â </li>\r\n</ul>\r\nStatement 3 is incorrect: Under the act, only officers of the rank of Assistant Directors or above in the Enforcement Directorate could exercise power to search and seize record/property. While special Directors of Enforcement of ED\\'s regional offices will function as administrator of confiscated properties."
