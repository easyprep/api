  "question": "&nbsp; &nbsp;Consider the following differences between drip irrigation and surface irrigation: <ol> <li>Drip irrigation is more water-efficient than surface irrigation&nbsp;for vegetable planting</li> <li>While surface irrigation is more suited to sandy soil, drip irrigation is suited to loamy soil</li> </ol> &nbsp; Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct. Vegetables require more water and are grown at higher quantities than field crops, thus, forcing farmers to adopt drip irrigation methods for vegetable planting. Second statement is incorrect because sandy soils have a low water storage capacity and a high infiltration rate; therefore, require small irrigation applications (drip irrigation) but frequent waters, whereas, loamy soil is with low infiltration rates and is best suited for surface irrigation.&nbsp;"
