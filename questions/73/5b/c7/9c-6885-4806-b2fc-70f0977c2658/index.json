  "answer": "1 and 2",
  "explanation": "Features of Hindu influences on Tughlaq architecture include the flat lintel instead of pointed arch, pillars, windows with balconies and eaves and railings. Tughlaqs built three main types of tombs: square, octagonal and pavilion. It was constructed by Ghiyas-ud-din Tughlaq.<br />A notable feature of the tomb is the sloping walls, at a 75 degree angle with the ground instead of vertical walls. This architectural style is similar to the sloping walls of the Hindola Mahal in Mandu, Madhya Pradesh. It is so called because of the distinctive sloping walls which give an impression that the palace is swaying from side to side. Perhaps the wall design was intended to buttress the heavy stone arches that support the ceiling. The inside walls are vertical and plain."
