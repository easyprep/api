  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nFolic acid is an essential vitamin. It cannot be synthesised by the human body. Hence, it’s is sourced from food such as green leafy vegetables. It is used to treat anaemia that’s caused by its deficiency. Its deficiency in pregnant women causes a birth-defect called the Neural Tube Defect.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe National Iron Plus initiative of the Indian government, launched in 2013. This is an initiative of the health and family welfare ministry. It targets several age groups apart from pregnant women- such as children in the 5 to 10 years age group.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nWHO lists iron and folic acid tablet as one of the essential medicines. This is listed under the anti-anaemia medicine category. Other medicines in the category include ferrous salts, folic acid and hydroxocobalamin. Because of the tablets side-effects like stomach disorders, the Assam government is using gooseberry based candies to meet the nutrient requirement.\n&nbsp;"
