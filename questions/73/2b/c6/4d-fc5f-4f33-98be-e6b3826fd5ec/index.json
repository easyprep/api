  "answer": "Second",
  "explanation": "In the Second Anglo-Mysore war (1780-84), the British troops led by Warren Hastings seized the French port Mahe, a port <br />which was very useful to Hyder Ali (the ruler of Mysore) for the entry of supplies. Then, due to this contention, Haider Ali led a joint front with Nizam of Hyderabad and Marathas and captured Arcot. But, due to arrival of Sir Eyre Coote, Haider Ali was defeated in the battles of Porto Novo, Palur and Sholingur. During the war, he died but his son Tipu Sultan continued the struggle. Mean while, French came to his assistance and finally the Treaty of Manglore (1784) was signed. As per the treaty, both sides agreed to return the conquered territories of each other."
