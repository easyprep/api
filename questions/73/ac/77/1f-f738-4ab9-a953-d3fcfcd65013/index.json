  "option2": "Mathura sculptures",
  "option3": "Bharhut sculptures",

  "answer": "Bharhut sculptures",
  "explanation": "Bharhut sculpture is an early Indian sculpture of the Shunga period that decorated the great stupa, or relic mound, of Bharhut, in Madhya Pradesh state. Sculptures similar to the Bharhut remains are located throughout northern India. The flat planes, rather stiffly posed figures and precise, elegant detailing of the ornamentation suggest continuance in stone of an earlier tradition in wood. Green Schist is used as the medium for this sculpture."
