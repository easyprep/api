  "answer": "United States",
  "explanation": "The United States has pulled out from the UN Global Compact on Migration as it does not meet the policies and principles of the Donald Trump administration. The US has been a part of the non-binding New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants since it was unanimously adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2016. The declaration called for negotiations on a Global Compact for Migration, aimed at protecting the rights of refugees and migrants and helping them resettle. It also seeks to fight xenophobia, racism and discrimination towards refugees and migrants. Under Trump and his \\\"America First\\\" policies, the United States has withdrawn from several global commitments made under the administration of President Barack Obama, including the Paris climate deal. The US has also withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and UNESCO, the UN organisation which aims to improve education and preserve cultural heritage worldwide."
