  "question": "Which among the following rivers in India represent superimposed drainage pattern?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Narmada</li>\r\n<li>Mahanadi</li>\r\n<li>Chambal</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",

  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "Only 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "Narmada, Mahanadi and Son have a radial drainage system. Chambal system represents superimposed drainage pattern. Superimposed drainage is a naturally evolved drainage system that became established on a preexisting surface, now eroded, and whose course is unrelated to the present underlying geological structure. The other examples of superimposed drainage pattern in India are Damodar, Subarnarekha, and Banas river."
