  "question": "Vinoba Bhave was the first person to offer satyagraha. In which year he offered individual satyagraha?",
  "option1": 1939,
  "option2": 1940,
  "option3": 1941,
  "option4": 1942,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 1940,
  "explanation": "The Congress was in a confused state again after the August Offer. The radicals and leftists wanted to launch a mass Civil Disobedience Movement, but here Gandhi insisted on Individual Satyagraha. The Individual Satyagraha was not to seek independence <strong>but to affirm the right of speech.</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The other reason of this Satyagraha was that a mass movement may turn violent and he would <em>not like to see the Great Britain embarrassed by such a situation.</em>This view was conveyed to Lord Linlithgow by Gandhi when he met him on September 27, 1940.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe non-violence was set as the centerpiece of Individual Satyagraha. This was done by carefully selecting the Satyagrahis.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The first Satyagrahi selected was Acharya Vinoba Bhave, who was sent to Jail when he spoke against the war.</li>\r\n<li>Second Satyagrahi was Jawahar Lal Nehru.</li>\r\n<li>Third was Brahma Datt, one of the inmates of the Gandhi’s Ashram.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThey all were sent to jails for violating the Defense of India Act. This was followed by a lot of other people. But since it was not a mass movement, it attracted little enthusiasm and in December 1940, Gandhi suspended the movement. The campaign started again in January 1941, this time, thousands of people joined and around 20 thousand people were arrested."
