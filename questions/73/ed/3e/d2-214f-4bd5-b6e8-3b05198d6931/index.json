  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe union budget 2020-21 had proposed a hike in the bank deposit insurance from the current 1 lakh INR to 5 lakh INR. The move is expected to improve public trust in the banking system and will encourage saving behaviour.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation is a statutory body established by the 1961 act. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the RBI. In case of collapse of a bank, the DICGC will pay the insurance to the depositors.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nThe Damodaran Committee had recommended increasing the insurance cover cap to 5 lakh INR. The committee had reported in 2011 and was constituted for reviewing ‘customer services in banks’. The committee had proposed the hike because of increasing income levels and increasing size of individual bank deposits.\n&nbsp;"
