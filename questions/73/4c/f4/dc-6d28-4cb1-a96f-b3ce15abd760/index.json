  "explanation": "First Interaction of 15th Finance Commission with the Members of Parliament was held on March 14, 2018 in New Delhi. The meeting was held to convey the proposed schedule of the Commission's work and its Terms of Reference (TOR) as well as to seek suggestions of Parliamentarians. In context of this news, it is important to note that unlike previous Finance Commissions, the 15th Finance Commission will function in a different scenario wherein there is no Planning Commission and Government has removed the distinction between Plan and Non Plan grants. In coming days, 15th Finance Commission will conduct meetings with state level stakeholders.",
