  "question": "The DNA data from the Rakhigarhi project has revealed insights into the origin of Harappan Civilisation. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The study showed that the Harappan people are descendants of ancient Iranian farmers.</li>\n<li>The study showed that Harappan people are descendants of ancient farmers from the Steppe region.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Rakhigarhi project in Haryana has been studying the pre-Indus Valley Civilisation sites in the region. Its goal is to understand the origins of the civilisation. Recent DNA sequencing of skeletal remains from a Harappan cemetery found that they were not of Iranian ancestry. It is reported that the civilisation had an independent ancestry.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe results of the study refute the previous theory that the civilisation was derived from Steppe region people. The study shows that these people had evolved their own settled life from hunter gatherer lifestyle to settled agriculturists. Steppe is found in Central Asia and Eastern European regions.\n&nbsp;"
