  "explanation": "The biodynamic agriculture technique involves consideration of celestial and terrestrial influences on biological organisms. The BD cultivation calendar is based on the moon's movement through each zodiac every two-and-a-half days covering all 12 signs every month. Other features of biodynamic farming include crop diversification, the avoidance of chemical soil treatments; off-farm inputs generally, and decentralized production and distribution to \\\"restore, maintain &amp; enhance ecological harmony. Besides following the moon cycle, a BD farmer is advised to use natural composts such as BD 500, which is cow manure packed inside a female cow horn and buried and buried 40-60cm deep in autumn.
