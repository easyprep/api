  "option1": "Ross Island",
  "option2": "Neil Island",
  "option3": "Havelock Island",
  "option4": "Viper Island",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Havelock Island",
  "explanation": "The Central government has decided to rename three popular islands of Andaman and Nicobar to mark the 75th anniversary of Netaji Subhash Chandra Boseâ€™s historic visit to the islands. The names of Ross Island, Neil Island and Havelock Island will be changed to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island, Shaheed Dweep and Swaraj Dweep, respectively. On 30th December 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi  is scheduled to visit Port Blair to make the announcement of name change. He will also release a commemorative stamp and a coin on the occasion.  On 30th December 1943, Bose had hoisted the national flag at the Gymkhana Ground (now Netaji Stadium) in Port Blair and announced that the islands were the first Indian Territory to be freed from British rule. This was done after the Japanese captured the islands during the time of World War II. At that time, Bose reportedly suggested renaming Andaman and Nicobar islands as Shaheed and Swaraj Dweep."
