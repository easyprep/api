  "question": "In context of the ongoing Amarnath Yatra, consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>Amarnath temple is one of the Grand Shakti Peethas.</li>\n<li>About 100 acres of forest land en route to the temple was transferred to the shrineâ€™s board.</li>\n<li>The yatra is covered by CRPF security.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 and 3",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "2 only",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe Amarnath Shrine is located in the Kashmir Himalayas. It is a cave shrine and is one of the 18 Grand Shakthi Peethas sites that are spread across South Asia. These are sacred pilgrim sites of Shaktism branch of Hinduism. Others such sites are in Nepal, Tibet, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe state of Jammu and Kashmir enjoys special rights under the article 370 of constitution. This prevents Indian citizens who are not citizens of J&amp;K from settling or owning land in the state. In 2008, plans were made to transfer the rights of 100 acres of forest land to the shrine board for setting up amenities for the pilgrims. The plan was however scrapped because of this provision.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe yatra has been targeted by militants over the years. Massacres in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2017, etc led to the death of many pilgrims. Hence they are covered by protection from CRPF. This year sees one of the largest such cover. The security is multi-tiered with various measures like UAV surveillance, CCTV coverage, RF ID tagged pilgrim vehicles, etc."
