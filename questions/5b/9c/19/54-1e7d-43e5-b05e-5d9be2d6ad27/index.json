  "answer": "1930-11-11T18:30:00.000Z",
  "explanation": "As per the recommendations of the Simon Commission Report of May 1930, three Round Table Conferences were organized by the British Government during 1930â€“32 to discuss the constitutional reforms in India. The First Round Table Conference was inaugurated in London on 12 November 1930 . The participants were: 16 delegates from the 3 British political parties; 16 delegates from the Princely States; and 57 Indians from the Muslim League (Aga Khan III as their leader), the Hindu Mahasabha (BS Moonje and MR Jaykar), the Indian Liberal Party (Tej Bahadur Sapru, CY Chintamani and Srinivasa Sastri), the Sikhs represented by Sardar Ujjal Singh, and the Depressed Classes represented by Dr BR Ambedkar, etc. The Indian National Congress was not represented as many of its leaders were in jail for the Salt Satyagraha. Wide-ranging matters relating to the Federal Structure, Provincial Constitution, Minorities, Defence, Burma, NWFP, Sindh, and so on were discussed. The idea of an All-India Federation was accepted, as the Muslim League always opposed a strong Centre, where it would be in a minority. A separate electorate for the Depressed Classes as demanded by Dr BR Ambedkar was also considered. However, in the absence of the Congress there could not be much progress. The Conference ended on 19 January 1931."
