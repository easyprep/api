  "question": "In light of the recent success in phasing out the HCFC-141b, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It has a higher ozone depleting potential than the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).</li>\n<li>It is highly toxic and cannot be eliminated from the body once it is inhaled.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe HCFC-141b or the Hydrochlorofluorocarbon-141b is a potent ozone depleting substance. However, it was developed as a shorter lived (in atmosphere) alternative of chlorofluorocarbon. Its ozone depleting potential is lower than CFC but is still a cause for concern. It is mainly used in polyurethane foam manufacturing.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe HCFC-141b has only low inhalation toxicity. Most of the compound is excreted unaltered by exhalation thus reducing potential for causing damage to the living system. The compound was successfully phased out in India in January in pursuance of the Montreal Protocolâ€™s Article 5."
