  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Iceland",
  "explanation": "Iceland houses the glacial lake \"Jokulsarlon\". Jokulsarlon, also known as \"glacial river lagoon\", is a large glacial lake in the southern part of Vatnajokull National Park, Iceland. Situated at the head of the Breidamerkurjokull glacier, it developed into a lake after the glacier started receding from the edge of the Atlantic Ocean. The lake has grown since then at varying rates because of the melting of the glaciers.",
