  "question": "Which of the following physiological indices is/are examined during the polygraphs or lie detectors? \r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Blood pressure</li>\r\n<li>Respiratory rate</li>\r\n<li>Electrodermal activity</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
