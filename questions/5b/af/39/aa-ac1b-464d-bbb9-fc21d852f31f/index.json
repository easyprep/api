  "answer": "China",
  "explanation": "According to data from Oil Ministry\\'s Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell, China is the world’s largest importer of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), where as India toppled Japan to acquire second position. It is because of Indian government’s drive to provide free cooking connections to women from extremely poor households resulted in 32.5 million new LPG connections being added in FY17. The government’s efforts have pushed up India’s active LPG user count to about 200 million. It aims to increase the households using LPG to 80% of total households in India by FY19 from 72.8% as on April 1, 2017. On the other hand, Japan is cutting back on LPG as cooking fuel and is moving to cheaper alternatives such as natural gas. According to World Health Organisation (WHO), hazardous cooking fuels like wood and cow dung cause air pollution on burning and are responsible for 1.3 million pre-mature deaths a year."
