  "explanation": "Soils are the product of complex mixture of weathered and eroded rock material on the one hand and organic residues on the other. Most soils contain decayed plant and animal materials, collectively called humus. Humus rich soils have a good capacity for water retention. Humus supplies a soil with nutrients and minerals, and is important in chemical reaction that help plants extract nutrients. Humus also provides an abundant food an abundant food source for microscopic soil organisms."
