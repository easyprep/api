  "answer": "Blue, Yellow, Black, Green, Red",
  "explanation": "Blue, Yellow, Black, Green, Red are the colours of the rings present in the symbol of the Olympic Games. The rings are five interlocking rings, coloured blue, yellow, black, green and red on a white field, known as the \"Olympic rings\". The symbol was originally created in 1913 by Pierre de Coubertin. He appears to have intended the rings to represent the five continents: Europe, Asia, Africa, The Americas, and Oceania. According to Coubertin, the colours of the rings together with the white of the background included the colours composing every competing nation's flag at the time."
