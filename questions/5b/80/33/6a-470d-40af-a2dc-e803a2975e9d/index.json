  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because &quot;<em>Sweet sorghum</em>&quot; is not a leguminous crop. Sweet Sorghum is a&nbsp;cereal&nbsp;grain. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u> because Sorghum originates in the tropical areas of Africa, and it is unable to sustain itself in cool temperatures or the long days in temperate climate."
