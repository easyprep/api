  "question": "Indiaâ€™s first roll on- roll off (Ro-Ro) vessel passenger service has been proposed to be started in which state?",
  "option1": "Andhra Pradesh",
  "option2": "Gujarat",
  "option3": "West Bengal",
  "option4": "Odisha",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Gujarat",
  "explanation": "Gujarat&#8217;s Dahej is all set to get India&#8217;s first roll on-roll off (Ro-Ro) vessel passenger ferry services around April 2017. The Rs 550 crore projects being executed by the Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB), and is expected to bring down travel time between Saurashtra regions in Gujarat with its Southern parts significantly. From Ghoga in Saurashtra to Dahej in South Gujarat takes around 10-12 hours for trucks and buses, and even by cars it is not less than 6-8 hours. Once the Ro-Ro ferry service commences, this time would be dramatically shortened to one and a half hours. Roll-on/roll-off (RORO or ro-ro) ships are vessels designed to carry wheeled cargo, such as cars, trucks, semi-trailer trucks, trailers, and railroad cars that are driven on and off the ship on their own wheels or using a platform vehicle, such as a self-propelled modular transporter. This is in contrast to lift-on/lift-off (Lolo) vessels, which use a crane to load and unload cargo. Roll-on/Roll-off or &#8216;Ro-Ro&#8217; services for freight transport have being proposed to be introduced at five places &#8211; Kolkata, Sahibganj, Varanasi, Patna and Bhagalpur besides setting up small terminals at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore."
