  "question": "Why Taj Mahal is reported to be in danger?",
  "option1": "Water pollution in Jamuna",
  "option2": "Stealing of marble bricks",
  "option3": "Decay of marble due to its age factor",
  "option4": "Air pollution due to nearby industries",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Air pollution due to nearby industries",
  "explanation": "It is the acid rain that is most dangerous for the monument. Indeed, the inadvertent emission of sulfuric oxide from nearby industries, due to road traffic, causes acid rain. This rain colors the Taj Mahal yellow, tarnishing it, and, worse, it erodes it, attacking what is most fragile at first: the sculptures and incrustations of stone."
