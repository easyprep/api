  "question": "The researchers of which country have developed  the world’s first bio-electronic medicine?",
  "option1": "Germany",
  "option2": "United Kingdom",
  "option3": "United States",
  "option4": "France",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "United States",
  "explanation": "Researchers at the Washington University in the US have developed the world’s first bio-electronic medicine — an implantable, biodegradable wireless device that speeds nerve regeneration and improves the healing of a damaged nerve. According to the study published in the journal Nature Medicine, the device is the size of a dime and the thickness of a sheet of paper.The technology, called “bioelectronicmedicine,” provides therapy and treatment over a clinically relevant period of time and directly at the site where it’s needed, thereby reducing side-effects or risks associated with conventional, permanent implants. Though, the device has not been tested in humans, the findings offer promise as a future therapeutic option for nerve injury patients."
