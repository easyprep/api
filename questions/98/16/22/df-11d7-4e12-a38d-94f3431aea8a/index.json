He also represented Sindri in the Bihar Assembly in 1967, 1969 and 1972. Along with Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) supremo Shibu Soren and former MP, the late Binod Bihari Mahto, Roy began the Jharkhand movement that demanded a separate State from Bihar in 1971. Jharkhand became a separate State on November 15, 2000. Roy was called a ‘political saint’ by his associates and followers, as his bank account always showed a ‘zero’ balance."
