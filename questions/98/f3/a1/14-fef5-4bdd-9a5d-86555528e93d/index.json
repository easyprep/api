The floating market is located on lake at Patuli in South Kolkata which is 400 metres long and 60 metres wide. The lake has been transformed into the floating market similar to the one in Thailand. The aim of floating market is to rehabilitate over 200 shopkeepers from nearby market that was demolished for the widening of Eastern Metropolitan Bypass (EMB) - an important road that connects the northern parts of Kolkata o the eastern and southern tips. The market will host at least 114 boats, each one accommodating two shops. These shops will sell regular or daily-use items that include vegetables, fruits, flowers, fish and meat and poultry. Shoppers can approach these boats through wooden walkways.",
