The quick reaction time and high rate of fire of the system gives an edge to the army during a low-intensity conflict situation. The unguided rocket system is meant to neutralise large areas with rapid salvos.Pinaka system can fire a salvo of 12 rockets in 44 seconds. The battery of six launchers can neutralise at a time a target area of 3.9 sq km.
