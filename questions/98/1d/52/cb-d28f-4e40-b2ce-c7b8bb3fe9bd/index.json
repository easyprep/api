  "option2": "The Cells walls have more Peptidoglycan compared to Lipids",
  "option3": "The Cells membrane has more fatty acids",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "The Cells walls have more Peptidoglycan compared to Lipids",
  "explanation": "The cell wall which is made up of Peptidoglycan as well as lipids gets violet due to the reaction of the CV+. After the decolorization with alcohol, the lipids gets dissolved and the bacteria with higher Peptidoglycan remain violet. These are called Gram Positive bacteria."
