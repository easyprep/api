  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nTurkey had received UNESCO listing of its whistled language as one of the intangible cultural heritages that require urgent protection. The Turkish Bird language was originally used by farmers. Whistled language is the use of whistling to simulate or articulate words according to UNESCO.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nUNESCO considers artefacts, objects, instruments and cultural spaces as well as knowledge, expressions, traditions, etc. for listing as intangible cultural heritage. Japan’s Noh mask is one such object. India has 13 such intangible cultural heritage listings such as Yoga, Kumbh Mela and brass and copper utensils of Thatheras in Punjab."
