  "question": "With reference to the discussions surrounding the devolution limit and finance commission, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The finance commission does both vertical and horizontal devolution.</li>\n<li>The finance commission can interpret the Terms of Reference elements.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe article 280 of constitution provides that the finance commission can decide both the horizontal and vertical devolution. Vertical devolution is the distribution of the net tax proceedings between the centre and the states. Horizontal devolution is the distribution of the net tax proceedings among the states.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe finance commission can interpret the elements under the ToR. ToR defines the structure and purpose of the committee. This is because it is a constitutionally appointed body (appointed by the President). The ToR of the FC15 was debated because of the talks to shift from 1971 census figures to 2011 figures for the devolution."
