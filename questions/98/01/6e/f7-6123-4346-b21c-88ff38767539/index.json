  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about the Angle of Repose?<br />\n<ol>\n<li> If the actual slope angle is more than the angle of repose, the slope is stable.</li>\n<li> If the actual slope angle is greater than the angle of repose, mass movement can occur.</li>\n<li>The angle of repose changes as slope conditions changes.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "Only 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Angle of Repose is the maximum angle at which slope material can be inclined without moving downslope. It is a critical value for stability for a particular slope. If the actual slope angle is<strong> less</strong> than the angle of repose, the slope is stable."
