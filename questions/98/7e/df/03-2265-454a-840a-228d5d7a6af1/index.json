  "question": "What changes are made by a flute player when he / she opens and closes the holes in the body of the flute?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Change in pitch of the sound</li>\r\n<li>Change resonant frequency</li>\r\n<li>Change in the length of resonator</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The player changes the pitch of the sound produced by opening and closing holes in the body of the instrument, thus changing the effective length of the resonator and its corresponding resonant frequency. Pitch can be changed via a change in air pressure also, so that air in the flute can resonate at a harmonic other than the fundamental frequency without opening or closing any holes."
