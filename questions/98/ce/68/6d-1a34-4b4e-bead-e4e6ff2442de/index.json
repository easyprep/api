  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Global Alliance on Health and Pollution report of 2019 listed India as the country with the maximum number of premature deaths due to pollution. 2.3 million people died prematurely due to pollution in India in 2017. However, the highest incidence of death due to pollution per 1 lakh people is in Chad (287 deaths for every 1 lakh people).\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe GAHP report included India in all three categories: high incidence of death due to pollution of air, water and workplace. It is the only country in all 3 lists. The report showed that traditional sources of pollution has been replaced by modern sources."
