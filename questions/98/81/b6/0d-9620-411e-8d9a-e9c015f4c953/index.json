  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "Patanjali’s sutras (threads) or aphorisms are a synthesis of yoga written in India around the 2nd century BC this work is considered to be complete and is to this day followed by almost all gurus (teachers of yoga). Also known as the eight step path, there are eight aspects as follows: <strong>Yamas</strong> Disengagement, this is a process whereby the yogi takes his attention off of the endless distractions of worldly pleasures and directs it toward merging with his higher self. <strong>Niyamas</strong> Nonattachment , A process of learning to discriminate between that which is necessary for survival and those things which are trappings (wealth, power, fame, etc). <strong>Asana</strong> preparing the body for meditation, put the body into a comfortable seated position in such a way that it will be able to stay still for an extended length of time. this will prevent the body from causing any distractions during meditation. <strong>Pranayama</strong> Regulation of breathing: Regulate the breathing into slow, quiet, rhythmic patterns. This will help to calm and quiet the body and the mind in preparation for meditation. <strong>Pratyahara</strong> Conscious withdrawal of the five senses concentrate on turning the five senses off until there are no physical distractions. Another way of viewing this is that you are simply choosing not to respond to the physical senses. \n<strong>Dharana</strong> Interrupted fixation, choose an object on which to focus the attention (like a candle, sound, word, etc). the concentration will be frequently interrupted by thoughts or distractions. Just notice the thought or distraction and then return to concentrating on the object. \n<strong>Dhyana</strong> Uninterrupted fixation, focus the attention on an object until there are no more mental interruptions or distractions. The mind is totally quiet and there is no awareness of separation between you and the object. \n<strong>Samadhi</strong> Knowing directly higher self, Samadhi is the state of yoga where the yogi has completely merged with his higher self. There is no concept of an “I” an identity that perceives itself as separate from everything else. There is a direct connection or union with all there is."
