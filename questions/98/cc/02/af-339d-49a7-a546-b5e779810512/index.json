  "question": "Indicators such as litmus can be used to determine: <ol> <li>Acidity or alkalinity of a solution</li> <li>pH value of a solution</li> </ol> Select the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "Common indicators, like litmus, methyl orange and phenolphthalein easily detect whether a solution is acidic or alkaline, but they cannot easily determine how much a given acidic solution is stronger than another acidic solution. It means they cannot really tell us the pH value of different acidic or alkaline solutions. In case of litmus, we cannot tell about pH values of 5, 6 and 7. Similarly, in case of methyl orange pH values between 3 and 8 will not be very accurate."
