  "question": "The researchers at which IIT have designed a system to recycle urine?",
  "option1": "IIT Bombay",
  "option2": "IIT Indore",
  "option3": "IIT Kanpur",
  "option4": "IIT Madras",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "IIT Madras",
  "explanation": "The researchers at IIT Madras have designed a system titled ‘Project Water Chakra’  to recycle human  urine.  The project won the Indian Innovation Growth Programme 2.0 award in July 2019. The researchers have retrofitted urinals on the campus to collect urine i.e. then processed into several useful materials for use in manufacturing. The concentrated urine is stored for 3 days to allow the urea to get converted to ammonia. By a process of steam distillation, the ammonia is segregated and this commercial grade liquid can be used to make cleaning products, such as detergents or in rubber manufacturing. Then, to precipitate phosphorus through struvite process, magnesium is added to the rest of the liquid. Hence, through electrochemical process we can recover 90% of water and it can be used for gardening purposes and flushing."
