  "question": "With reference to the recent debate surrounding Endosulfan in Kerala, consider the following statements about the chemical:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Stockholm Convention imposed a ban on manufacture and use of endosulfan.</li>\n<li>It is a broad spectrum insecticide.</li>\n<li>Use of endosulfan completely banned in India.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 3 is correct",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutant was held in 2011. It passed a global ban on the manufacture and sale of endosulfan. India had been opposing the ban and had requested time till 2017 to phase out the insecticideâ€™s use.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nEndosulfan is a wide spectrum insecticide i.e. it does not affect a single specific pest but a range of insects. The affected insects may even include beneficial organisms like bees. The pesticide came into focus during the Kasargode incident where the pesticide used for cashew cultivation resulted in adverse health effects on the cultivators.\n<strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe pesticide was banned by the Supreme Court in 2011. Currently, a general ban exists on the pesticide. However, it is used in exceptional cases like bollworm infestation in cotton fields with no other alternative. The state governments are in the process of paying compensation to endosulfan victims."
