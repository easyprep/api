  "question": "A man can row 15 km/hr downstream and 9 km/hr upstream, the speed of the boat in still water is :",
  "option1": "8 km/hr",
  "option2": "10 km/hr",
  "option3": "12 km/hr",
  "option4": "15 km/hr",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "12 km/hr",
  "explanation": "Speed of boat in still water =\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{1}{2}(Rate downstream + Rate upstream) = \\\\frac{1}{2}(15+9)&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\times 24 = 12 km/hr&s=1$\r\nHence option [C] is correct answer."
