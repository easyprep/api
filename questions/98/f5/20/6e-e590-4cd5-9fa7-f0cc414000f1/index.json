The Pulitzer board stated that the album is a virtuosic song collection unified by its vernacular authenticity and rhythmic dynamism that offers affecting vignettes capturing the complexity of modern African-American life. Lamar is known to have had a deep impact on a racially fraught America and has emerged as the bona fide King of Rap. Apart from this, Andrew Sean Greer took home the Pulitzer in Fiction for his comic queer novel \\\"Less\\\". In Letters and Drama category, Caroline Fraser\\'s Prairie Fires won the prestigious award for Biography and Martyna Majok\\'s acclaimed off-Broadway play \\'Cost of Living\\' won the Pulitzer for Drama. Each winner will receive a certificate and a $15,000 cash award."
