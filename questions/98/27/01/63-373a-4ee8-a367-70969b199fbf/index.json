  "question": "The Ghost Orchid Plant is being discussed in context with the effect of water scarcity on protected species. In this context, consider the following statements about this plant:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The plant performs photosynthesis in its roots.</li>\n<li>It is an endangered species.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe ghost orchid is an epiphyte, which means that it grows on top of trees. It does not have photosynthetic leaves. This function is instead performed by its roots. The specialised root also performs respiration. The root has a structure called velamen that absorbs water and nutrients for the plant.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:        </strong>\nThe ghost orchid is an endangered species. It is threatened by water scarcity and drying out of its habitat. Apart from this, it is very difficult to cultivate. They cannot survive when removed from their natural habitat. They are also listed under the CITES Appendix II."
