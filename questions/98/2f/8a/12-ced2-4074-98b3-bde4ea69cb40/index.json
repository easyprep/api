  "explanation": "• The islets of Langerhans are a cluster of cells within the pancreas that are responsible for the production and release of hormones that regulate glucose levels.<br />• Growth hormone is also called somatotropin or human growth hormone, peptide hormone. It is secreted by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. It stimulates the growth of essentially all tissues of the body, including bone.<br />• Calcitonin is a hormone that is produced in humans by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland. Calcitonin is involved in helping to regulate levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood, opposing the action of parathyroid hormone.<br />• Hormones secreted by the adrenal medulla are Epinephrine. Most people know epinephrine by its other name—adrenaline. This hormone rapidly responds to stress by increasing your heart rate and rushing blood to the muscles and brain."
