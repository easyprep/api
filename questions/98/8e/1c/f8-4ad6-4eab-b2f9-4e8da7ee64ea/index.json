  "question": "Which among the following is oceans is the largest consistent contributor to the global ocean warming trends in last few decades?",
  "option1": "Indian Ocean",
  "option2": "Pacific Ocean",
  "option3": "Atlantic Ocean",
  "option4": "Arctic Ocean",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Indian Ocean",
  "explanation": "The Indian Ocean has been warming at a rate faster than thought before (1.2 deg C during the past century). It is also the largest consistent contributor to the global ocean warming trends. Recent studies show that a warm Indian Ocean can in turn modulate the Pacific conditions including the El Nino events. So basically, such large warming over the Indian Ocean has implications on the global climate."
