  "question": "In light of Cyclone Kyarr turning into a super-cyclone, consider the following statements about this phenomenon:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Super-cyclones are low pressure systems.</li>\n<li>It rotates in the counter-clockwise direction in the northern hemisphere.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nSuper cyclones are low pressure systems. It has speeds of 120 knots and above. Winds always flow from region of high pressure to regions of low pressures. The winds move radially inwards towards the eye. The system is mostly formed in the troposphere.\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe super-cyclone is a type of tropical cyclone. Tropical cyclones that are formed in the northern hemisphere rotate in the counter clockwise direction. This is because of the Coriolis Effect. The coriolis force is generated by the earth’s spin. It is highest at the poles and lowest at the equator."
