  "option1": 13,
  "option2": 14,
  "option3": 15,

  "option5": "",
  "answer": 16,
  "explanation": "If the average of remaining numbers be x, then\r\n20 $latex \\\\times$ 15 = 5 $latex \\\\times$ 12 + 15 x\r\n=> 300 = 60 + 15 x\r\n=> 15 x = 300 - 60 = 240\r\n$latex => x = \\\\frac{240}{15} = 16&s=1$\r\nHence option [D] is correct answer"
