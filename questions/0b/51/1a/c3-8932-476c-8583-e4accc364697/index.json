  "question": "A man can swim at 3km/hr in still water. If the velocity of the stream is 2km/hr, the time taken by him to swim to a place 10 km upstream and back is :",
  "option1": "12 hours",
  "option2": "10 hours",
  "option3": "$latex 8\\frac{1}{3}hours&s=1$",
  "option4": "$latex 9\\frac{1}{3}hours&s=1$",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "12 hours",
  "explanation": "Rate downstream = 5 kmph\r\nRate upstream = 1 kmph\r\nâˆ´ Required time = $latex \\\\frac{10}{5}+\\\\frac{10}{1} = 12 hours&s=1$\r\nHence option [A] is the right answer."
