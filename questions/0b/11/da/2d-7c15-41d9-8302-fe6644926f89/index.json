  "question": "Which of the following comparisons of different types of lights is / are correct?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Ultraviolet light has a higher energy and shorter wavelength than visible light</li>\r\n<li>Orange light has a lower frequency and longer wavelength than blue light</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Gamma rays and X-rays are very high-energy, short-wavelength radiations. Ultraviolet light has a higher energy and shorter wavelength than visible light. Within the visible spectrum, the colors are—in order of increasing frequency—ROYGBV, so orange light (“O”) has a lower frequency—and thus a longer wavelength—than blue light (“B”)."
