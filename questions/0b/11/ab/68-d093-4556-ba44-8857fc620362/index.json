  "answer": "Washington",
  "explanation": "India has recently submitted proposals regarding changes to the listing of five wildlife species viz. smooth-coated otter, small-clawed otter, Indian star tortoise, Tokay gecko, wedgefish and Indian rosewood in the CITES secretariat meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. The species are facing two threats: loss of habitat to agriculture and illegal harvesting for the pet trade. Hence, India seeks to boost the protection of all the 5 wildlife species as they are facing a high risk of international trade.  India is among the parties proposing the re-listing of the species from CITES Appendix II to Appendix I. The CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species on Wild Fauna and Flora) is an international treaty to ensure that trade in wild animals and plants do not threaten their survival. The headquarters of CITES is at Washington DC."
