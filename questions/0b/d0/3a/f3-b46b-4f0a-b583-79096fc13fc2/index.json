  "answer": "",
  "explanation": "When a ray of light enters the glass prism it gets deviated two times. First when it enters the glass prism and second when it comes out of the prism. This is because the refracting surfaces of the prism are not parallel to each other. Also, when the ray of light passes through the prism it bends towards its base."
