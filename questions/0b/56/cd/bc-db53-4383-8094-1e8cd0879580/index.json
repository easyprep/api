  "question": "The newly proposed 0/10 and 0/20 rules are associated to which ministry?",
  "option1": "Ministry of Civil Aviation",
  "option2": "Ministry of Railways",
  "option3": "Ministry of Shipping",
  "option4": "Ministry of Steel",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Ministry of Civil Aviation",
  "explanation": "The 5/20 rule is a norm of the Indian Aviation Ministry according to which under which national carriers are required to have five years of operational experience and a fleet of minimum 20 aircraft to fly overseas. Recently, the Cabinet gave its approval for partial abolition of the 5/20 rule, which will enable new carriers like Vistara and Air Asia to start international operations sooner. The government has decided to scrap a requirement that mandated airlines to have five years of domestic operations to be eligible to fly overseas. However, an airline will have to allocate 20 aircraft or 20% of their total fleet of aircraft, whichever is higher, to the domestic sector if they wish to fly overseas. So in place of 5/20 rule, the new proposed options are like 0/10 and 0/20."
