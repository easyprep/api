It houses the Great Sand Sea and Silica Glass Area and Gabal El Uweinat massif. The Great Sand Sea is a large complex of sand dunes extending from the Siwa Oasis in the north to the Gilf Kebir in the south. The Gilf Kebir is a plateau, furrowed by immense north-trending wadis. The area was settled by a population already at the beginning of the Neolithic area some 9000 years ago during the African humid period, leaving splendid rock paintings and engravings of uncertain age in the wadi Hamra and in the caves of Beasts, Swimmers, Archers and Magharet el Kantara on its southern foothills."
