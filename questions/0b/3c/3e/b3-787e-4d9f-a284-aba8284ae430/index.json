  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nA country can have multiple consulates in a foreign state. However, there is only one embassy per state. The embassy serves as the main office representing the country in that foreign state. Consulates are smaller diplomatic missions located in major cities of the foreign state.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe term High Commission is used to refer to the embassy of one Commonwealth nation in another Commonwealth nation. Eg: India has a High Commission in Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Embassies are generally located in the capital of the state."
