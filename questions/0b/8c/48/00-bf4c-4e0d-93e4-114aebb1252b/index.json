  "question": "The drug Aducanumab has been in news recently. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The drug is used to slow cognitive decline during advanced stages of Alzheimer’s disease.</li>\n<li>The drug targets beta amyloid proteins.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe drug Aducanumab is used to slow the cognitive decline during early stages of Azheimer’s disease. It is awaiting approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. If approved, this would become the first therapy to reduce clinical decline in Alzheimer’s patients.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe drug targets the beta amyloid proteins. These proteins aggregate and form plaques in the brain. The deposition of plaque in the neurons damages the cells and lead to cognitive decline. However, the cause of such abnormally high aggregation of beta amyloid proteins is the neurons is unknown."
