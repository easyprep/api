  "option2": "1 and 2",
  "option3": "2 only",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\n“Pay and Publish” journals are those that publish research articles irrespective of the quality of content upon payment by the author. These are also called predatory journals. Researchers resort to publishing in such journals to gain academic credits to avail scholarship, higher research posts, etc. The panel had called for non-consideration of such publications.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe UGC had published the CARE or consortium of academic and research ethics. The CARE scrutinises and publishes a list of verified journals in various research fields – life science, social sciences, etc to be considered for scholarships, research funding, etc. these count as “credible quality journals”.\n<strong>Statement 3</strong> is correct:\nThe Balram panel had recommended the setting up of a separate board for social sciences. It also called for provision for 100 post-doctoral fellowship annually in the fields of humanities, social sciences, etc. Other recommendations include establishment of R&amp;D Dean in every institute, internships in policy organisations on a short term basis, etc."
