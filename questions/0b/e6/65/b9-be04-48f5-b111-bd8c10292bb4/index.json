  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about Salinity of ocean water?<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Salinity increases from equator towards the poles.</li>\r\n<li>Highest salinity is recorded at the equator.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "Salinity increases from equator towards the poles.<br />The highest salinity is not recorded near the equator (high temperature and evaporation, but rainfall reduces salinity). Hence, it records only 35% salinity."
