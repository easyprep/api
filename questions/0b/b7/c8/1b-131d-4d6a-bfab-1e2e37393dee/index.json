  "answer": "Singapore",
  "explanation": "On 4 July 1943, two days after reaching Singapore, Bose assumed the leadership of the IIL and the INA in a ceremony at Cathay Building. Bose\\'s influence was notable. His appeal re-invigorated the INA, which had previously consisted mainly of prisoners of war: it also attracted Indian expatriates in South Asia. The Indian National Army (INA) was originally founded by Capt. Mohan Singh in Singapore in September 1942 with Japan\\'s Indian POWs . This was along the concept of- and with support of- what was then known as the Indian Independence League, headed by expatriate nationalist leader Rash Bihari Bose."
