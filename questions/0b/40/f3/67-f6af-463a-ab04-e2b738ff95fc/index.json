  "answer": "Egypt",
  "explanation": "Bibliotheca Alexandrina, the Library of Alexandria, is the national library of Egypt which is located in the Alexandria city on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea. It is both a commemoration of the Library of Alexandria that was lost in antiquity and an attempt to rekindle something of the brilliance that this earlier centre of study and erudition represented. This initiative by the Egyptian government, UNESCO, and Alexandria University was undertaken with the aim of re-establishing Alexandria as one of the great intellectual and cultural centres of the twenty-first century."
