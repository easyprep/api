  "answer": "Ethiopia",
  "explanation": "Blue Nile River is a major tributary of the Nile Basin Watershed which originates from Lake Tana, which is the largest lake in Ethiopia. This river supplies 80% of the water in the Nile during the rainy season. This river, after originating from Ethiopia, flows to Sudan which then joins with the White Nile River in Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan, forming the main branch of Nile River. Ethiopia's controversial Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is located in this river, which is a subject matter of dispute with Egypt."
