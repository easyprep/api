  "question": "The title \"Father of the Nation\" to Gandhiji was given by who among the following?",
  "option1": "C.R. Das",
  "option2": "Jawaharlal Nehru",
  "option3": "R.N. Tagore",
  "option4": "S.C. Bose",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "S.C. Bose",
  "explanation": "In the year 1944, Subhash Chandra Bose used the phrase for Gandhi when he was briefing on Singapore Radio. However, Gandhi was never accorded either Mahatma or Father of the Nation title officially by Government of India and no rule or ordinance was ever passed; and can be passed since it would be against article 18. So, Mahatma Gandhi as \"Father of Nation\" is a popular notion."
