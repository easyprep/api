  "option1": "1 and 3",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 and 2",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nPreviously known as the Rajasthan canal. It is India’s longest canal, measuring about 650km. It is a part of India’s green revolution. Its purposes include irrigation, drinking water supply, increasing area under cultivation, etc. It originates from the Harike barrage, located at a distance from the meeting point of Satluj and Beas.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe canal connects the Himalayan Rivers- Ravi, Beas and Sutlej (tributaries of Indus) with the deserts of Thar. This connection brought a large area of Rajasthan under cultivation. The water from the canal enabled cultivation of mustard, wheat and cotton in the previously barren areas. In Rajasthan, the canal represents the sole water source in several areas.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe canal passes through the states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. The canal improved the standard of living of many in Rajasthan. However, problems of leakage and structural damage has led to low supply coverage in the tail-end areas. Rajasthan government had previously signed loan agreements with New Development Bank for renovating the canal infrastructure. Now the government is in talks with Punjab government for relining of feeder canals."
