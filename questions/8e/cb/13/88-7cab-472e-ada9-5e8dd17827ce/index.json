  "answer": "94th",
  "explanation": "Constitution (94th) Amendment Act, 2006 freed Bihar from the obligation of having a tribal welfare minister and extended the same provision to Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. This provision is now applicable to Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha as per article 164. Thus, existing Article-164 of the Constitution says that in the states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha, there shall be a Minister in charge of tribal welfare who may in addition be in charge of the welfare of the Scheduled Castes and backward classes or any other work."
