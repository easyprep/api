  "answer": "Google",
  "explanation": "The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has imposed Rs.136 crore fine on world's most popular search engine Google for unfair business practices in Indian market for online search. The penalty was imposed on Google for infringing anti-trust conduct. CCI passed the penalty order on complaints filed in 2012 by Matrimony.com and Consumer Unity & Trust Society (CUTS) in 2012. It was alleged that Google is indulging in abuse of dominant position in market for online search through practices leading to search bias and search manipulation, among others. CCI's ruling comes after similar anti-trust setbacks for Google in European Union and Russia. In 2017, in similar case EU's anti-trust arm had fined Google $2.7 billion for promoting its own products over others. Google also had settled an anti-trust matter in Russia out of court.",
