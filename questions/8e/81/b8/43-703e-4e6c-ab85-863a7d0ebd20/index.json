  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about distribution of population?<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Temperature and rainfall are the climatic elements having the most profound impact on population distribution.</li>\r\n<li>Areas of rugged terrain have always had a lower density of population.</li>\r\n<li>The swamps and marshes are examples of areas with a high density of population.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "A variety of factors have been responsible for the uneven distribution of population in the world.<br />Areas of rugged terrain have always had a lower density of population. Valleys and lowlands with near level surface have been the chief areas of attraction for large populations since earliest times.<br />Areas suffering from poor drainage conditions do not attract large populations. The swamps and marshes are examples of areas with a low density of population due to poor drainage conditions."
