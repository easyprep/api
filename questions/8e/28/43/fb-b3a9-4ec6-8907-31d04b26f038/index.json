  "answer": "1930-04-05T18:30:00.000Z",
  "explanation": "The government had levied tax on the manufacture and sale of salt, an item used by all—rich and poor. To Gandhi breaking the Salt Law was something which could help in mass mobilization and everyone could participate in it—scoop salt at the coast, or just sell and buy salt without paying tax. Gandhi started a 390 km march from his Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad to the coastal Gujarat village of Dandi near Navsari. 78 people began the march with Gandhi on 12 March 1930, and arrived at Dandi after a 24-day walk on 5 April 1930, breaking the Salt Law at 6.30am the next day on 6 April 1930. Thousands of people had joined the group along the way. After Dandi, Gandhi had planned satyagraha at the Dharasana Salt Works, 40 km south of Dandi. However, he was arrested on the midnight of 4–5 May 1930. Still, Manilal, Gandhi’s second son, and Sarojini Naidu led 2500 satyagrahis to Dharasana Salt Works on 21 May 1930. As they approached the Works, they were lathicharged injuring hundreds of them."
