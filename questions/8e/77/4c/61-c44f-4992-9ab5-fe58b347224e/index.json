  "answer": "Badri Narain Sharma",
  "explanation": "Badri Narain Sharma, a Rajasthan cadre IAS officer of 1985 batch, has been re-appointed as chairman of the National Anti-profiteering Authority (NAA) for next two years. The NAA ensures that consumers get benefit of reduced prices under the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The NAA  has been constituted under Section 171 of the Central GST Act of 2017 to ensure that the reduction in rate of tax or the benefit of input tax credit is passed on to the recipient by way of commensurate reduction in prices. The NAA has the power to cancel registration of any entity or business if it fails to pass on to consumers the benefit of lower taxes under the GST regime, but it would probably be the last step against any violator."
