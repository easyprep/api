  "question": "In which of the following cases, the level of mercury in a barometer would fall?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It is taken from sea level to a high altitude</li>\r\n<li>A storm is approaching</li>\r\n<li>Radius of barometer is increased</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Mercury barometer is used for measuring atmospheric pressure. Because atmospheric pressure changes with distance above or below sea level, a barometer can also be used to measure altitude. There is no change in the mercury level when the radius of tube in the barometer is increased."
