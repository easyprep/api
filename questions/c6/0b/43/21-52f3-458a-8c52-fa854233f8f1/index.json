  "question": "In light of studies highlighting the impact of power infrastructure on Osprey migration, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Ospreys are birds of prey.</li>\n<li>Ospreys are an endangered species.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nOspreys are birds of prey which are also known as fish hawk. They feed on fish, have a cosmopolitan distribution and are noted for their diurnal behaviour. Osprey pairs bond for life and migrate over long distances. Recent studies tracked their migration from Russia to Indian states.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nOspreys are common birds of prey. They are found in all the tropical and temperate regions. They move northwards in summer and southwards in winters. The recent research was aimed at determining the cause of decline in their population in Russiaâ€™s Altai Sayan region."
