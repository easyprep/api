  "question": "Which Indian state approved the Khatua panel’s recommendation to slash the fare prices of autorickshaws by 15 per cent for selected hours of a day?",
  "option1": "Karnataka",
  "option2": "Uttar Pradesh",
  "option3": "Maharashtra",
  "option4": "Kerala",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Maharashtra",
  "explanation": "The Maharashtra government has approved the Khatua panel’s recommendation to slash the fare prices of auto-rickshaws by 15 per cent between 12 pm and 4 pm. \r\nThis discount in fare is called as implementation of \\\"happy hour\\\" for auto-rickshaws by the state government. However, this is not applicable to app-based taxis and local cabs. This will help the senior citizens of the state but the auto-rickshaw unions expressed their displeasure at the government\\'s step."
