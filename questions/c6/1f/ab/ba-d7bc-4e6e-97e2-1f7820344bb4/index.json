  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "<strong>They are generally regular and equally distributed winds – Incorrect</strong> <br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Monsoon winds are not equally distributed winds; because they don’t blow evenly. This is the reason of unequal distribution of rainfall all over India.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>They show a complete reversal of direction during a year – Correct</strong> <br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>This is a correct statement and is main feature of monsoon winds.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>They are generally orographic in nature - Correct</strong> <br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>This is also a correct statement. Rainfall due to monsoon winds is mainly orographic (relief) in nature, particularly in India.</li>\r\n</ul>"
