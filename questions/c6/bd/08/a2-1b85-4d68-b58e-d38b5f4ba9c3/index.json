  "question": "Which of the following is / are examples of invisible exports?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>A doctor in India providing diagnosis, treatment and medical education for fee in a remote part of Africa</li>\r\n<li>A patient in UAE gets treatment in a hospital in Gurgaon in India</li>\r\n<li>A smuggler sends gold from India to abroad via illegal channels</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Invisible export is basically export of services. The first statement (A doctor in India providing diagnosis, treatment and medical education in a remote part of Africa) is basically mode-1 of WTOâ€™s GATS services trade. Statement 2 (A patient in UAE gets treatment in a hospital in Gurgaon in India) is mode-2 whereby the foreigner consumes services in India. So both these are examples of invisible export. Third one is incorrect."
