  "question": "With regards to the recent incidence of dust storms in Australia after the wildfires and the flashfloods, consider the following statements about dust storms:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Saltation is one of the processes involved in dust storm.</li>\n<li>Dust storms cause depletion of nutrients in the South American rainforests.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nDust storms are meteorological phenomenon in which winds blow up the loosely held sand and dust particles in arid and semi- arid regions. Saltation and suspension are the two main processes involved in dust storm formation. Saltation is the process by which loose particles are carried off the ground by winds and let it strike back at the surface to loosen more particles.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nDust storm is one of the major cause of land degradation due to top soil loss. However, it is not completely deleterious. The South American rainforests are kept nutrient fed by the Saharan dust storms which transport the loosened nutrient filled sand particles from one continent to the next."
