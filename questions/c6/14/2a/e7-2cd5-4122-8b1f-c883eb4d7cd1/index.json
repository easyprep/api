  "option1": "Bats have a better vision in the dark",
  "option2": "The light startles them",
  "option3": "Bats produce high pitched sounds ultrasonic",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Bats produce high pitched sounds ultrasonic",
  "explanation": "The sounds that bats make are so high pitched that humans cannot hear them. High pitched sounds like this are called ultrasound. So, bats make high pitched squeaks while they fly. The echoes travel back to the bat and it can then tell how far away the objects are. <br />Bats use echoes or reflected sounds to determine the surrounding situation and to locate their prey. Often we see the bats fly at night. They fly in the dark so quickly without hitting anything. This process is called echolocation."
