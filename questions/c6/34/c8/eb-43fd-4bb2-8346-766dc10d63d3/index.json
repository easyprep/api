But it was only ten years later that an expedition of Portuguese\r\nships headed out to India (in 1497) and arrived in India in slightly less than eleven monthsâ€™ time, in May 1498.He stayed in India for three months and carried back with a rich cargo. That time the importance of pepper trade was realized for the first time by the Europeans."
