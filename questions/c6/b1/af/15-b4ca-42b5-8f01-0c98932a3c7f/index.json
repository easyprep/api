  "question": "Which of the following Green House Gases are released in atmosphere by farming practices?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Carbon Dioxide</li>\r\n<li>Methane</li>\r\n<li>Nitrous Oxide</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Besides carbon dioxide, agricultural practices also contribute significantly to global warming by releasing methane and nitrous oxide in the air. A substantial part of methane in the atmosphere comes from flooded rice paddies. Similarly, nitrogen fertilisers are a major source of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere. Elevated levels of carbon dioxide can benefit crops and can be sequestered in carbon sinks. But no such benefits can accrue from methane and nitrous oxide. Moreover, the heat-trapping capacity of methane and nitrous oxide is much more than that of carbon dioxide. While methane has a half-life of 10 years in the atmosphere, nitrous oxide can remain in the atmosphere as long as carbon dioxide. Again, de-nitrification of nitrogenous fertilizers produces dinitrogen oxide which has the potential to destroy the Ozone layer."
