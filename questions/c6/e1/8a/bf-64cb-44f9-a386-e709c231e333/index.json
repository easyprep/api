  "question": "In the later half of 2013, the government had announced a regulation limiting the use of Trans Fatty Acids (TFAs). Why TFAs are used in food items?<br> 1. They increase the shelf life of products<br> 2. They stabilize the flavour and texture of food<br> 3. They raise the HDL and lower the LDL<br> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "<table width=\"100%\"> <tbody> <tr> <td width=\"100%\"><strong>Bits on TFAs</strong> Naturally occurring trans fatty acids, or TFAs, are present in minimal quantity in meat and dairy products from ruminants. Most of the TFAs are created artificially during the process of partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils. TFAs increase the shelf life of products, improve the texture of food and stabilize the flavor. These features have resulted in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils to be used excessively in our food industry in baked foods, like cakes, burgers and biscuit raising the level of LDL, but, unlike saturated fat, it has the additional effect of decreasing levels of HDL.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>"
