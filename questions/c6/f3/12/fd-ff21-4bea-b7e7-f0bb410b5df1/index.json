  "option5": "",
  "answer": "April",
  "explanation": "In wake of increasing and unacceptable levels of anti-Sikh bigotry, US state of New Jersey's State Assembly has declared April as 'Sikh Awareness and Appreciation Month'. During the month of April, efforts will be made to promote public awareness of the Sikh faith, recognise the important contributions of the Sikh community and combat anti-Sikh bigotry. As per US Government data, nearly 60 per cent of Americans know nothing about Sikh religion or its practitioners. After 9/11 terrorist attacks in US, rates of anti-Sikh bigotry rose dramatically as Sikhs in America are often confused for Muslims.",
