  "question": "In context with the 18<sup>th</sup> Non-Alignment Movement Summit held at Baku, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>India is a major non-aligned country.</li>\n<li>China was a co-founder of the non-alignment movement.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nIndia was historically a non-aligned country. However, recently, it has ceased to be one and transformed into a multi-aligned country. The NAM is also seen to have lost its relevance in the present day and age. Because of this, the Indian PM is not to attend the summit in Baku.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nChina was not a co-founder. India, Indonesia, Ghana, Egypt and Yugoslavia were the co-founders of the NAM. The key impetus for the establishment of the NAM was the Asian-African Conference of 1955. NAM was formally established by 25 countries in 1961."
