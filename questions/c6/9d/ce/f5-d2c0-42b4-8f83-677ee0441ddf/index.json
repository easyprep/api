  "question": "What is the India’s position in terms of CO2 emitter in 2017, as per recent study by Global Carbon Project?",
  "option1": "5th",
  "option2": "4th",
  "option3": "6th",
  "option4": "7th",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "4th",
  "explanation": "According to the study by the Global Carbon Project, India is the fourth highest  emitter of CO2 (carbon dioxide) in the world, accounting for 7% of global emissions in 2017.  India\\'s emissions look set to continue their strong growth by an average of 6.3% in 2018, with growth across all fuels -- coal (7.1%), oil (2.9%) and gas (6%). The world’s top 10 Co2 emitters were China, the US, the EU, India, Russia, Japan, Germany, Iran, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. The study said that while China and India still rely heavily on coal, the US and the EU are slowly decarbonising. It further said that India can continue to deploy solar farms, leveraging its leadership of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) to displace coal and clean up its smog-choked cities. The study was recently released on the occasion of the 2018 UN Climate Summit (COP24) in Katowice, Poland. It warned that global emissions of Co2 from fossil fuels and industry are projected to rise for the second consecutive year in 2018 by more than two percent to a new record mainly due to sustained growth in oil and gas use."
