  "explanation": "Taputapuatea marae on Raiatea Island is at the centre of the ‘Polynesian Triangle’, located in French Polynesia, an overseas territory of France, spread in a vast portion of the Pacific Ocean, dotted with islands, and the last part of the globe to be settled by humans. The property includes two forested valleys, a portion of lagoon and coral reef and a strip of the open ocean. At the heart of the property is the Taputapuatea marae complex, a political, ceremonial and funerary centre. It is characterized by several maraes, with different functions. Widespread in Polynesia, the marae were places where the world of the living intersected the world of the ancestors and the gods. Taputapuatea is an exceptional testimony to 1,000 years of mohi civilization."
