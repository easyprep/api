  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe state disaster response fund was constituted under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 for the states. The operation of the SDRFs is under the purview of the ministry of home affairs at the centre. The centre contributes to 90% of the statesâ€™ SDRF.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe DM Act, 2005 had called for creation of DDRFs at the states. However, the creation of these funds was not made mandatory because it may lead to fragmentation of resources in states with inadequate technology cover."
