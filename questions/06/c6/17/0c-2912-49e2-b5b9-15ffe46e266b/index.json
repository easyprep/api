  "question": "“While deltas are mainly formed on eastern coast, lagoons and eastuaries are formed in western coast of India”.Which of the following can be the reason(s) for above statement? <ol> <li>High gradient for west flowing rivers in comparison to east flowing rivers</li> <li>Wider stretch of eastern coastal plains in comparison to west coastal plains</li> </ol> Select the correct option from codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 and 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2",
  "explanation": "Deltas are formed due to accumulation of sediments brought by the rivers.The high gradient of west flowing rivers provides them high velocity due to which rivers carry sediments along with them instead of depositing them.Furthermore, shorter stretch of western coastal plains provides very less space for deposition of sediments hence; ending in forming estuaries and lagoons."
