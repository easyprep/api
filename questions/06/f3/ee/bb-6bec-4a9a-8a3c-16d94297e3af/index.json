  "option2": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Continental Shelf is the extended margin of each continent occupied by relatively shallow seas and gulfs. It is the shallowest part of the ocean showing an average gradient of 1° or even less.<br />The shallowness enables sunlight to penetrate through the water, which encourages the growth of minute plants and other microscopic organisms, thus continental shelves are the richest fishing grounds in the world. <br />The Oceanic Trenches are associated with active volcanoes and strong earthquakes."
