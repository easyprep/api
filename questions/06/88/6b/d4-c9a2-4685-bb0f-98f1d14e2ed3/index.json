  "answer": "1 & 3 Only",
  "explanation": "Scoria cone also known as cinder cone is a volcanic landform. It is formed by a steep conical hill of loose pyroclastic fragments, such as volcanic clinkers, cinders, volcanic ash. A yardang is a rock structure that has been carved by the dual action of wind erosion and wind turbulence. When the vent of a volcano is blocked by solidified lava, the pressure of gases in the interior may blow up the summit of the volcanic cone thereby making a large depression called a caldera."
