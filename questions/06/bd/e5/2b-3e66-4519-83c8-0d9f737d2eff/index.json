  "question": "In context with the recent reports of increased methane emission from the Sudd Wetlands, consider the following statements about this region:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Sudd Wetlands are in Egypt.</li>\n<li>It is located in the Nile River basin.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Sudd Wetlands are found in the South Sudan region in Africa. It is the one of the largest wetlands in the world. Studies show that a significant part of the methane emissions between 2010 and 2016 was from this region. Increase in soil wetness and methane producing microbes are some of the speculated reasons.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Sudd Wetlands are in the basin of the White Nile River. The White Nile is one of the two major tributaries of River Nile, the other one being the Blue Nile River. The wetland is the largest freshwater wetland in the Nile River Basin."
