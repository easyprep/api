  "option1": "Union Public Service Commission",
  "option2": "Joint Consultative Machinery",
  "option3": "Lok Adalats",
  "option4": "Lokayukta / Lok  Pal",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Lok Adalats",
  "explanation": "This is a pure awareness based question. A Whitley Council is a workplace partnership institution in the UK and elsewhere that serves as a forum between employers and employees. During World War I, in 1917, John Henry Whitley chaired a committee which produced a report on the ‘Relations of Employers and Employees’. The smooth running of industry was vital to the war effort, so good industrial relations were a priority. He proposed a system of regular formal consultative meetings between workers and employers, known to this day as Whitley Councils. These are empowered to cover issues of pay and conditions of service. Thus, Whitley Councils are the agencies on reconciliation of the employees and employers. In India, the similar machinery is the Joint Consultative Machinery. The apex body in the Joint Consultative Machinery is the National Council. National Council is headed by Cabinet Secretary."
