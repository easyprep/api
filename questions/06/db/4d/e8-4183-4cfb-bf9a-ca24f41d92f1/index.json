  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "Tropopause refers to the altitude at which the fall in the temperature is stalled. This layer separates the troposphere from the stratosphere (the second layer of the atmosphere). This layer is usually quiet and no major movement of air takes place in it. Its height at Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn is roughly 10 to 15 km, highest at the equator 18 km and at the poles it is about 8 km above the earth. In India, the tropopause is generally at a height of around 16 km. The altitude of the tropopause varies with the variations of sea â€” surface temperature, season, latitude, and weather systems, such as the passage of cyclones and anti-cyclones. So, Tropopause is not a hard lined boundary. The higher is the temperature of the lower layers, the higher is the height of this layer, the layer is lower where there is a cyclone below it. Also note that the tops of cumulus-nimbus clouds often float in his region."
