  "explanation": "Euthanasia is the termination of a very sick person\\'s life in order to relieve them of their suffering. A person who undergoes euthanasia usually has an incurable condition. But there are other instances where some people want their life to be ended.<br />The parliament of New Zealand on November 13, 2019 has voted in favour of a bill to legalize euthanasia. The final decision will rest with voters, who will need to approve the Bill in a referendum next year for it to go into effect. Polls have indicated a majority support the measure. <br />Currently, voluntary euthanasia and/or doctor-assisted suicide is legally available in Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Switzerland, and in six US States (California, Colorado, Montana, Oregon, Vermont and Washington State)."
