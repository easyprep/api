  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The most commonly used script in the inscriptions of the emperor Ashoka (r. 269–232 B.C.E.), the greatest figure in the Maurya dynasty. Ashoka’s empire encompassed all of the subcontinent except the deepest parts of southern India and went west into modern Afghanistan. Brahmi script was used in all regions of the Mauryan empire except in the northwest, where the Kharoshthi script was used. Ashoka’s rock edicts and pillar edicts are the earliest significant Indian written documents and give invaluable information about contemporary social, political, and religious life. Brahmi is the ancestor of the modern Indian scripts, including Devanagari. It is also the ultimate source for all indigenous southeast Asian alphabets, which developed from trade with southern India in the early medieval period. Over the course of time, Brahmi was replaced by later scripts, was forgotten, and became unreadable. Although Ashoka’s inscriptions ensured that Europeans were aware of Brahmi, their content was a mystery until 1837, when James Prinsep deciphered the Brahmi alphabet by working backward from later, known scripts."
