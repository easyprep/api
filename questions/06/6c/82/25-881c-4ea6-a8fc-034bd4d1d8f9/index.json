  "question": "The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) recently tried to move the “No-Confidence Motion” against the NDA government. In this context, consider the following statements: <ol> <li>A no-confidence motion can be introduced only in Lok Sabha and the notice of the same must be supported by at least 100 MPs to be taken up in the House.</li> <li>Nominated members have right to participate in voting during debate on the no-confidence motion</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 Only",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because a no-confidence motion can be introduced only in Lok Sabha and the notice for the same requires to be supported by at least <em>50 MPs and not by 100 MPs</em> to be taken up in the House. <u>Second statement is correct</u>. At the time of the debate in Rajya Sabha on the Constitution Amendment Bill, the purpose of the nomination appeared to be to allow members from a community not adequately represented to be part of the legislature. However, in the enacted law, there was no mention of representation from weaker or inadequately represented sections as a purpose of the nominations. In fact, one member argued that the concept of nomination should not be applicable at all, given the size of a Union Territory, and called for such a clause to be made available only under certain conditions. Another member felt that the union government would use this provision for ulterior motives — he referred to a situation in the Nagpur Corporation where the Congress managed to overturn its minority situation by nominating members to the body. A third member suggested the use of single transferable vote, like in the case of elections to Rajya Sabha, to nominate members. A fourth suggested the use of a Resolution in the Assembly to approve the nomination of members."
