  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "The Indo-Gangetic belt is the world\\'s most extensive expanse of uninterrupted alluvium formed by the deposition of silt by the numerous rivers. The Bangar belt consists of older alluvium and forms the alluvial terrace of the flood plains. In the Gangetic plains, it has a low upland covered by laterite deposits. The Khadar belt lies in lowland areas after the Bangar belt. It is made up of fresh newer alluvium which is deposited by the rivers flowing down the plain."
