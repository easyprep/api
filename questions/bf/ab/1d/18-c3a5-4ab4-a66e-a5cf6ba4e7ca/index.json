  "question": "In recent times, Assam has been reeling under disasters and has historically been disaster prone. In this light, which of the following statements are correct?\n<ol>\n<li>Apart from floods, Assam is prone to earthquakes and falls under seismic zone V.</li>\n<li>Assam has project for mapping the geographical location of all its vital utilities.</li>\n<li>Assam has an early warning system for flood alerts.</li>\n<li>Assam State Disaster Management Authority has a Flood Hazard Atlas.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 and 2",
  "option2": "1, 3 and 4",
  "option3": "1 and 3",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nAssam is prone to different types of hazards like floods, earthquakes, landslides, etc. Assam lies in Seismic zone V. It lies on the Eastern most part of the Indian tectonic plate. Places on the edge of tectonic plate are prone to earthquakes. Assam experiences moderate to very high intensity quakes. Eg: 1897 saw an 8.7 magnitude quake in Assam.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nGIS Mapping of Utilities and Infrastructure for Assam is a project undertaken by the state disaster management authority to identify key utilities and infrastructure in terms of geographical coordinates. In times of disaster, the information will aid key decisions of the administration. The project identifies 18 utilities- for use as shelter homes (hospitals, government buildings, educational centres, etc), safe grounds etc.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nAssamâ€™s FLEW/ Flood Early Warning System is the first of its kind in the country. It was developed by North Eastern Space Application System (NESAC). Apart from early warning, it also provides reports on embankments, joint participation of stakeholders for improvement, rainfall prediction, and use of models and simulations to predict inundation.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is correct:\nAssam has a Flood Hazard Map. It was created by the joint effort of the state disaster management authority and National remote sensing centre of Hyderabad. The map was derived from satellite datasets (from over a period of a decade) from both Indian and foreign satellites. The map also shows rail lines and roadways to indicate their frequency of subjection to floods. The map has five categories- from very low to very high hazard zones."
