  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Eritrea",
  "explanation": "Gulf of Zula, also known as Annesley Bay, is a body of water located on the coast of Eritrea facing the Red Sea. The coast of the gulf is fringed with mangroves on either side of the mouth of the river. The egyptologist Henry Salt identified Zula as the ancient archaeological site of Adulis. The Gulf of Zula is a deep water bay, formed as part of the complex rifting system that occurred in these parts where three tectonic plates meet. The rift continues inland to the Danakil Depression, a sandy plain lying 120 m below sea level. The gulf also marks the territorial division between the Saho people and the Afar people."
