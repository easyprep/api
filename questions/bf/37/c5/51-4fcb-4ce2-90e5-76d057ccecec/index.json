  "question": "In context of the recent reports of success of SRI method used by Thai farmers, consider the following statements about the System of Rice Intensification method:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It involves planting of seedlings close together to increase yield in an area.</li>\r\n<li>SRI makes use of moist fields as opposed to flooded fields for paddy cultivation.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe System of Rice Intensification involves the planting of seedling in a spread out manner. The wide spacing is to allow more nutrients and light to be available to each plant. The system was developed by Henri de Laulaine in 1980.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe SRI method uses lesser water than traditional paddy cultivation which resorts to flooding the field. The SRI method is based on moist soil rather than saturated soil. This improves population of aerobic microbes that act as natural fertiliser and also promotes root growth."
