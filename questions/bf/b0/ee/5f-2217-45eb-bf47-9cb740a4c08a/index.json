  "explanation": "The World Elephant Day (WED) is observed every year on 12th of August to raise awareness of the worsening plight of Asian and African elephants. The day also observed to bring the world together to help protect & honour these gentle giants and to spread awareness about the critical threats they are facing. Elephant is also the National Heritage Animal of India. However, the state of this majestic animal is becoming pitiable due to man’s conflict with the wild. African elephants are listed as “Vulnerable” and Asian elephants as “Endangered” on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Their numbers are dwindling as poachers target them for their ivory. Habitat loss is another reason for their dwindling numbers."
