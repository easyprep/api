  "question": "Which of the following is correct about EMF of a cell?",
  "option1": "it is the potential difference between the electrodes when current is flowing in the cell",
  "option2": "it is the drift velocity of the electrons when there is no current in the cell",
  "option3": "it is the potential difference between the electrodes when there is no current in the cell",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "it is the potential difference between the electrodes when there is no current in the cell",
  "explanation": "Emf is defined as the potential difference between electrodes when there is no current in the cell(cell is in open circuit)."
