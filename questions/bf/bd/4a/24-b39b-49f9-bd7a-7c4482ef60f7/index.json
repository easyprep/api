  "question": "The equation of motion 'v = u +at' can be applied in which of the following cases?",
  "option1": "simple harmonic motion",
  "option2": "circular motion",
  "option3": "when acceleration is constant",
  "option4": "Both b and c",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "when acceleration is constant",
  "explanation": "The equation of motion 'v = u +at' can be applied only when the acceleration is constant. It cannot be applied in the cases of simple harmonic motion and circular motion."
