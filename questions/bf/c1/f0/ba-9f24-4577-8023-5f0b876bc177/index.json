  "question": "In context with the recent discussions about negative interest rates, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Negative interest rates are used to discourage savings.</li>\n<li>Negative interest rates reflect a strong economic growth prospect.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nNegative interest rates are used to encourage people to spend more and reduce the tendency to save money. This is because a saver needs to pay the bank to keep money in his/ her savings account. This is a practice prevalent in countries like Sweden, Japan, etc.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nNegative interest rates are indicative of a weak economic growth prospect. A major drawback of using negative interest rates is that it may lead to a government borrowing more than it can pay back. The negative interest rate policy has not encouraged borrowing in countries like Japan and Europe according to studies.\n&nbsp;"
