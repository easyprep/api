  "question": "In context with the release of the Global Wealth Report, consider the following statements about wealth distribution:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>US has the most people in the top 10% of the global wealth distribution.</li>\n<li>Most of the global wealth is owned by the richest 10% at the top.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Global Wealth Report showed that China is the country with the most people in the top 10% of global wealth distribution. China has displaced USA from this position. China showed a 2.6% change in wealth per adult in 2018 to 2019.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nMost of the global wealth is owned by the richest 10% of the world. This is 82% of the total global wealth. The top 1% alone holds about 44% of the global wealth. The bottom 50% of the population accounts for less than 1% of the global wealth."
