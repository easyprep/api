  "answer": "Only 3 is correct",
  "explanation": "Offshore oil and gas production is more challenging than land-based installations due to the remote and harsher environment. Much of the innovation in the offshore petroleum sector concerns overcoming these challenges, including the need to provide very large production facilities. The first two statements are incorrect . The third statement is correct because that is one of the reasons. Even, now the shallow oil off shore deposits are mostly taken/exploited so people are having to go to deeper water."
