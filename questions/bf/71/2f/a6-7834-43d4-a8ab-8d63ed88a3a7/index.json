  "question": "In an atom, the order of filling up of the orbitals is governed by which of the following principles?",
  "option1": "Aufbau principle",
  "option2": "Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle",
  "option3": "Hund’s rule",
  "option4": "Pauli’s exclusion principle",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Aufbau principle",
  "explanation": "Aufbau principle states that \\'in the ground state of the atom, the orbitals are filled in order of their increasing energies, starting with the orbital of lowest energy.\\' The word aufbau is German word which means building up. The increasing order of energy and hence that of filling of orbitals is as follows: 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p."
