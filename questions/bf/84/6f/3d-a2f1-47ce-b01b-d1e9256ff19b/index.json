  "answer": "United States of America and Haiti",
  "explanation": "The United States of America and Haiti are the two countries that are involved in the Navassa Island territorial dispute. Navassa Island is a small uninhabited island in the Caribbean Sea. It is subject to an ongoing territorial dispute between Haiti and the United States, which administers the island through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The U.S. has claimed the island since 1857, based on the Guano Islands Act of 1856. Haiti's claim over Navassa goes back to the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697 that established French possessions in mainland Hispaniola, that were transferred from Spain by the treaty as well as other specifically named nearby islands.",
