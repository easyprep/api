  "question": "A car travels at a speed of 60 km/hr and covers a particular distance in one hour. How long will it take for another car to cover the same distance at 40 km/hr?",
  "option1": "$latex 1\\ hours$",
  "option2": "$latex \\frac{3}{2}\\ hours&s=1$",
  "option3": "$latex 2\\ hours$",
  "option4": "$latex \\frac{5}{2}\\ hours&s=1$",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "$latex \\frac{3}{2}\\ hours&s=1$",
  "explanation": "Distance = Speed $latex \\\\times$ Time = 60 km\r\nTime taken at 40 km/hr $latex = \\\\frac{60}{40} = \\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\ hours&s=1$\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer"
