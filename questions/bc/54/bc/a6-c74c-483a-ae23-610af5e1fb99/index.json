  "question": "The Protection of Human rights (Amendment) bill, 2019 was passed in the Rajya Sabha. In this context, which of the following statements are correct?\n<ol>\n<li>Delhi will get its own Human Rights Commission under this bill.</li>\n<li>Not only a former CJI but even a former Chief Justice from HC can be considered for the post on NHRC chairman under this bill.</li>\n<li>The bill increases the tenure of NHRC chairpersons from 3 years to 5 years.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "All of the above",
  "option2": "Only 3",
  "option3": "1 and 3",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe issues related to human rights violation in Delhi will be dealt with the National Human Rights Commission. The bill may confer the human rights functions to be discharged in UTs to SHRCs. SHRC/ state human rights commissions are largely for dealing with state-wise issues.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe bill provides that the chairperson of NHRC could be selected if the person had been a former judge of the SC. Initially, the 1993 act, that this bill amends, provides that only a former CJI could be made the NHRC chairperson. The question still remains if the post could be given to a former SC judge by surpassing a former CJI.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe bill reduced the tenure of the NHRC chairperson from the earlier 5 years to 3 years. The reduction of tenure also applies to the SHRC chairpersons. It also provides for reappointments for 5 year period until the person reaches the age of 70. The bill removes the 5 year limit set for reappointment.\n&nbsp;"
