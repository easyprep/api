  "answer": "Only 1, 2 & 4",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct.<br />Early Congress was a mighty nationalizer in words of P. Ananda Charlu. One of the basic aims were fuller development and consolidation of those sentiments of national unity and mobilize and educate people on all India basis.<br />Second statement is also correct.<br />Although at that time there was no ready-made anti-colonial understanding or ideology and they had to develop their own anti-colonial ideology on the basis of a concrete study of the reality and of their own practice. But, apart from laying the foundations of a secular and democratic national movement, the aims were to politicize and politically educate the people, to form the headquarters of the movement, that is, to form an all-India leadership group, and to develop and propagate an anti-colonial nationalist ideology.<br />Thr third statement is not correct.<br />Congress was not to take up questions of social reform. At its second session, the President of the Congress, Dadabhai Naoroji, laid down this rule and said that ‘A National Congress must confine itself to questions in which the entire nation has a direct participation.’ Congress was, therefore, not the right place to discuss social reforms. ‘We are met together,’ he said, ‘as a political body to represent to our rulers our political aspiration.<br />Fourth statements is correct."
