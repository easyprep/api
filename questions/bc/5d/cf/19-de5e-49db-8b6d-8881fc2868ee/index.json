  "question": "In computing, 1 nibble = ?",
  "option1": "4 Bits",
  "option2": "4 Bytes",
  "option3": "8 Bytes",
  "option4": "8 Kilo Bytes",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "4 Bits",
  "explanation": "In computing, a nibble (often nybble or even nyble to simulate the spelling of byte) is a four-bit aggregation, or half an octet. As a nibble contains 4 bits, there are sixteen possible values, so a nibble corresponds to a single hexadecimal digit (thus, it is often referred to as a “hex digit” or “hexit”)."
