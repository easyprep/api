  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Abhirup Bhattacharya",
  "explanation": "The book \\\"Winning Like Sourav: Think &amp; Succeed Like Ganguly\\\" has been authored by Abhirup Bhattacharya. As per the book, Ganguly\\'s mantra was simple: If he believed that a youngster was talented, he would have enough opportunities to prove his worth. This provided a much-needed calmer atmosphere for the young player as it was certain that he will not be dropped after one failure. Ganguly is credited with nurturing players such as Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif, Zaheer Khan, Virender Sehwag, Harbhajan Singh and building concept of \\'Team India\\' and \\'Men in Blue\\'. It was Sourav Ganguly\\'s gamble on talented youngsters waiting for the opportunity that helped India from losing one of its greatest cricketers of all times - Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Ganguly had taken over the reins of the Indian cricket team from Sachin Tendulkar after the match-fixing exposes in 2000. Bhattacharya says the book, replete with statistics and anecdotes, is not a biography but attempts at drawing management lessons and inspiration from the life of an exemplary skipper like Ganguly."
