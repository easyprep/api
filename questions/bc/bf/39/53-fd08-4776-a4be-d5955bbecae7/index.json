  "option1": "2 and 3",
  "option2": "1 and 2",
  "option3": "2 only",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nIndia does not have a specific act to deal with illegal immigration. The problem is dealt with by the Foreigners act, 1946. The act gives the power to centre to deport such people. The states are concerned with setting up of the detention centres outside the jails. The number of centres and location are decided by the state governments. They do not need permission from the Centre’s MHA.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nAssam has the largest number of detention centres in India (6 centres). The detention centres are not the same as prisons but they were being treated so earlier. This was due to lack of solid guidelines. The MHA had issued a set of guidelines ‘Model Detention Centre Manual’ to help with its management.\n<strong>Statement 3</strong> is incorrect:\nThe MHA guidelines provide that the detention centre’s children may be educated at local schools. The manual also called for setting up of crèche at these centres. It also call for facilities for nursing mothers, transgender, etc. It also gives provision against separation of families in these centres."
