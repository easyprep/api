  "question": "Which of the following elements are found in DNA?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Oxygen</li>\r\n<li>Nitrogen</li>\r\n<li>Sulphur</li>\r\n<li>Phosphorus</li>\r\n<li>Carbon</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1, 2, 3 & 5",
  "option2": "Only 1, 2, 4 & 5",
  "option3": "Only 1, 2 & 5",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3, 4 & 5",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1, 2, 4 & 5",
  "explanation": "This question is based on difference between DNA and Proteins. DNA does not contain sulfur; proteins do. DNA consists of thesugar deoxyribose, which contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. DNA also contains phosphates, which contain phosphorous and oxygen. DNA also contains nitrogenous bases, which contain nitrogen. This difference in composition between DNA and proteins was the basis of the experiment done by Hershey and Chase."
