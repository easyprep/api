  "question": "Which institute develops aircraft that can fold wings mid-flight?",
  "option1": "NASA",
  "option2": "SPIC",
  "option3": "ISRO",
  "option4": "ISIR",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "NASA",
  "explanation": "NASA successfully applied a new technology that allows aircraft to fold their wings between zero and 70 degrees while inflight. Built from a shape memory alloy, the system operates without a hydraulic system, reducing the wing weight by up to 80%. The technology's potential aerodynamic benefit includes increased controllability, which may result in a more fuel-efficient aircraft.",
