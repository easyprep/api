  "question": "Which among the following is/are conditional for the formation of Coral Reefs?<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The temperature of the water should be below 20째C.</li>\r\n<li>Shallow water having a depth less than 50 m.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "Growth conditions for Coral Reefs:<br />The temperature of the water should not be below 20째C. The most favourable temperature for the growth of the coral reefs is between 23째C to 25째C.<br />Corals can survive only under saline conditions with an average salinity between 27% to 40%.<br />Coral reefs grow better in shallow water having a depth less than 50 m. The depth of the water should not exceed 200m."
