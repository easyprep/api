  "answer": "NASA",
  "explanation": "NASA has scheduled to launch the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) in the middle of 2020. WFIRST has a 300-megapixel Wide Field Instrument. This will capture the sky area 100 times larger than the previous Hubble telescope. WFIRST will study about dark energy. The Wide Field Instrument will also enable WFIRST to measure matter in hundreds of millions of distant galaxies through a phenomenon stated in Einstein's relativity theory. WFIRST will picture how matter is structured throughout the universe. This will help scientists to test the governing physics of the assembly of universe.",
