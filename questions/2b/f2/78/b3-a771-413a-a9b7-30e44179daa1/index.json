  "question": "The Union Government has banned which antibiotic in animal food industry?",
  "option1": "Biaxin",
  "option2": "Keflex",
  "option3": "Colistin",
  "option4": "Doxycycline",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Colistin",
  "explanation": "In a bid to preserve the drugâ€™s efficacy in humans, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has banned the manufacture, sale and distribution of Colistin and its formulations for food-producing animals, poultry, aqua farming and animal feed supplements. The ban has been imposed under provisions of section 26A of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940 and a notification in this regard has been issued by the Centre. According to a ministry official, the antibiotic is being used as a last resort for treatment of patients suffering from infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria. But the drug is highly misused in poultry industry as a growth promoter for prophylactic purpose."
