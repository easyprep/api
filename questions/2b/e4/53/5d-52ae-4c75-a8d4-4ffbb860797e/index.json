  "option3": "Huge rise in the vehicular population",
  "option4": "Too much dependence on fossil fuels like coal-fired power plants",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Practice of crop stubble burning in neighboring states",
  "explanation": "Satellite images from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) over Punjab and Haryana in the last few weeks reveal the fact that practice of crop stubble burning in the two states at an extensive level is the major reason behind choking the Delhi city. Stubble burning also releases a variety of harmful chemicals like polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) that have toxicological effects. The crop when burnt also release into air fine particulate matter which when coupled with western winds during winter, reach Delhi to choke the city. Punjab and Haryana have two main growing seasons: one from May to September (Kharif) and another from November to April (Rabi). Punjab and Haryana on account of high quality irrigation facility practice farming on large scale. As soon as the Kharif crops are reaped, the farmers simply burn leftover plant debris, especially rice stubble to prepare the field for Rabi season."
