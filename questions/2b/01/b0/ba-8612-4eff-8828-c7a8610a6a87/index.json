  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong> Pangolins are also known as Scaly Anteaters. They are the most trafficked animals in the wild. They are listed under Appendix I of the CITES- i.e. their trade is banned except in exceptional cases. They are especially traded in China and Vietnam for their meat. <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong> Pangolins are found throughout India in a variety of habitats ranging from deserts and grasslands to mountain forests. They have a scaly armour made of keratin. They tend to roll up during predator attacks. They are insectivorous and feed on termites and ants. <strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong> The animal is protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The Indian Pangolin is listed as an endangered species by IUCN. In India, they face threat from the demand for their meat and scales in traditional medicines. They reproduce only once a year and produces a single offspring. Hence illegal trade affects it adversely."
