  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 only",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 only",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe concept was formulated by Deng Xiaoping- a leader of PRC in 1980s. It was to provide for a separate economic and administrative system for Macau and Hong Kong while PRC continues its own socialist system. But the concept has also been proposed for other countries like the Israel- Palestine duo, Northern Ireland, Korean peninsula etc.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Umbrella movement was organised in 2014 in Hong Kong as a protest against the proposal for pre-screening of candidates for chief executive’s election. It was a pro-democracy movement- similar to the current protest. When Hong Kong was returned by Britain to China, it was provided the right to freely elect its own leaders. However, disputes have often arisen because of China eroding its autonomy.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nMacau is also under the one country, two system principle. It was returned to China in 1999. Macau has its own economic system (capitalistic) and legal system. Its currency is Pataca. Chinese Renminbi is not legal tender in this territory."
