  "question": "Consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) was launched from Rabi 1999-2000 replacing the erstwhile Comprehensive Crop Insurance Scheme (CCIS)</li>\r\n<li>Only those crops which have adequate past data are included in the NAIS</li>\r\n<li>The NAIS is applicable only in defined areas for each notified crop</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is/ are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3 are correct",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are correct",
  "explanation": "The first statement is correct, we all know about this. NIAS has covered all the food crops (cereals, millets and pulses), oilseeds and annual commercial/horticultural crops, in respect of which past yield data is available for adequate number of years. This is required for the insurance purpose. The crops which are not under cover of the scheme are stipulated to be placed under insurance cover in due course of time subject to availability of past yield data.\r\nThe third statement is also correct and scheme operates on the basis of ‘Area Approach’ i.e. defined areas for each notified crop. The premium rates are 3.5% of sum insured for bajra and oilseeds, 2.5% for other Kharif crops, 1.5 per cent for wheat, and 2 per cent for other Rabi crops. Please note that 25 states and 2 Uts viz, Puducherry and A&amp;N Islands are under this scheme as of now."
