  "option4": "3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2, 3, 4 & 5",
  "explanation": "Supreme Court is the final interpreter of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has declared that hoisting tricolour is a fundamental right of the citizens under Article 19(1) A of the Constitution, provided that the activity does not undermine the dignity of the tricolour. Similarly, Supreme Court ruled that privacy is a fundamental right of the citizens because it is an integral part of Right to Life and Personal Liberty guaranteed in Article 21 of the Constitution. To contest election or vote in any election is a constitutional right. Right to property is a constitutional right under Article 300-A. Right to property was removed from the list of Fundamental Rights via the Constitution 44th Amendment Act, 1978. Right to Information is a part of fundamental rights under Article 19(1) of the Constitution. Supreme Court has also ruled that the right to peaceful protest is a fundamental right guaranteed in the Constitution, and such rights can be traced under Articles 19(1) (a), 19(1) (b) and 19(1) (c) of the Constitution."
