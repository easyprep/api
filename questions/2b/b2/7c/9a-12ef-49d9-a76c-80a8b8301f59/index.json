  "option1": "Only 2",
  "option2": "Only 3",
  "option3": "1 and 3",
  "option4": "2 and 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nMangamaripeta rock formation is one of the two such arched sites. It is still evolving due to natural forces. The formation is said to have started forming about 10,000 years ago. It is yet to receive the geo-heritage tag. Geo-heritage site tag is conferred when it possesses 3 criteria: it is of scientific interest, of educational value and has aesthetic value.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nErramatti Dibbalu is a national Geo-heritage site in Vizag. It is a red sand dune formation. It is said to be 20,000 years old and the tagging was done in 2014 with the aid of Geological survey of India. It is a protected site under the government.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nAraku volcanic ash deposit is found in the Eastern Ghats. The deposit is 70cm thick and composed of ash from an ancient volcanic eruption of Mt. Toba, which is in Indonesia. The deposit is 75,000 years old and of significant interest to earth sciences. Eastern Ghats is a national geo-heritage site.\n&nbsp;"
