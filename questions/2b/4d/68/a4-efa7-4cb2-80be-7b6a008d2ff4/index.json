  "explanation": "• The Florida Current is a thermal ocean current that flows from the Straits of Florida around the Florida Peninsula and along the southeastern coast of the United States before joining the Gulf Stream Current near Cape Hatteras. Its contributing currents are the Loop Current and the Antilles Current.<br />• The Benguela Current is a cold, wide current that flows northwards along the west coast of southern Africa. It is an Eastern Boundary Current and forms the eastern flank of the South Atlantic Gyre The ocean current “begins” roughly where the eastward-flowing South Atlantic Current swings northward at the Agulhas.<br />• The Peruvian Current, also called the Humboldt Current, is a cold, low-salinity ocean current that flows north along the western coast of South America. It is an eastern boundary current flowing in the direction of the equator, and extends 500–1,000 km (310–620 mi) offshore.<br />• The Kuroshio a warm northeasterly ocean current off the coast of JAPAN. This current is also called the gulf stream of the Pacific or Japan Current. Kuroshio means “the black stream” in Japanese, named after the deep ultramarine color of the high salinity water, which is found flowing north of the current\\'s axis."
