  "question": "The plant hormone that plays important role in establishing dormancy in seeds is __?",
  "option1": "Ethylene",
  "option2": "Gibberlic acid",
  "option3": "Abcisic Acid",
  "option4": "Auxin",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Abcisic Acid",
  "explanation": "Seeds are not only important agents of reproduction and dispersal, but they are also essential to the survival of annual and biennial plants. These angiosperms die after flowering and seed formation is complete. ABA is essential for seed maturation and also enforces a period of seed dormancy. As it is important the seeds not germinate prematurely during unseasonably mild conditions prior to the onset of winter or a dry season. ABA in the seed enforces this dormancy. Not until the seed has been exposed to a prolonged cold spell and/or sufficient water to support germination is dormancy lifted."
