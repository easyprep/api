Amongst its early leaders was the prominent nationalist and educationalist Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, who founded the Benaras Hindu University, and the Punjabi populist Lala Lajpat Rai. Banaras Hindu University was established in 1915. Malviya was instrumental in the coming together of Hindu Mahasabha and Arya Samaj in 1923 to make common cause on issues like cow slaughter and reconversion. He was also closely associated with bodies like Pragya Hindu Samaj, Bharat Dharma Mahamandal and Sanatana Dharma Mahasabha."
