  "answer": "Germany",
  "explanation": "Germany's art school movement was \"Bauhaus Art\". The Staatliches Bauhaus, commonly known as the Bauhaus, was a German art school operational from 1919 to 1933 that combined crafts and the fine arts. The school became famous for its approach to design, which attempted to unify the principles of mass production with individual artistic vision and strove to combine aesthetics with everyday function. The Bauhaus was founded by architect Walter Gropius in Weimar. It was grounded in the idea of creating a \"comprehensive artwork\" in which all the arts would eventually be brought together. The Bauhaus style later became one of the most influential currents in modern design, modernist architecture and art, design, and architectural education."
