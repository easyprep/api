  "answer": "5th Schedule",
  "explanation": "The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has given approval for the inclusion of tribal-dominated Scheduled Areas of Rajasthan under Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of India by rescinding the Constitution Order (C.O.)114 dated 12th February 1981 and promulgation of a new Constitution Order. With this, the Scheduled Tribes (ST) residing in Banswara, Dungarpur, Pratapgarh, and partial areas of Udaipur, Rajsamand, Chittorgarh, Pali and Sirohi districts of Rajasthan will get benefits of protective measures available under the 5th Schedule to the Constitution of India. No additional funds are required as to be expended on account of declaration of scheduled areas. This will be part of Tribal sub-plan ( renamed as Tribal Sub-Scheme) within existing schemes of central and the state government for more focused attention in scheduled areas for effecting speedy development."
