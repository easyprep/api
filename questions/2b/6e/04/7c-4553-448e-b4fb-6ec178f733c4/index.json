  "question": "Which among the following is homologous to a human arm?",
  "option1": "Wing of an insect",
  "option2": "Leg of a lobster",
  "option3": "Lateral Fin of a whale",
  "option4": "Front leg of a reptile",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Lateral Fin of a whale",
  "explanation": "The lateral fin of the whale consists of the same bones as a human’s arm, the radius, ulna, and humerus. These structures are considered to be homologous because the underlying structure is similar and, therefore, humans and whales share a common ancestor. The lobster’s leg, the reptile’s front leg, and the insect’s wing are analogous to the human’s arm. They have a common function but no common structure, and they do not share a common ancestor."
