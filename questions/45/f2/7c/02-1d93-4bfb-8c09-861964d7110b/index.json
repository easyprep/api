  "answer": "The region between latitudes 40° and 50°S, where the prevailing westerly winds blow over the open oceans with great regularity and strength",
  "explanation": "The <em>Roaring Forties</em> are strong westerly winds found in the Southern Hemisphere, generally between the latitudes of 40 and 50 degrees. The strong west-to-east air currents are caused by the combination of air being displaced from the Equator towards the South Pole, the Earth\\'s rotation, and the scarcity of landmasses to serve as windbreaks."
