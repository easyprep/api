  "answer": 0.072,
  "explanation": "As per latest biannual World Economic Outlook (WEO) report, International Monetary Fund (IMF) has increased India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate estimate for FY 17 (2016-17) to 6.8%, from 6.6% estimated in January 2017.  As per WEO,  IMF has also retained India’s  GDP growth projection of 7.2% for FY 18 and 7.7% for FY19 because of the temporary negative consumption shock induced by cash shortages and payment disruptions from the recent currency exchange initiative.  According to WEO, the global economy is expected to do better with 3.5% growth in 2017 against 3.1% in 2016 on the back of better growth in the US and the emerging market pack, but Euro zone is likely to continue to grow at current pace."
