  "option2": 0.1,
  "option3": 0.06,
  "option4": 0.08,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 0.05,
  "explanation": "If rate of interest be R% p.a. then, \r\n$latex S.I. = \\\\frac{Principal\\\\times Time\\\\times Rate}{100}&s=1$\r\n$latex \\\\therefore \\\\frac{6000\\\\times 2\\\\times R}{100}+\\\\frac{1500\\\\times 4\\\\times R}{100}=900&s=1$\r\n$latex =>120R+60R=900$\r\n$latex =>180R=900$\r\n$latex =>R=\\\\frac{900}{180}=&s=1$ 5%\r\nHence option [A] is the right answer"
