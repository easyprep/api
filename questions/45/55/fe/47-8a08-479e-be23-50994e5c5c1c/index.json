  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "The first statement need knowledge and second statement needs some commonsense. Beautiful rainbows, which sometimes arch across the sky during rain showers, do not appear during snow showers. This is because a snowflake has a different shape than a raindrop. When raindrops fall from the sky, they are round like tiny balls. To form a rainbow, the sun must shine on the raindrops. When a ray of sunlight reaches a raindrop, some of the light enters the drop and refracts. This means that the ray bends at the surface of the drop and changes its direction. Different colors of light refract in slightly different directions. This is how the white sunlight, which is really a combination of red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet light, gets separated into different colors. Then each colored ray of light takes its own path inside the raindrop and exits in a different direction.<br> Therefore, when you look up at the rain in the sky, each color of light comes at you from a different direction, and you see a rainbow. In contrast to the simple round shape of raindrops, snowflakes are six-sided and flat. When sunlight shines on snowflakes tumbling and falling through the air, the many different surfaces of the snowflakes cause the light to be refracted and reflected in many different directions, and the light is too scattered to form a rainbow. However, in special situations snowflakes can create interesting and beautiful displays with sunlight. Parahelia, sometimes called &#8220;mock suns&#8221; or &#8220;sun dogs,&#8221; are bright spots that appear to the left and right of the sun. They form when rays of sunlight refract through thin plate-like snowflakes that are falling flat through calm air. Often each bright spot has a reddish side and a bluish side.<br> The rainbow is not located at a specific distance, but comes from any water droplets viewed from a certain angle relative to the Sun&#8217;s rays. Thus, a rainbow is not a physical object, and cannot be physically approached. Indeed, it is impossible for an observer to manoeuvre to see any rainbow from water droplets at any angle other than the customary one of 42 degrees from the direction opposite the Sun. Even if an observer sees another observer who seems &#8220;under&#8221; or &#8220;at the end&#8221; of a rainbow, the second observer will see a different rainbow further off-yet, at the same angle as seen by the first observer."
