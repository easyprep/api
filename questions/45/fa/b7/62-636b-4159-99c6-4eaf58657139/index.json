  "question": "Which of the following is / are correct statements with respect to the so called “pink noise”?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It is a sound that has equal energy for each frequency.</li>\r\n<li>It is primarily consisted of low frequency sounds.</li>\r\n<li>Heartbeat produces pink noise.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Pink noise, also known as 1/f noise, is a sound that has equal energy in all octaves. It primarily consists of low frequency sounds. Due to practical constraints, pink noise can be produced only over a certain range of frequencies and occurs naturally. Astronauts listening to electromagnetic radiation in outer space have noted it being emitted from certain stars. In biology, it is produced by the heartbeat and has shown up in DNA sequence statistics."
