  "answer": "Cricket",
  "explanation": "Mohit Ahlawat (21) from Delhi has become the first batsman in the world to score a triple century in a T20 match at a level. He achieved this feat in a local T20 tournament at Delhi’s Lalita Park, playing for Maavi XI against Friend’s XI. Mohit’s unbeaten 300 run innings came off just 72 balls and was laced with a staggering 39 sixes and 14 boundaries. In professional cricket, the highest individual score in T20 cricket belongs to Chris Gayle, who made 175 runs in just 66 balls for Royal Challengers Bangalore. The highest individual in international cricket is 156 that Aaron Finch smashed in 63 balls for Australia against England."
