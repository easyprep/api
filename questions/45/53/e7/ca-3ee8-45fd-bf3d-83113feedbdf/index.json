  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe 2019 bill has been passed in both houses and will put India on the map as an international arbitration centre. It will also reduce the high pendency faced by the judiciary. This will be achieved by the Arbitration Council of India, to be setup by the bill. The ACI will promote alternative dispute resolutions like conciliation, mediation etc.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe chairperson of the ACI is to be appointed by the government in consultation with the CJI. The chairperson is to be a judge of a High Court or Supreme Court, Chief Justice of a High Court or an eminent person possessing special knowledge in the arbitration field.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nA major benefit of the ACI is the reduction in time for wrapping up of disputes. The bill mandates that the statement of claim and defence must be filled within 6 months of date of receiving the appointment notice by the arbitrator. This will effectively shift the time spent by parties for filing the plea to the actual arbitration process."
