Assam State Cabinet had approved these RoW guidelines on January 28, 2018, and State Chief Secretary V K Pipersenia held a meeting with telecom service providers and other stakeholders on February 12, 2018 to review the current mobile and internet connectivity status. These guidelines will regulate the establishment of underground and overground telecom infrastructure in Assam. The entire process of seeking Government approval and required rights will be made online within a period of one year and all operators will have to compulsorily register in the ease of doing business portal of the Assam government.",
