  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The soil is acidic in nature due to the falling pine needles; the forest floor has only lichens and some moss growing on it. Leaching of soils results in infertility of soil as minerals are washed away in the lower horizons.&nbsp;This leaching of the minerals makes them inaccessible to the tree roots."
