  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Xanthan gum is the most versatile elastic thickener and easy-to-use hydrocolloid. It can be used in hot or cold applications, and is extremely powerful in small quantities. Xanthan gum is increasingly been used as a less expensive alternative to guar gum in many food-based applications. It has seen growing use by the oil industry to thicken drilling mud, enabling the more efficient extraction of crude oil and natural gas. In recent years, Guar Gum trade in India has suffered a setback due to its replacement by Xanthan Gum for many activities."
