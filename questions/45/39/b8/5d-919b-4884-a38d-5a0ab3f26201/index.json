  "question": "With reference to the recent discovery about the Denisovans, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The Denisovans existed in the Siberian region.</li>\n<li>The Denisovan lineage developed into the modern Homo sapiens.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nDenisovans are ancient forerunners of the Homo genus and were related to the Neanderthals. They existed in the Denisovan caves in Siberia from 200,000 years ago to 50,000 years. The scientists have simulated their skull using data from DNA that was derived from Denisovan cave samples.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe lineage of the Denisovians and Neanderthals is different from the modern manâ€™s lineage. The lines separated about 600,000 to 744,000 years ago. However, some studies reported possible inter-breeding among the lines. Some of their genetic markers have been found in some populations."
