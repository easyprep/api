  "question": "With reference to the recent discussions about extra-ocular vision in red brittle star or Ophicoma wendteii, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It is the ability to see without eyes.</li>\r\n<li>It is the only species with extra-ocular vision.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nExtra- ocular vision refers to the ability to resolve scenes without the use of eyes. Such organisms are capable of ‘seeing’ or detecting light with the help of photoreceptor cells on their body. The brittle star, a type of starfish, has its body covered in such light sensing cells that give the organism visual stimuli about its surroundings.\r\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe red brittle star is only the second known organism with extra- ocular vision. These starfishes live in the coral reefs of Caribbean Sea. They are noted for their ability to change color from red in the daytime to beige at nights. Sea urchins are also known to possess extra- ocular vision. \r\n&nbsp;"
