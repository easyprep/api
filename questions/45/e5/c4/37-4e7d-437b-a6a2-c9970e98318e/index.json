  "question": "What do we call the molecular orbital obtained by subtraction of atomic orbitals?",
  "option1": "Bonding orbital",
  "option2": "Anti-bonding orbital",
  "option3": "Lateral orbital",
  "option4": "Sub-orbital",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Anti-bonding orbital",
  "explanation": "The molecular orbital obtained by the addition of atomic orbitals is of lower energy than that of the atomic orbitals and is called a bonding orbital. The orbital obtained by subtraction of atomic orbitals is of higher energy and is called an anti-bonding orbital."
