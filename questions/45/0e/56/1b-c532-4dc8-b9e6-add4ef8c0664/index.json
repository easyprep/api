  "question": "Which of the following is / are correct statements?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>When glass rod is rubbed with silk, negative charge develops on silk</li>\r\n<li>When Ebonite rod is rubbed with fur, negative charge develops on fur</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, a positive charge develops on the glass rod and a negative charge is developed on silk. The glass rod transfers its electrons to the silk when it is rubbed with silk. Thus, glass rod has less number of electrons than the number of protons in the nucleus. Thus, on the whole, the glass rod gets positively charged. When an ebonite rod is rubbed with fur, a negative charge develops on ebonite rod and a positive charge develops on fur. Ebonite rod gains electrons from the fur when it is rubbed with fur. Thus ebonite has more negative charges as compared to positive charges in the nucleus. Thus, on the whole, ebonite rod gets negatively charged."
