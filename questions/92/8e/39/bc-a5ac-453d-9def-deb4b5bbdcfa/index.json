  "question": "Which of the following factors are responsible for coral bleaching?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Increased or reduced water temperature</li>\r\n<li>Over fishing</li>\r\n<li>Increased solar irradiance</li>\r\n<li>Changes in salinity</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1, 2 & 4",
  "option2": "Only 1, 3 & 4",
  "option3": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "All the above factors are responsible for coral beaching. Elevated sea temperatures are the biggest culprits when it comes to coral bleaching. El Ni√±o also plays a role in heating up ocean waters. Over fishing results in increase in zooplanktons which results in low availability of oxygen leads to death of corals. Extra-bright sunlight, especially when combined with the aforementioned extra-warm seawater another important cause of coral bleaching."
