  "explanation": "Recently, India and France have signed an agreement on the TRISHNA Satellite Programme. The programme is meant for eco-system stress and water use monitoring. This is the third such agreement. India has already signed two such agreements with France for collaborative satellite programmes viz. Megha-Tropiques and SARAL-AltiKa. Megha-Tropiques aims for studying the water cycle and energy exchanges in the tropics. The SARAL mission results from the common interest of both CNES and ISRO in studying ocean from space using altimetry system and in promoting maximum use of the ARGOS Data Collecting System."
