  "explanation": "The United Kingdom and Germany share the location of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Frontiers of the Roman Empire\". The Roman Empire, in its territorial extent, was one of the greatest empires histories has known. Enclosing the Mediterranean world and surrounding areas, it was protected by a network of frontiers stretching from the Atlantic Coast in the west to the Black Sea in the east, from central Scotland in the north to the northern fringes of the Sahara Desert in the south. It was largely constructed in the 2nd century AD when the Empire reached its greatest extent. This frontier could be an artificial or natural barrier, protecting spaces or a whole military zone. Its remains encompass both visible and buried archaeology on, behind and beyond the frontier."
