  "explanation": "<p>MangrovesÂ  are located at the interaction of land and sea, thus this ecosystem is called ecotone. Mangroves are halophytic evergreen plants growing on tidal coasts. They require high solar radiation and have pneumatophores or blind roots. They are marked by viviparous mode of reproduction in which seeds germinate in the tree itself before falling on the ground."
