  "explanation": "The 44th edition of G7 summit 2018 was hosted by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Quebec on June 8â€“9. This was the 6th time since 1981 that Canada has hosted the meetings. It was the first summit for Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. The summit was dubbed the \\\"G6+1\\\" by the French government and political commentators. This resulted from the United States withdrawing from the Iran Deal along with the Paris Agreement, rampant American protectionism, and fights with French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The 45th G7 summit will be held in 2019 in Biarritz, France. The G7 Summit is an event conducted annually where world leaders from seven powerful economies of the world viz. US, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Japan and Italy come together to discuss burning issues happening around the globe.They, by mutual understanding, also form policies or figure out remedies for the concerned issue."
