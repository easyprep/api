  "explanation": "The second five-year plan (1956-61) was based on Mahalanobis model. It laid foundation for economic modernization for long-term growth of India. It focussed on rapid industrialization by focussing on heavy indsutries and capital goods. Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis was the chief adviser to the planning commission from 1955. He founded the Indian Statistical Institute, and is considered the father of modern statistics in India. The Mahalanobis plan was, in a way, an invocation of the spirit of swadeshi or self-reliance.",
