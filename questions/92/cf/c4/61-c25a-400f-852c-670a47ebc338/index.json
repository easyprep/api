  "answer": "Its a new method of agriculture in which crops are cultivated inside multi-storey buildings",
  "explanation": "Vertical farming is a greenhouse method of agriculture where commercially viable crops are cultivated inside multi-storey buildings in cities to simulate natural ecological systems. Using advanced greenhouse technology such as hydroponics and aeroponics, the skyscrapers could theoretically produce fish, poultry, fruit and vegetables. Since everything is ‘hydroponics’ in this practice, ie, in mineral solutions, the problems of soil erosion, pesticide toxicity are not there."
