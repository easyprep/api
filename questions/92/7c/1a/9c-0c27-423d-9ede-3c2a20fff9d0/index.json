  "explanation": "S.R. Bommai was the Chief Minister of the Janata Dal government in Karnataka between August 13, 1988, and April 21, 1989. His government was dismissed under Article 356 of the Constitution and President’s Rule was imposed. The reason for the same being that the Bommai government had lost majority following large-scale defections. The then Governor of the Karnataka P. Venkatasubbaiah refused to give Bommai an opportunity to test his majority in the Assembly and imposed President’s rule in the state. Bommai went to court against the Governor’s decision to recommend President’s Rule. The Supreme Court struck down the decision of the Governor and in its verdict clearly laid down the conditions under which state governments may be dismissed."
