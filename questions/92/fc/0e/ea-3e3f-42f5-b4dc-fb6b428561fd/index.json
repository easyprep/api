  "option4": "None of them",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of them",
  "explanation": "<strong>Red color of red sea:</strong><br />Red sea is not actually red, but sometimes it appears that way. Red Sea got its name because of a type of blue-green algae called Trichodesmium erythraeum, which is found in the sea. When these blooms of algae die off they appear to turn the blue-green color of the ocean to a reddish-brown.<br /><strong>Red Rust of Tea</strong><br />It is caused by Cephaleuros virescens which is Green algae. The species of same Genus cause rust in coffee, mango and guava also.<br /><strong>Red Tide</strong><br />Red tides are caused by algae from the phylum Pyrrophyta (dinoflagellates), and not red algae (Rhodophyta))"
