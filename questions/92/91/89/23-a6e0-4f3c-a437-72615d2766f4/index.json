  "question": "With reference to the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) project, consider the following statements about &#8216;Neutrino&#8217; and its antiparticle &#8216;antineutrino&#8217;:<br> 1. While Neutrino had a positive charge, antineutrino has negative charge<br> 2. Both Neutrino and Antneutrino have zero mass<br> Which among the above statements is/ are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "The first statement is incorrect because the Neutrino is chargeless , and so is antineutrino. The difference between them is opposite spin. The second statement is also incorrect because have a very small, but nonzero mass. The travel with a speed , just less than the speed of light. They are able to pass thru matter very quickly and so almost undetectable."
