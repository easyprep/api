  "question": "Which of these is the force required to move a body uniformly in a circle?",
  "option1": "Centrifugal force",
  "option2": "Centripetal force",
  "option3": "Kinetic force",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Centripetal force",
  "explanation": "Centripetal force is the force required to move a body uniformly in a circle. This force acts along the radius and towards the centre of the circle. Centrifugal force is the force that arises when a body is moving actually along a circular path by virtue of the tendency of the body to regain its path."
