  "question": "Recently, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has cleared the consumption of &quot;khesari dal&quot;, which was banned in 1961. Which of the following statements is/are correct about Khesari dal? <ol> <li>It is said to cause neurological disorders in humans.</li> <li>It can be grown in both drought as well as waterlogged conditions.</li> <li>Rajasthan is the largest producer of Khesari dal in India</li> </ol> Select the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "First two statements are correct. <em>Third statement</em> is incorrect because Chhattisgarh is said to be the highest producer of Khesari dal in India. Khesari (Lathyrus odoratus) is a hardy pulse crop that can grow in both drought as well as waterlogged conditions. The grain is known produce a toxin called BAPN or beta-amino-propio-nitrile, which, when ingested, causes limb paralysis and bone deformity &mdash; the result of a neurological disorder called lathyrism. It was banned in 1961, but recently, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has cleared the consumption of khesari dal. Recent research suggests that sulfur amino acids have a protective effect against the toxicity of ODAP. Eating the chickling pea with grain having high concentrations of sulphur-based amino acids reduces the risk of lathyism if grain is available. Chhattishgarh is said to have the largest producer of this dal in India."
