  "question": "The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has recently decided to keep which country on grey list for failing to curb terror funding?",
  "option1": "Iraq",
  "option2": "North Korea",
  "option3": "Iran",
  "option4": "Pakistan",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Pakistan",
  "explanation": "International terror financing watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has decided to keep Pakistan on its grey list, despite Indiaâ€™s push to blacklist it in the aftermath of Pulwama terror attack. The decision was recently taken at the end of week-long meetings by the FATF in Paris. The Paris-based FATF stated that Pakistan has made only limited progress in curbing money laundering and terrorism financing. It failed to show a proper understanding of the risks posed by terror outfits like Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Jamat-ud-Dawa and others. Pakistan has until October 2019 to either comply with the demands made by FATF members or it could be blacklisted. The FATF has asked Pakistan to swiftly complete its action plan that includes showing sanctions were being applied in cases of money laundering and terrorism financing. It also has to demonstrate better cooperation between authorities, identify illegal money flows, and enhance support for prosecutors, among other measures.  Terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad had claimed responsibility for the Pulwama attack. Iran and North Korea are currently blacklisted."
