  "answer": "The money lenders had refused to advance loans to peasants",
  "explanation": "In this question, the most appropriate answer is B. We know that Lord Curzon had introduced the Punjab Land Alienation Act in 1900. In this act, it was laid down that non-peasant could buy lands from the peasants and neither could be attached their lands in case pf nonpayment of debts and nor keep the land in mortgage for more than 20 years. The result was the moneylenders stopped lending money and Lord Curzon had to open banks and these societies"
