  "question": "With reference to the recent discussion surrounding the regulation of drone usage, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Regulation of drone flights fall under the purview of DGCA.</li>\n<li>All drones in India require Unique Air Operators’ Permit for operation.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe DGCA/ Directorate general of Civil Aviation regulated drone operation in India. It had classified the drones into 3 categories with specific guidelines: nano, micro and small and other categories. The DGCA had also identified ‘no-drone zones’, such as the region surrounding Delhi’s Vijay Chowk.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nNot all drone types require the UAOP. The UAOP is like a drivers’ licence. It can be availed at 25,000 INR and would be valid for 5 years. Renewals are at the rate of 10,000 INR. Nano drones do not require the UAOP for operation. Drones bigger than a nano drone require UIN/ Unique Identification Number for operation."
