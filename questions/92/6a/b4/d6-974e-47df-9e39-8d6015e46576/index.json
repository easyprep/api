  "question": "Consider the following statements:<br> 1. The Gupta era saw an increased trade with the regions in today&#8217;s South East Asia<br> 2. Tamralipti, Ghantashala, and Kadura ports on east coast handled the north-Indian trade with south-east Asia<br> Which among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The campaigns of Samudra Gupta to the east and the south and the repeated tours of Harsha ensured the continuation of efficient communication, and goods moved easily to all parts of India. On the roads, pack animals and ox-drawn carts were used, and in certain areas elephants were used. The lower reaches of the large rivers such as the Ganges, Yamuna, Narmada, Godavari, Krishna, and Kaveri were the main waterways. The ports of the east coast, Tamralipti, Ghantashala, and Kadura handled the north-Indian trade with south-east Asia, and those of the west coast, Broach, Chaul, Kalyan and Cambray, traded with the Mediterranean and west Asia but the more southerly of these ports were outside Gupta control. The export of spices, pepper, sandalwood, pearls, precious stones, perfumes, indigo, and herbs continued as before but the commodities that were imported differed from those of earlier times. Chinese silk came in greater quantity, as did ivory from Ethiopia. The import of horses, coming from Arabia, Iran, and Bactria, either overland to centres in the north-west or by sea to the west coast, increased during this period. It is strange that India never bred sufficient horses of quality, the best blood having always to be imported; this was to have disastrous consequences on the cavalry arm of Indian armies, eventually making the cavalry ineffective, particularly in comparison with central Asian horsemen."
