  "question": "Which of the following is/are a vector quantity? <ol> <li>Temperature</li> <li>Work</li> <li>Kinetic Energy</li> <li>Momentum</li> <li>Power</li> </ol> Select the correct option from codes given below:",
  "option1": "2 and 4 Only",
  "option2": "4 Only",
  "option3": "2, 3, 4 and 5 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3, 4 and 5",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "4 Only",
  "explanation": "A scalar quantity is one which has only magnitude. A vector quantity has both magnitude and direction.<br> Temperature is a comparative measure of hot or cold and is expressed in Celsius, Fahrenheit and kelvin, which represents only magnitude and no direction.Hence temperature, is a scalar quantity.<br> Work is again a scalar quantity because W=F.S where F is force which is a vector quantity and S is displacement which is again a vector quantity.So, dot product of two vector quantity is a scalar quantity.<br> Power is again a scalar quantity as Power is defined as rate of work done<br> P=W/T, A scalar quantity divided by scalar is scalar.<br> Momentum is M=m.v where m is the mass of the body which is scalar quantity and v is the velocity which is vector quantity. Dot product of scalar and vector is vector.<br> K.E=1/2 mv^2, where v^2 is the dot product of two vector quantity and hence is scalar. Dot Product of two vector quantity is scalar."
