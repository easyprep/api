  "explanation": "Guyana and Venezuela are the two countries involved in the \"2015 Liza Oilfield Discovery Dispute\". In May 2015 ExxonMobil announced the discovery of more than 90 metres of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs about 200 km off the coastline, considered to be one of the largest crude oil discovery of the past decade. The oil and gas exploration activity by Guyana created a new source of tension with neighbouring Venezuela. The 2015 discovery set off a round of recriminations between Venezuela and its eastern border neighbour.",
