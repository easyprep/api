  "question": "A man had 16000 Rs., part of which he lent at 4% and the rest at 5% per annum simple interest. If the total interest received was 700 Rs.  In one year, the money lent at 4% per annum was :",
  "option1": "6000 Rs",
  "option2": "8000 Rs",
  "option3": "10000 Rs",
  "option4": "12000 Rs",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "10000 Rs",
  "explanation": "Let the sum lent at 4% = Rs. x \r\nâˆ´ Amount at 5% = 16000 - x\r\nAccording to the question, \r\n$latex \\\\frac{x\\\\times 4\\\\times 1}{100}+\\\\frac{(16000-x)\\\\times 5\\\\times 1}{100} = 700&s=1$\r\n$latex => 4x + 80000-5x = 70000$\r\n$latex => x = 80000 - 70000 = 10000$\r\nHence option [C] is correct answer."
