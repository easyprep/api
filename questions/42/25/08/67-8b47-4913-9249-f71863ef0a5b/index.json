  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Tide are the periodical rise and fall of the sea levels, once or twice a day, caused by the combined effects of the gravitational forces exerted by the sun, the moon and the rotation of the earth. The moon’s gravitational pull to a great extent is the major cause of the occurrence of tides because the moon’s gravitational attraction is more effective on the earth than that of the sun."
