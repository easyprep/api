  "question": "For the first time, India and which neighboringÂ state will conduct joint tiger census using a globally-recognised method?",
  "option1": "Myanmar",
  "option2": "Sri Lanka",
  "option3": "Nepal",
  "option4": "Bangladesh",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Nepal",
  "explanation": "For the first time, Nepal and India will conduct a joint tiger census in their national parks, forests and protected areas adjoining the two countries by using a globally-recognised method - camera tapping procedure from November 2017. By using this method, officials can avoid chances of repeated counting of the same tiger. The Chitwan National Park and Parsa Wildlife Reserve, which are the habitats of tigers in Nepal, are adjacent to the Balmiki Tiger Reserve in Bihar. Similarly, Nepal\\'s Bardiya National Park is close to India\\'s Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary while the Shuklaphanta National Park in Nepal adjoins India\\'s Dudhwa Tiger Reserve. The tiger is regarded as an endangered animal and is listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)."
