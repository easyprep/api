  "explanation": "Costa Rican Civil War took place between 12 March and 24 April 1948. The basic premises for the war was that when the Government of Costa Rica, though the legislature, decided to annul the 1948 General Election of Costa Rica accusing the victorious Otilio Ulate of electoral malpractices. This action provoked a group of the army under Jose Figueres Ferrer to rebel against the government decision. Under the United States support, the rebel army won the civil war and elected a constitutional assembly to frame and enact a new constitution under the supervision of the provisional government headed by Jose Figueres Ferrer. It was also decided to abolish entire Costa Rican military as the civil war was one of the bloodiest event in the Costa Rican history killing almost 2000 people."
