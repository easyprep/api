  "question": "That the per capita income in India was Rs. 20 in 1867-68, was ascertained for the first time by which of the following personalities?",
  "option1": "M. G. Ranade",
  "option2": "Sir W. Hunter",
  "option3": "R. C. Dutta",
  "option4": "Dadabhai Naoroji",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Dadabhai Naoroji",
  "explanation": "Naoroji was not satisfied with the official estimates regarding the national income of India during the British rule. “The Indian Economist” was the only journal which gave such knowledge in those days. Naoroji regarded this information regarding the country’s prosperity as insufficient and misleading. On the basis of the official data, Naoroji himself calculated the per capita income for the years 1867-70 at Rs. 20 only. On the other hand, the basic requirements of an ordinary labourer, as calculated by him was about Rs. 34. He concluded that even for such food and clothing which was provided to a criminal, a good seasonal production was not enough."
