  "option3": "1625 Rs",
  "option4": "2000 Rs",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1575.20 Rs.",
  "explanation": "Amount = \r\n$latex = P\\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{R_{1}}{100} \\\\right )\\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{R_{2}}{100} \\\\right )\\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{R_{3}}{100} \\\\right )&s=1$\r\n$latex = 10000\\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{4}{100} \\\\right )\\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{5}{100} \\\\right )\\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{6}{100} \\\\right )&s=1$\r\n$latex = 10000\\\\times \\\\frac{26}{25}\\\\times \\\\frac{21}{20}\\\\times \\\\frac{53}{50}&s=1$\r\n$latex A = 11575.2Rs.$\r\n$latex \\\\therefore C.I. = \\\\left ( 11575.2-10000 \\\\right ) = 1575.2Rs.$\r\nHence option [A] is correct answer."
