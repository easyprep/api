  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 & 3 Only",
  "explanation": "Rapid sputum tests&nbsp;are used to diagnose tuberculosis (TB) when other tests show that a person probably has TB.&nbsp;Positive IgM and IgG tests for dengue&nbsp;antibodies&nbsp;detected in an initial blood sample mean that it is likely that the person became infected with dengue virus within recent weeks.&nbsp;Doctors use thick and thin&nbsp;blood smears&nbsp;to determine whether one has malaria.&nbsp;"
