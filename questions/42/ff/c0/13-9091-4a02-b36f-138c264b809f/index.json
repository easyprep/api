  "option2": "3 only",
  "option3": "1 and 2",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe convention is to see a historic number of countries ratifying it and that too in record time. Atleast 3 countries must become party to it for implementation. It will ensure uniform structure for international commercial settlements and will work along the lines of the New York convention for international arbitration. India has already decided to ratify it (to be signed on August 7<sup>th</sup>, 2019).\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nIndia has taken several measures, apart from the decision to become party to the convention, to create an attractive environment for foreign and domestic investors. One of these measures is the decision to establish a statutory body, International Arbitration Centre at Delhi. Apart from this, India had made amendments to the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, and working to amend Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.\n<strong>Statement 3</strong> is correct:\nSingapore is increasingly emerging as an international centre for arbitration. An increasing percentage of its GDP is resulting from export of legal services. It had established Singapore International Arbitration Centre and the Singapore International Commercial Court. The commercial court has both domestic and international judges and will hear commercial lawsuits and its judgements will carry the same weight as the Singapore Supreme Court."
