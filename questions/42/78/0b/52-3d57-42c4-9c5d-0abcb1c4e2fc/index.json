  "answer": "It authorized the government to imprison people without trial",
  "explanation": "During the viceroyalty of Lord Chelmsford, a sedition committee was appointed by the government in 1918 with Justice Rowlatt, which made certain recommendations to curb sedition activity in India. The Rowlatt Act 1919, gave unbridled powers to the government to arrest and imprison suspects without trial. The act caused a wave of anger among all sections of the people. Even before the act was passed, popular agitations had begun against it. Gandhiji decided to fight against this act and he gave a call for Satyagraha on April 6, 1919. He was arrested on April 8, 1919. This led to further intensification of the agitation in Delhi, Ahmadabad and Punjab."
