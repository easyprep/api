  "option1": "Crops with varying maturity periods are sown together",
  "option2": "Crops with same maturity period are sown together",
  "option3": "Different soils are used for the same crops",
  "option4": "Crops with different nutritional requirements are grown",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Crops with different nutritional requirements are grown",
  "explanation": "Mixed cropping refers to a cropping technique in which two or more plants or crops are cultivated simultaneously in the same piece of land or farm. The seeds of plants are mixed before sowing. It is believed that planting multiple crops simultaneously helps save space as different crops in the same field usually ripen at different seasons. Furthermore, this technique also helps restore soil fertility as the remains of one plant aid the growth of another plant which helps increase the overall yield. The crops for mixed cropping are selected on the basis of their water need, nutrients requirements, the time required to grow and ripen."
