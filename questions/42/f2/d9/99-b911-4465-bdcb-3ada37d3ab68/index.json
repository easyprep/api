  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nA report submitted to the Madras High Court by an expert committee said that the Shola forests in the Nilgiris region are under threat from tea plantation. It is also under threat from Eucalyptus and invasive plants like Lantana camera, Parthenium, etc.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe report said that due to change in vegetation pattern, water stored in the ground is affected. This is also leading to massive landslides in the region. Trees like Eucalyptus are water hungry. They also displace native plants that serve as food source for the elephants.\n&nbsp;"
