  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nEco is a new currency to be adopted by 8 west African countries. The new currency is to replace the currently used CFA Francs (where CFA refers to French Colonies of Africa). The currency is to come into circulation in 2020.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nGuinea Bissau was not a former French colony. All of the other 8 countries adopting the Eco are former French colonies: Togo, Burkina Faso, Niger, Benin, Mali, Senegal and Ivory Coast. The CFA Franc was introduced in 1945 and was considered as a sign of French interference even post the countries’ independence."
