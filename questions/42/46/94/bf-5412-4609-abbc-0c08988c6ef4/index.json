  "question": "Root hair in plants are produced from which of the following?",
  "option1": "cortex",
  "option2": "pericycle",
  "option3": "epidermis",
  "option4": "endodermis",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "epidermis",
  "explanation": "Cells of the epidermis produce root hairs near the root apex. These cells are generally thin-walled, in contrast to the cells of the cortex, lying below the surface, which ultimately may become very thick-walled. The root hairs have fundamental importance in absorption of water and nutrients."
