  "answer": "Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)",
  "explanation": "Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will be launching a slew of strategically important satellites, which will help the military to keep an eye on activities of hostile neighbours and safeguard our land and sea borders. In September 2018, ISRO will launch Gsat-7A, for the Indian Air Force (IAF). Gsat-7A will be launched onboard GSLV Mk II rocket and will enable the IAF to interlink different ground radar stations, airbases and Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft. Gsat-7A will be similar to Gsat-7 or Rukmini, which was launched on September 29, 2013, for Indian Navy. Rukmini is considered as Indian Navy's 'eye in the sky' as it helps to monitor the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). Another strategically important satellite, Risat-2A will be launched by the end of 2018 onboard PSLV rocket. It is an advanced remote sensing satellite and will boost India's surveillance capabilities.",
