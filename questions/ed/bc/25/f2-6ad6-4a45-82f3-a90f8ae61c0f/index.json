These include: technology agnostic law; be applicable to the private sector and the government, maybe with different obligations though; informed and meaningful consent; minimal and necessary data processing; data controller must be accountable for any processing; establishing a high-powered statutory authority for enforcement, supported by a decentralised enforcement mechanism; and penalties for wrongful data processing to ensure deterrence. <strong>Sharada Prasad Committee</strong> Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship constituted the Sharada Prasad Committee to review, rationalise and optimise the functioning of Sector Skill Councils (SSCs), set up under the aegis of the National Skills Development Corporation (NSDC). Sector Skill Councils (SSCs) are industry led and industry governed bodies which have been mandated to ensure that skill development efforts being made by all the stake holders are in accordance with the actual needs of the industry and develop National Occupational Standards/Competency Standards and Qualification Packs (QPs). The Sector Skill Council also issues nationally recognised skills certificates."
