  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Plate motion/movement takes place primarily due to three factors-Polar Wandering, Continental drift and Sea floor spreading. Polar wandering is the relative movement of the earthâ€™s crust and upper mantle with respect to the rotational poles of the earth. Continental drift refers to the movement of the continents relative to each other. Sea floor spreading describes the movement of oceanic plates relative to one another. A glacial period (alternatively glacial or glaciation) is an interval of time (thousands of years) within an ice age that is marked by colder temperatures and glacier advances. Interglacials, on the other hand, are periods of warmer climate between glacial periods. The last glacial period ended about 15,000 years ago. The Holocene epoch is the current interglacial. A time when there are no glaciers on Earth is considered a greenhouse climate state."
