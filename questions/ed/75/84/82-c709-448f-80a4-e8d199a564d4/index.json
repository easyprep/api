  "option1": "Bacteria",
  "option2": "Fungus",
  "option3": "Algae",
  "option4": "Round Worm",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Bacteria",
  "explanation": "Scientists have discovered a new soil bacteria, Paraburkholderia madseniana sp., that may help in controlling soil pollution and fight climate change. P. madseniana is a bacteria discovered by researchers at the Cornell University. It is a ‘phenolic acid degrading bacterium’ noted for its ability to significantly breakdown of organic matter, including those that are carcinogenic. Its role in the carbon cycle has attracted attention for its use in fighting climate change. P. madseniana is a soil bacteria that was discovered in acidic forest soil. The genus to which the bacteria belongs is known for their ability to form root nodules, fix nitrogen in the soil and also break down aromatic compounds. The new species has been found to degrade organic matter like those based on phenolic acids. They can degrade cancer causing compounds that are released by burning of oil, gas, coal and other refuse. They can breakdown a soil contaminant called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)."
