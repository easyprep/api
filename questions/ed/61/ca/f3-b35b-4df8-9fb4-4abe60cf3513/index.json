  "question": "With reference to the radioactive decay, consider the following type of decays:<br> 1. The type of decay that causes the number of neutrons in the nucleus to decrease by 1<br> 2. The type of decay that keeps identity of the nucleus unchanged<br> 3. The type of decay that ejects the heaviest particle<br> Which among the following is the correct set of the types of decays corresponding to above respectively?",
  "option1": "B- decay, Gamma Decay, Alpha decay",
  "option2": "?+ decay, Gamma Decay, Alpha decay",
  "option3": "?- decay, Alpha Decay, Gamma Decay",
  "option4": "?- decay, ?+ decay, Alpha decay",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "B- decay, Gamma Decay, Alpha decay",
  "explanation": "When a nucleus undergoes ?– decay, a neutron is converted into a proton and an electron, and the electron is ejected. Because of this, the number of neutrons in the nucleus is decreased by 1. A nucleus in an excited energy state can “relax” to a lower energy state by releasing energy. If the photon(s) emitted in this process are in the gamma-ray portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, we refer to this “decay” as gamma decay. The numbers of protons and neutrons remain unchanged. When a nucleus undergoes alpha decay, it ejects an alpha particle, which is a helium-4 nucleus, composed of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is by far the heaviest decay particle that is ejected from a radioactive nucleus."
