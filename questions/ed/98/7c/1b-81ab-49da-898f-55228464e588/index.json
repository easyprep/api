  "question": "The tool CoastalDEM has been in news recently. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is used to collect land elevation data.</li>\n<li>The data collected by the CoastalDEM shows that India is more prone to flooding than previously thought.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nCoastalDEM is a tool that was developed to study land elevation data. It stands for Coastal Digital Elevation Model. It reportedly is able to eliminate the errors that are usually encountered while using data from NASAâ€™s SRTM/ Shuttle Radar Topography Mission.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe data obtained using the CoastalDEM tool showed that Indian coastlines are more prone to flooding than previously thought. This is in context with the rising sea levels. It found that at least 7 times as many people are threatened by sea level rise."
