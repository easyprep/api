  "question": "A sum of 3200 Rs. invested at 10% per annum compounded quarterly amounts to 3362 Rs. Compute the time period.",
  "option1": "$latex \\frac{1}{2}\\ year&s=1$",
  "option2": "$latex \\frac{3}{4}\\ year&s=1$",
  "option3": "$latex 1\\ years$",
  "option4": "$latex 2\\ years$",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "$latex \\frac{1}{2}\\ year&s=1$",
  "explanation": "$latex A = P \\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{R}{100} \\\\right )^{T}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{3362}{3200} = \\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{10}{400} \\\\right )^{4t}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{1681}{1600} = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{41}{40} \\\\right )^{4t}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\left ( \\\\frac{41}{40} \\\\right )^{2} = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{41}{40} \\\\right )^{4t}&s=1$\r\n$latex => 4t = 2,\\\\ t = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ year&s=1$\r\nHence option [A] is correct answer."
