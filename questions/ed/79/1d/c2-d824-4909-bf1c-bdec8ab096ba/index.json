  "explanation": "Thar desert is spread in India and Pakistan. 60% is in India and rest in Pakistan. In India, it is spread in four states viz. Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana and Punjab. The desert region can be divided into two parts – the ‘great desert’ and the ‘little desert’. The great desert extends from the edge of the Rann of Kuchch beyond the Luni river northward. The whole of the Rajasthan-Sind frontier runs through this. The little desert extends from the Luni between Jaisalmer and Jodhpur up to the northern west. Between the great and the little deserts lies a zone of absolutely sterile country, consisting of rocky land, cut up by limestone ridges."
