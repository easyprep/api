  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Hygiea is not a moon. Till now, it had been thought of as an asteroid. Currently, the astronomers are considering giving it the title of a dwarf planet. If it is declared a dwarf planet, it would join in as the sixth member of the group after Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake and Ceres.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nIt is located in the solar system. It is in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. It was recently observed by the SPHERE instrument of the VLT/ Very Large Telescope. It was reported that it satisfied the conditions for declaring a celestial body, a dwarf planet."
