  "option3": "1 and 2",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe NBCC or National Building Construction Corporation is a blue chip central public sector enterprise. It was classified as a navaratna company in 2014. This title allows it to invest upto 1000 crore INR without explicit government permission. The title system (miniratna, navaratna and maharatna) was established to give varying degrees of financial autonomy to the PSUs.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nNBCC is the implementing body for AMRUT/ Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation. It is also the implementer of other schemes for solid waste management (SWM), Pradhan Manthri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), etc. AMRUT, launched in 2015, seeks to improve the sewage and water supply infrastructure in urban settings for urban transformation.\n<strong>Statement 3</strong> is correct:\nThe unit currently falls under the ministry for housing and urban affairs. It was constituted under the now non-existent ministry of works, housing and supply. The NBCC was formed in 1960 and with its turning into a blue chip company, it had been upgraded into a navaratna company. In 2016, the government had planned to disinvest in it."
