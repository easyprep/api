  "question": "The researchers of which institute have developed a low-cost method for treating Osteoarthritis (OA)?",
  "option1": "IIT Roorkee",
  "option2": "IIT Bombay",
  "option3": "IIT Madras",
  "option4": "IIT Delhi",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "IIT Roorkee",
  "explanation": "The researchers at IIT-Roorkee have developed a low-cost method for treating Osteoarthritis (OA), a disease that causes pain and stiffness in the joints leading to degeneration of the bone cartilage. Under the new method, a nano-material and a polymer are injected around the knee joint followed by a regular heat therapy, which is believed to be far superior to the conventional treatment administered in the form of multiple injections and anti-inflammatory drugs like steroids, which have critical side effects."
