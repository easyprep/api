  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer commemorates the signing of the Montreal Protocol in 1987. The day was designated so by the UN General Assembly in 2000. The Montreal Protocol led to maximum eradication (99%) of ozone depleting chemicals.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe theme for this year’s observation in ‘32 years and healing’. This refers to the positive effects bought about by cooperation over the Montreal Protocol. The studies show that the ozone layer is healing at a rate of 1 to 3% since 2000. It is predicted that some parts of the ozone layer will heal completely by 2030."
