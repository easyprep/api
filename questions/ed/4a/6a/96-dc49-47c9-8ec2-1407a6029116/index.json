  "question": "Consider the following differences between conduction and convection modes of transfer of heat: <br> 1. While there is no actual movement of the molecules in conduction; convection is the transfer of heat by the actual movement of molecules<br> 2. While transfer of heat by conduction occurs in solids; transfer of heat by convection occurs in liquids and gases<br> Which among the above is / are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Convection and Conduction are the two different mode of heat transfer. Conduction is the process in which heat flows from higher temperature to lower temperature. Convection is the movement of fluid molecules from higher temperature to lower temperature regions. The transfer of heat by conduction occurs in solids while the transfer of heat by convection occurs in liquids and gases."
