  "question": "The water pollution in river is measured by the dissolved amount of which of the following impurities?",
  "option1": "Chlorine",
  "option2": "Ozone",
  "option3": "Nitrogen",
  "option4": "Oxygen",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Oxygen",
  "explanation": "Water pollution in river or any other water body is measured by amount of dissolved oxygen. Water pollution can be measured on the basis of parameters like dirtyness, change in texture, total suspended solid and other important factors like, <br />1. Decrease in dissolved oxygen (DO) (concentration of dissolved oxygen in water samples). <br />2. Increase in BOD, (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) it is a chemical procedure for determining the amount of dissolved oxygen needed by aerobic biological organisms in a body of water to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period. <br />3. Increase in COD, (Chemical Oxygen Demand) test is commonly used to indirectly measure the amount of organic compounds in water.\r\n&nbsp;"
