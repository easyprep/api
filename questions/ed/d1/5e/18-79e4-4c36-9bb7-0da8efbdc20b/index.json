  "option5": "",
  "answer": "France",
  "explanation": "Eurockeennes is one of France's largest rock music festivals. The Eurockeennes, a play on words involving rock and europ√©ennes (Europeans), is a festival based in a nature reserve beside Lac de Malsaucy Belfort. 1989 marked the first time around for the festival when it went under the name Le Ballon - Territoire de musiques, named after the nearby Ballon d'Alsace. The festival was organised to take place on the Ballon d'Alsace, but the peninsula on the Malsaucy lake was chosen in the end, because it was easier to link by car, bus and even train. It was the brainchild of the Conseil general of the Territoire de Belfort, who wanted to dynamise their department with a big cultural event for its youths. In 1990 the festival was renamed, Les Eurockeennes de Belfort."
