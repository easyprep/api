  "option3": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option4": "All are incorrect",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong> Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe MoU was signed between the National Medicinal Plant Board of India and Peru’s National Institute of Health. The cooperation will include conferences, meetings, research and training courses. These will not involve additional financial implication. The programs will use the existing budgets and plan schemes.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nPeru is a South American country with rich biodiversity. Like India, it also depends on traditional medicines to a high degree. Most of the medicinal plants occur in the Andes region and the Amazon forest region. Given its wide range of habitats (mountains, tropical forests, etc.), it hosts a variety of plant species.\n<strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe WHO issued a guideline for use of traditional medicine. The international body recognizes the significance of traditional medicines as almost all the countries and a large portion of its people depend on it. The current strategy is applicable for the period of 2014-2023. The strategy aims to build knowledge base for formulating national policies, strengthen regulatory mechanism and promote universal care and self-care."
