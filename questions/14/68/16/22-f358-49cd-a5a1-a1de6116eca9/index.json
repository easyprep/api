  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nMyanmar is not a member of IORA/ Indian Ocean Rim Association. Though senior officials had decided to make the country a member, it failed to get it after South Africa lodged opposition. Previously, Bangladesh and Somalia had blocked its entry in context with the Rohingya issue.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nMaldives is now a part of IORA. Its entry was aided by Indian diplomatic activities. It is the 22<sup>nd</sup> member of IORA. The presidential elections in Maldives and its result is said to have contributed to the IORA members allowing its entry into the group."
