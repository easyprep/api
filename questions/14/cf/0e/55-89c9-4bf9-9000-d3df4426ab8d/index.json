Hepatitis B and C are blood-borne infections, with significant transmission of hepatitis B occurring in early life and of hepatitis C occurring through unsafe injections, including injection drug use, and medical procedures. Similarly, Hepatitis D is transmitted from exposure to infected blood. The disease was recently in news when World Health Organisation (WHO) in its first-ever Global Hepatitis Report, has set the goal to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030.&nbsp;"
