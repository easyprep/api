  "option1": "Tunisia",
  "option2": "Libya",
  "option3": "Kenya",
  "option4": "Ethiopia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Libya",
  "explanation": "India has recently evacuated its entire contingent of peacekeeping forces comprising 15 CRPF personnel from Tripoli after the situation suddenly worsened in Libya. Indian Ambassador in Tunisia has the concurrent charge of Libya. The military conflict in Libya escalated after  the self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA), led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, recently launched a surprise air strike in an area in Tripoli. On the other hand, UN-backed internationally recognized government headed by Fayez al-Sarraj vowed a major counteroffensive. The move could potentially drag the country back into civil war. The United Nations has called for a two-hour truce to allow evacuations of civilians and the wounded. Libya has been torn by violence and political instability since long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed in 2011 uprising."
