  "question": "Consider the following statements regarding the Cyclone Pabuk which was recently in news:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It was formed in South China Sea</li>\r\n<li>It is considered to be Bombogenesis, a term used to describe powerful low-pressure systems that intensify rapidly</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 only",
  "option2": "2 only",
  "option3": "Both 1 and 2",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 only",
  "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct- Cyclone Pabuk was formed in South China Sea, and created havoc in Philippines and Thailand. The cyclone ripped through South Andaman caused minor damages with heavy winds gusting at a speed between 50-70 kmph with lashing rains uprooting trees and damaging power transmission and distribution lines. <br />Statement 2 is incorrect: An \\\"explosive cyclogenesis\\\", or bomb cyclone, is currently developing in the northwest Pacific Ocean. This process is the extra tropical equivalent of the tropical rapid deepening. Thus bombogenesis occur only in extra tropical cyclone and not tropical cyclone like pabuk."
