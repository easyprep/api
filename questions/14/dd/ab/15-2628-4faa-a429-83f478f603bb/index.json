  "answer": "1 & 3 Only",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is correct</u>. Governor of a state can be removed by the president on the advice of union cabinet. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u>. The grounds upon which Governor of a state can be removed by President are not laid down in constitution. <u>Third statement is correct</u>. It is the discretionary power of the governor to reserve a bill for the consideration of the president if he/she thinks necessary. Governor of a state draws the ordinance making power from Article 213 of the constitution. He/She can promulgate ordinance only when the Legislative Assembly is not in session and where there are two Houses in a State, both Houses are not in a session. Also, the Governor must be satisfied that such circumstances exist which render it necessary for him to take immediate action."
