  "answer": "It was a German kingdom",
  "explanation": "The \"Kingdom of Prussia\" was a German kingdom. The Kingdom of Prussia was a German kingdom that constituted the state of Prussia between 1701 and 1918. It was the driving force behind the unification of Germany in 1871 and was the leading state of the German Empire until its dissolution in 1918. Although it took its name from the region called Prussia, it was based in the Margraviate of Brandenburg, where its capital was Berlin. Prussia is considered the legal predecessor of the unified German Reich (1871â€“1945) and as such a direct ancestor of today's Federal Republic of Germany. The Kingdom left a significant cultural legacy, today notably promoted by the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, which has become one of the largest cultural organisations in the world."
