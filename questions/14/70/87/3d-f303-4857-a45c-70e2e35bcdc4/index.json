  "option1": "4 only",
  "option2": "1, 2 and 3",
  "option3": "1, 2 and 4",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "4 only",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was signed between the US and the erstwhile Soviet Union in 1987. It was a landmark achievement in reducing the nuclear arms race in the European region. After the dissolution of the Soviet, the treaty was inherited by the successor states like Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan, etc. It calls for elimination of missiles stock in the intermediate range and allows for verification by observers from different sides. US and Russia have suspended participation in the treaty.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Joint Strike Fighter Program is a US led program for acquisition and development of various fighter aircrafts. It features the F-35. The program has partners in 3 levels depending upon their investment. Countries like UK are in level 1, Italy and Netherlands like countries in level 2 and the lastly Turkey like countries in level 3. However, Turkey has been terminated by the US government from the program because of its S-400 missile deal with Russia.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nIndia is not a member of the program. Though US had sought to sell the F-35 aircrafts to India, it didn’t agree to technology transfer. This is because Indian policies call for local manufacture of the aircraft and that would entail critical defence technology transfer. US produces the F-35 components in Texas and the final assembly process at its facilities in Italy and Japan.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is correct:\nThe F-35 aircraft is significant for its stealth features- it’s not detected by conventional RADAR. However, the S-400 system is able to detect and eliminate the fighter. It makes use of long-range surveillance radars that detect the fighter and sends launch data to the launch vehicle upon receiving permission from the command vehicle. The launched missile is guided by an engagement radar.\n&nbsp;"
