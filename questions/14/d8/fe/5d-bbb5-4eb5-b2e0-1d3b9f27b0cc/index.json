  "explanation": "Mbuluzi River is one of the main rivers of Eswatini and Mozambique. There are two sources of the river, one in the Highveld north of Mbabane forming the Black Mbuluzi and one in the Middleveld near Manzini forming the White Mbuluzi or imbuluzane. The river flows through the northeast of Swaziland especially through Hlane Royal National Park and Shewula Nature Reserve. The main dam fed by the river in Swaziland is the Mnjoli dam which is located not far from the sugar plantations of Mhlume. In Mozambique, it becomes Umbeluzi feeding water to the Pequenos Libombos dam and ends at the Maputo Bay."
