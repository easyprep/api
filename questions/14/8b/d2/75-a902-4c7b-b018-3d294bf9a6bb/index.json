  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "<ul>\r\n<li>First statement is not correct in case of India, while correct in case of UK.

Speaker of Lok Sabha can be removed only by a resolution passed by the Lok Sabha by an absolute majority (ie, a majority of the total members of the House). The motion of removal must be supported by at least 50 members.</li>\r\n</ul>"
