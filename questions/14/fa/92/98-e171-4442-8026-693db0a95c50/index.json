  "answer": "Annular solar eclipse",
  "explanation": "An annular solar eclipse would occur on 21 June this year. The annular phase is expected to be visible from some places of the country.\r\nIt would be seen as partial solar eclipse from the rest part of the country. A solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the sun and the earth and blocks the light of the sun from reaching the earth. As a result, the shadow of the moon is cast on the earth.  Annular eclipse happens when the moon is farthest from the earth and a ring of fire structure is seen."
