  "question": "The \"Strait of Dover\" is located between which two countries?",
  "option1": "Ukraine and Russia",
  "option2": "France and United Kingdom",
  "option3": "Canada and United States of America",
  "option4": "Mexico and United States of America",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "France and United Kingdom",
  "explanation": "Strait of Dover, also known as the Dover Strait or the Dover Narrows, is a naturally formed narrow navigable waterway located in the Atlantic Ocean that connects the English Channel to the North Sea, thereby separates Great Britain from continental Europe. The entire strait is located between and within the territorial waters of France and the United Kingdom, but a right of transit passage under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) exists allowing unrestricted shipping. Most maritime traffic between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea and Baltic sea passes through the Strait of Dover, rather than taking the longer and more dangerous route around the north of Scotland."
