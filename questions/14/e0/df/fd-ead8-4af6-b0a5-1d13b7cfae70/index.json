  "option1": "Jeremy Bentham",

  "option3": "Dante Germino",
  "option4": "G. W. F. Hegel",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "G. W. F. Hegel",
  "explanation": "The Idealist theory was chiefly advanced by G.W.F. Hegel who was a German philosopher which eulogizes the state as an embodiment of reason and holds that individual's freedom lies in accepting the dictates of the ideal state. This theory is sought to prove disastrous when an existing government is allowed to exercise authority of the ideal state without questioning the character of the persons who form that particular government."
