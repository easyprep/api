The devotees of Lalon from across the country and the world have congregated at the shrine to participate in the 3-day-long programme which is being organised by the Lalon academy and the culture ministry of Bangladesh. Lalon is believed to be born in 1774 though no written records exist. He died in 1890. His songs talk about humanism, love and equality going beyond the limitations imposed by religion, caste and creed.Â  His contemporary Gurudev Rabindra Nath Tagore got some of his songs transcribed and published."
