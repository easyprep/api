  "question": "Consider the following statements regarding a motor car battery: <br />I. The voltage is usually 12 V. <br />II. Electrolyte used is hydrochloric acid.<br />III. Electrodes are lead and copper.<br />IV. Capacity is expressed in ampere-hour.<br />Which of the above statements are correct?",
  "option1": "I and II",
  "option2": "II and III",
  "option3": "III and IV",
  "option4": "I and IV",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "I and IV",
  "explanation": "In case of motor car battery or automotive batteries a nominal 12-volt potential difference is provided by connecting six galvanic cells in series. Capacity of these batteries is expressed in amperehour. Electrolyte used is a solution of about 35% sulphuric acid and 65% water and electrodes used are plates of lead and separate plates of lead dioxide."
