  "explanation": "P + SI for 5 years = 5200…………(I)\r\nP + SI for 7 years = 5680…………(II)\r\nOn subtracting equation (I) from (II) \r\nSI for 2 years = 480\r\n∴ SI for 1 years = 240\r\n∴ From equation (I), \r\nP + 5 $latex \\\\times$ 240 = 5200\r\n$latex => P = 5200 - 1200 = 4000 Rs.$\r\n$latex \\\\therefore R = \\\\frac{SI\\\\times 100}{T\\\\times P}&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{240\\\\times 100}{1\\\\times 4000} = 6\\\\%&s=1$\r\nHence option [D] is correct answer."
