  "question": "Which of the following radical is also known as the &#8220;atmospheric detergent&#8221; ?",
  "option1": "Chlorine radical",
  "option2": "Hydroxyl radical",
  "option3": "Methyl radical",
  "option4": "Ozone radical",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Hydroxyl radical",
  "explanation": "One of the most important chemical components of the troposphere is the &#8216;hydroxyl radical&#8217;: a highly reactive substance composed of an oxygen and a hydrogen atom, denoted &#8216;OH&#8217;. Hydroxyl radicals react with just about any other trace gas they encounter, removing them from the atmosphere.For example, OH combines with toxic carbon monoxide to generate carbon dioxide. In this sense, OH &#8216;cleans up&#8217; the troposphere, and is sometimes called the detergent of the atmosphere."
