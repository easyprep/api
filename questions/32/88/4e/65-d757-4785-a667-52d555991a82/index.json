  "question": "With reference to the UN special report on climate change highlighting the impact of permafrost thawing, consider the following statements about the situation in India:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Permafrost thawing can cause glacial lake outburst flooding.</li>\n<li>Permafrost terrain have been identified in the Indian part of Himalayas.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nPermafrost is the land/ rock that has been under the 0 C for atleast 2 years. The permafrost terrain around the world has been thawing and causing an increase in emission of carbon. This is because carbon dioxide bubbles trapped in the permafrost escape upon thawing. This thawing also causes other damages in the form of GLOF which poses a threat especially in regions with dams and reservoirs.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nPermafrost terrain had been mapped in Himachal Pradesh’s Kullu district. An Indo-Swiss study mapped the district and found 9% of permafrost terrain. This was the first attempt to study and map this geological feature in India. Most of the studies focus on glaciers’ melting rather than thawing permafrost."
