  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "All are incorrect",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nArab Spring Movement that influenced many countries in the African and Middle-east region also affected Yemen. The unrest has now escalated to become the worst man-made disaster as declared by the UN. The UN team highlighted the prevalence of torture, rape and other war crimes on the Yemeni people. The team is also looking to identify the perpetrators.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nYemen, in 2017, faced the worst Cholera outbreak in history. The outbreak was compounded by the conflict as medical aid and sustenance could not reach a large portion of the population. The UN had earlier reported that some of the warring factions were involved in cutting off access to aid from the people.\n<strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong>\nUsing child soldier is considered a war crime. Yemen crisis is reported to involve child soldiers. These children are being used to fight the Houthi rebels and are usually hired from Sudan. Other countries that use child soldiers as identified by UN are Congo, Central Africa, Iraq, Myanmar, etc.\n&nbsp;"
