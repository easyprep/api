  "question": "Consider the following statements: <ol> <li>The flash point of a liquid hydrocarbon is the minimum temperature at which the liquid ignites without the presence of external ignition source</li> <li>The kindling point of a substance is the lowest temperature at which it ignites in presence of an external ignition source</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "Both are incorrect statements<br> First statement is incorrect because the flash point of a liquid hydrocarbon is the minimum temperature at which the liquid ignites in presence of ignition source. Second statement is also incorrect because the kindling point of a substance is the lowest temperature at which it ignites without an external ignition source."
