Born at Patna Sahib in Bihar on 5th January 1666, Guru Govind Singh was the 10th Sikh guru. He succeeded his father Guru Tegh Bahadur Singh as leader of Sikhs at the age of just nine. The 10th Sikh Guru was a spiritual leader, philosopher, poet and master warrior. He is considered as the eternal guru by his followers because of his contribution to Sikhism. He founded the Sikh warrior community called \\'Khalsa Panth\\' at Anandpur Sahib in 1699, and introduced the Five Ks, the five articles of faith that Khalsa Sikhs wear at all times."
