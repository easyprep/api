  "question": "Most coral reefs&nbsp;across the world would perish if the surrounding water temperature goes above 31&deg;C. However, the coral reefs in Persian Gulf can withstand temperature up to 35&deg;C. What may be the reason(s) for the same? <ol> <li>Coral reefs of Persian Gulf use different genetic mechanism when compared to corals reefs of other water bodies.</li> <li>Water in the Persian Gulf is less polluted than other water bodies of the world.</li> </ol> Select the correct code from options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is correct</u> because the algae in Gulf corals belong to a group not known for its thermal tolerance and use different genetic mechanism when compared to corals reefs of other water bodies. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u> because Persian Gulf is small and the water there is generally more polluted due to oil spills in water."
