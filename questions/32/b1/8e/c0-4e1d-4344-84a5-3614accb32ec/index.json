  "question": "Consider the following statements about the Sendai Framework: <ol> <li>The Sendai Framework is the successor instrument to the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA)</li> <li>India is the first country that held the first ever international conference on Disability and Disaster Risk Management (DRM) in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 was adopted at the Third UN World Conference in Sendai, Japan, on March 18, 2015. <u>First statement is correct.</u> The Sendai Framework is the successor instrument to the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u> because Bangladesh is the first country that held the first ever international conference on disability and DRM in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 (SFDRR). The Sendai Framework also articulates the following: the need for improved understanding of disaster risk in all its dimensions of exposure, vulnerability and hazard characteristics; the strengthening of disaster risk governance, including national platforms; accountability for disaster risk management; preparedness to “Build Back Better”; recognition of stakeholders and their roles; mobilization of risk-sensitive investment to avoid the creation of new risk; resilience of health infrastructure. Recently, the GOI proposed to establish National Disaster Database (NDD) that aims to establish a unique database will capture nationwide losses of properties and lives occurring due to disasters and will ensure that states compulsorily report and feed all losses real time into the dynamic platform being developed by the Centre. This would also help the Centre in deciding the quantum of future investments in critical infrastructure depending on the performance of states in disaster risk reduction. Currently, India relies on global estimates on its losses caused by man-made and natural disasters."
