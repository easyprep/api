  "question": "Which of the following gases helps in bread/cake fermentation so as to make it soft and spongy?",
  "option1": "Carbon Monoxide",
  "option2": "Hydrogen",
  "option3": "Carbon dioxide",
  "option4": "Oxygen",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Carbon dioxide",
  "explanation": "<p>Bread rises due to the process of fermentation, a chemical process by which molecules such as glucose are broken down anaerobically. Fermentation refers to the chemical decomposition of complex organic compounds into simpler substances. With bread, this refers to the process where yeast converts sugar to carbon dioxide and alcohol in the absence of oxygen, causing the dough to rise. During the process of dough fermentation, we turn a sticky mess of dough into a well-supported structure, which looks and smells delicious. It starts with water, flour and yeast. Once these are combined in the mixing bowl, the fermentation begins. The longer the process continues the effects of it become more powerful. Hydrated flour develops into gluten. The process of yeast acting on the starches in the flour creates gas. The gas gets trapped between strands of gluten which forms pockets of air. The air pockets expand which force the dough rise. Larger air pockets make a more open crumb and lighter textured bread. The creation of lactic and acetic acids condition the dough. Organic acids create flavour, enhance the dough handling properties and extend the keeping qualities of the bread. Ethanol produced in the process of creating carbon dioxide gas will largely evaporate when baked though traces remain to support odour, flavour and keeping quality.</p>"
