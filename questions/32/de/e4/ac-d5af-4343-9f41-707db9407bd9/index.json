  "question": "For the healthy growth of Coral Reefs, the conditions required is / are:<br> 1.Relatively warm tropical oceans with around 20Â°C temperature<br> 2.Ocean water with plenty of sedimentation<br> 3.Relatively high salinity in Ocean water<br> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 1",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "Coral reefs are huge deposits made up dead shells and secretions of marine organisms like Corals, Calcarious algae, stomato pteroids, gartopods Mollusca etc. The deposits are mostly made up of Calcium Carbonate. Conditions required for their growth: <ol> <li>Warm tropical oceans located between 30 degree north and 25 degree south latitudes where a minimum temperature of 20 degree is found and this temperature favour the growth of coral organisms.</li> <li>Oceanic water free of sedimentation.</li> <li>Transparent parts of ocean bodies.</li> <li>Relatively low salinity ocean bodies.</li> </ol>"
