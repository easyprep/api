  "question": "In light of several states’ meeting to curb the drug menace, the Punjab Control of Organised Crimes Act was highlighted. Which of the following statements about this act are correct?\n<ol>\n<li>Under this act, confessions made before the police can be used during court process.</li>\n<li>PCOCA is based on a similar law in Maharashtra.</li>\n<li>India is the largest legal grower of Opium.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 and 2",
  "option2": "1 and 3",
  "option3": "2 and 3",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe PCOCA allows for court recognition to confessions made before the police personnel of DIG rank and ratified by ADGP rank officer. Current law doesn’t consider confessions before police as valid evidence during court proceedings. This will change if the act is enforced. However, the act is feared for its misuse for political vendetta, disproportionate increase in police powers, etc.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe act is based on the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crimes Act, 1999. MCOCA was enacted as the existing legal framework was unable to curb the rampant crime in ‘Mumbai underworld’. It includes stringent provisions like intercepting communications (oral, electronic, wire etc). Confessions before senior police is admissible in court trials.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nIndia is the largest legal grower of Opium. Only medicinal purposes can be serviced by these cultivations, under the law. But, it is estimated that about 5% is converted to illegal heroin. In addition to this, India is a major transit point between the Golden Triangle (North-west) and the Golden Crescent (to the east). These two groups of countries suffer the maladies of drug trafficking."
