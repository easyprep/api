  "question": "What happens to the weight of Iron, when it rusts?",
  "option1": "Increases for long time",
  "option2": "Decreases then increases",
  "option3": "Increases then decreases",
  "option4": "Remains the same",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Increases then decreases",
  "explanation": "When iron or any other metal oxidizes, oxygen from the air combines with the iron to make iron oxide or rust. So, weight of the bar increases, due to the increased weight of oxygen which has combined with the iron. over time, the weight of the iron bar will tend to decrease, due to factors related more to erosion than to chemistry."
