  "question": "In order to have a better understanding of the clouds and their interaction with atmospheric aerosols and to enhance accuracy in predicting rainfall, two high altitude cloud observatories have been commissioned so far. These observatories are located in which two states?",
  "option1": "Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh",
  "option2": "Odisha and Tamil Nadu",
  "option3": "Maharashtra and Kerala",
  "option4": "Gujarat and Meghalaya",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Maharashtra and Kerala",
  "explanation": "High altitude cloud physics observatory at Munnar is used to observe cloud and rain processes over a region. Currently, only two High altitude cloud physics laboratories are functional. One is located at Mahabaleshwar (Konkan) and the other is located at Munnar (Kerala). They aim to study the monsoon cloud microphysics process modulated by the Western Ghats."
