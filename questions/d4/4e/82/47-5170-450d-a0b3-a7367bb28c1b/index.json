  "question": "Who among the following streamlined the Maratha administration after Sambhaji?",
  "option1": "Raja Ram",
  "option2": "Balaji Viswanath",
  "option3": "Ganga Bai",
  "option4": "Nanaji Deshmukh",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Balaji Viswanath",
  "explanation": "Best answer is Balaji Vishwanath. As Sambhaji (1680-89) were succeeded by Rajaram, Shivaji II, Tarabai and Shahu ji. Balaji Vishwanath played a crucial role in the final victory of Shahu by winning over almost all the Maratha sardars to the side of Shahu. Under Baji Rao I Maratha power reached a zenith. But that option is not given."
