  "question": "Which of the following can work as agents of Biological Weathering?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Wild animals</li>\r\n<li>Lichens and Mosses</li>\r\n<li>Insects</li>\r\n<li>Microbes</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 4",
  "option3": "Only 2, 3 & 5",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "All of the above can cause biological weathering. Lichens and mosses grow on essentially bare rock surfaces and create a more humid chemical microenvironment. The attachment of these organisms to the rock surface enhances physical as well as chemical breakdown of the surface microlayer of the rock."
