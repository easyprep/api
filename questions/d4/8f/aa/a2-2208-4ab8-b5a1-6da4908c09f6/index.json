  "question": "Debayan Saha, who has invented PM 2.5 device to curb air pollution, is graduate from which IIT?",
  "option1": "IIT Kharagpur",
  "option2": "IIT Bombay",
  "option3": "IIT Delhi",
  "option4": "IIT Indore",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "IIT Kharagpur",
  "explanation": "Debayan Saha, a mechanical engineering graduate from IIT Kharagpur, has invented a device called \\\"PM 2.5\\\" which he claimed when fitted near the silencer pipe in vehicles will curb air pollution. The technology developed by him uses a combination of electric energy and wave energy to influence the pollutants like PM 2.5 such that they act like magnet attracting other particulate pollutants from the ambient atmosphere to get attached to it. As they grow bigger in size they become heavy and fall off safely on the ground like soil."
