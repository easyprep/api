  "question": "Consider the following statements:<br> 1. Banana plant has a pseudostem<br> 2. Eye of the potato marks its point of attachment to the plant<br> Which among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "Banana is one of the most important fruit crops grown in India. After harvest of fruit, huge quantity of about 60 to 80 tones per hector of waste biomass (pseudostem, leaves, suckers etc.) is generated. Presently, this biomass is discarded as waste. In India, presently this biomass is dumped on roadside or burnt or left in situ causing detrimental impact on environment. Though, the technologies for extraction of fibers and paper making from pseudostem are available, yet it has not been adopted by the industries mainly due to high transport cost. However, there exist a vast potential of extracting fibers from pseudo stem. The quantity and quality of fibers show wide variability with cultivars. The fiber extracted from banana pseudostem could not command proper market owing to its restricted use in cottage industries. There appears to be good scope of profitable use of this fiber in textile and paper industries on commercial scale. Eyes of potato are dormant buds."
