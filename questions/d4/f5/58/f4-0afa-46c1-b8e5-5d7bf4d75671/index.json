He reached the summit of the mountain which is at an elevation of 4,367m on November 11, 2018. With this, Satya has scaled 5 of the 7 volcanic summits. In a few days, he will now set out to summit Mt Wilhelm - the highest mountain of Papua New Guinea.   Once successful, Satya will be the first from India to scale these two  mountains. In September 2018, Satyarup Siddhanta and Mousumi Khatua created history by climbing Asia\\'s highest volcanic peak Mount Damavand and became the first Bengalis to do so. Mt Damavand is the highest peak in Iran and also a potentially active volcano."
