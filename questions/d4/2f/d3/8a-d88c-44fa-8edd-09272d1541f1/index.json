  "option3": "1654 Rs.",
  "option4": "1655 Rs.",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1655 Rs.",
  "explanation": "$latex \\\\because CI = p\\\\left [ \\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{R}{100} \\\\right )^{T}-1 \\\\right ]&s=1$\r\n$latex = 5000\\\\left [ \\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{10}{100} \\\\right )^{3}-1 \\\\right ]&s=1$\r\n$latex = 5000\\\\left [ \\\\left ( \\\\frac{11}{10} \\\\right )^{3}-1 \\\\right ]&s=1$\r\n$latex => CI = \\\\frac{5000\\\\times 331}{1000} = 1655\\\\ Rs.&s=1$\r\nHence option [D] is correct answer."
