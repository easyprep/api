  "answer": "Ecuador",
  "explanation": "Catequilla, which is also known as Monte Catequilla or Kati-Killa, is an archaeological site located in the Pomasqui Valley of Ecuador. This site manifests the pre-Columbian era Quitu-Cara culture. This site is made up of stone materials. It was presumably used as an astronomical observatory even before the arrival of the Incas, and is the only prehispanic site in the Americas that is located precisely at the Earth's Equator. It is said to be in the Middle of the World. As of 2011, it is said to be the only important pre-Inca site in Ecuador to have been commercially exploited.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"></sup>"
