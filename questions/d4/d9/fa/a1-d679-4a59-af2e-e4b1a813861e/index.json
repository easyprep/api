  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Carbon Dioxide",
  "explanation": "Global warming potential (GWP) is defined as the heat absorbed by the greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, as a multiple of the heat that would be absorbed by the same mass of CO2. GWP is 1 for CO2. For other gases it depends on the gas and circumstances."
