  "question": "Consider the following observations with reference to Polar Vortex:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It’s a circulation of upper level winds in high pressure system of north and south poles</li>\r\n<li>Polar Vortex generally leads to major cold air outbreaks in Northern Hemisphere</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above observations is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "The polar vortex is circulation of strong, upper-level winds that normally surround the northern pole in a counterclockwise direction a polar low pressure system. It may located near either of a planet’s geographical poles. On Earth, the polar vortices are located in the middle and upper troposphere and the stratosphere. The polar vortex can lead to major cold air outbreaks in any portion of the Northern Hemisphere—North America, Europe and Asia. This will lead to cold snaps in multiple locations, though not always."
