  "question": "Which of the following is known as the \"Egyptian Blue\"?",
  "option1": "Sodium Copper Silicate",
  "option2": "Calcium Copper Silicate",
  "option3": "Titanium Copper Silicate",
  "option4": "Potassium Copper Silicate",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Calcium Copper Silicate",
  "explanation": "Egyptian Blue is a very stable synthetical pigment of varying blue colour. It is a calcium copper silicate that was the first synthetic pigment and the most extensively used from the early dynasties in Egypt until the end of the Roman period in Europe. Many specimens, well over 3000 years old, appear to be little changed by the time. Egyptian blue could find use in the modern era in applications such as biomedical analysis, telecommunications, and lasers, according to a new report. Two hundred years ago, chemist and inventor Sir Humphry Davy went to the ruins of Titus’ baths in Rome. There he found several large lumps of a deep blue mixture of silica and fluxes which is fused at high temperature to make glass. Soon after, Davy found the same material on a pot in Pompeii. He realised that he had rediscovered the material ‘of which the manufacture is said to have been anciently established at Alexandria’, the first synthetic pigment, Egyptian blue."
