  "question": "Which one of the following has 'ohm' as its unit?",
  "option1": "Resistivity",
  "option2": "Conductivity",
  "option3": "Conductance",
  "option4": "Inductive Reactance",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Inductive Reactance",
  "explanation": "The unit of Inductive Reactance is 'ohm'. Inductive Reactance = Angular frequency x Inductance Inductive reactance is defined as the opposition to a changing current flow. It is measured in ohm. Any changing current in an inductor will be impeded because of the inductance associated with it."
