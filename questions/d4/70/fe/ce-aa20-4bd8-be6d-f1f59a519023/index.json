  "explanation": "The International Day of Reflection on the 1994 Rwandan genocide is observed every year on 7th of April in memory of the victims of the genocide in Rwanda. The 1994 genocide is considered the hallmark example of violence that was ignored by the international community. In 994, around 800,000 Tutsis were slaughtered in Rwanda in a hundred-day campaign.  Hence, the United Nations established the day to remember members of the Tutsi community, an African ethnic group, which were killed or injured in the atrocities. The Day of Reflection offered an opportunity to consider the factors that had led to such mass atrocity and to renew the collective pledge of “never again”."
