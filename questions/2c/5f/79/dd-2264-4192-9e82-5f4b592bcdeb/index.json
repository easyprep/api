  "explanation": "In a bid to cut power consumption, the Indian Railways has laid out plan to make all stations 100 per cent LED lit by March 31, 2018. LED (light-emitting diode) bulbs are more energy efficient and have a longer lifespan as compared to traditional lamps. Till November 2017, about 3500 railway stations have already been made 100 per cent LED lit. About 20 lakh LED lights were installed in this process. This initiative is expected to reduce energy consumption by 10 per cent and will translate into annual savings of Rs 180 crore for Indian Railways.",
