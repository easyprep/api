  "explanation": "The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has celebrated the 159th Income Tax Day i.e. Aaykar Diwas on 24th July 2019. The week preceding the Aaykar Diwas 2019 has been marked by various activities undertaken by the regional offices of the department across the country. The event will include release of departmental publications, e-journal, publicity kit for outreach programmes among other things.  It was on 24th July 1860 that Income Tax was introduced for the first time in India by Sir James Wilson to compensate for the losses incurred by the British regime during the first war of independence against British Rule. This is why 24th July is observed as the Income Tax Day."
