  "question": "In light of India’s role in promoting solar power around the world, which of the following statements are correct?\n<ol>\n<li>India established the International Solar Alliance.</li>\n<li>Global Solar Atlas provides information about the solar power potential of each region.</li>\n<li>India recently developed a solar cell based on kumkum dye.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 and 2",
  "option2": "1 and 3",
  "option3": "2 and 3",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe ISA is a global body composed of more than a 100 sunshine countries. The alliance was spearheaded by India and France. It is also called the International Agency for Solar Policy and Application/ IASPA. Sunshine countries are those that fall in the tropics and receive sunlight for most of the year.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe Global Solar Atlas was developed by the World Bank Group, i.e., World Bank and the International Finance Corporation. The atlas was launched in partnership with the ISA in Abu Dhabi. It gives information about the solar power potential of any place around the world. This will help identify potential places for solar power generation infrastructure’s establishment.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nIndia recently developed a cost effective form of dye sensitised solar cell from kumkum dye. The dye called New Fuchsin/ NF dye. It uses aqueous electrolyte and doesn’t require the expensive platinum electrodes for ion transfer. The conventional silicon based cells are disadvantageous, since silicon disposal results in pollution. The dye is organic and doesn’t suffer the same disadvantage. India enjoys the lowest expenditure per MW of solar energy produced."
