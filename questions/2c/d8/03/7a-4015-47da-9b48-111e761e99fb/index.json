  "answer": "Islamabad",
  "explanation": "The 7th edition of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Asia Regional Conservation Forum was held in Islamabad, Pakistan. During the summit, experts said that the rapid melting of glaciers and reduced snowfall in the Himalayas due to climate change will cause water and food shortage for more than 8 hundred million people inhabiting the region if effective adaptation and mitigation measures are not implemented before 2030. The Himalayan mountain range is 2,500Km long with an average width of around 300 kilometers spanning China, Pakistan, India, Nepal and Bhutan. It is home to around 15,000 glaciers, holding around 600 billion tonnes of ice, which feed major perennial river systems including the Indus and Mekong, and sustain 1.65 billion people."
