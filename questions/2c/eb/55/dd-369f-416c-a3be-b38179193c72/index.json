  "answer": "Terror Finance",
  "explanation": "The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an inter-governmental body whose purpose is the development and promotion of policies, both at national and international levels, to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. It was created in the year 1989. It is a “policy-making body” which works to generate the necessary political will to bring about national legislative and regulatory reforms in these areas. The FATF has issued its recommendations in various years – 1990, 1996, 2001, 2003, 2012. The body monitors the progress of its members in implementing necessary measures, reviews money laundering and terrorist financing techniques and counter-measures, and promotes the adoption and implementation of appropriate measures globally. FATF Plenary, which is the decision-making body of the FATF meets three times in a year. There are 38 members of the body including the European Commission. <br /><strong>What is the Grey-list and Black-list? <br /></strong> The FATF Black-list means the list of \"Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories\" (NCCTs). These are the countries which have been judged by the FATF to be non-cooperative in the global fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, calling them \"Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories\" (NCCTs). When a country gets black-listed it means that the country will not be financed by institutions like IMF etc. The Grey-list means giving the countries in the list a warning before black-listing them. Countries in this list will find it tough to get financial aids from international markets and may face downgrades from multilateral lenders like IMF, World Bank, ADB, EU and also a reduction in risk rating by Moodys, S&amp;P and Fitch."
