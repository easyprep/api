  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe UNCTAD/ UN Conference on Trade and Development had published the Trade and Development Report 2019. The report shows that both developing and developed countries have witnessed a drop in the labour’s share of GDP from 1980s. The share has dropped to about 50%.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe report highlights that the lost share has been transferred to the capitalists. Since 1980s, over 10% of the GDP has been transferred to the corporations. These corporations have seen an increase in their profit share. The low wages and de-regularised labour market has favoured private investment."
