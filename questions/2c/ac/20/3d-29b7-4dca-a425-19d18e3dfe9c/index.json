Bastille was a medieval armory, fortress, and political prison which represented royal authority and a symbol of the French monarchy's abuse of power. Revolutionaries saw the fall of the Bastille as a flashing point of the French Revolution. France celebrates every year on 14 July as the Bastille Day, which is their national day. The French National Day is the anniversary of the Storming of Bastille (Bastille Day) on 14 July 1789."
