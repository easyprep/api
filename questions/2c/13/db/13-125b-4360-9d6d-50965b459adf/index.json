  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nMatch-fixing is not a criminal offence in India. It is however an illegal practice in India. Sri Lanka is the first South Asian country to bring such penalisation of the practice. Apart from Sri Lanka, Australia, England, etc. have also criminalised the practice.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Justice Lodha committee had recommended the legalisation of betting in India. In line with this, the apex court had set up the Justice B S Chauhan committee. This committee recommended the criminalisation of match-fixing in India. It also recommended severe punishment for the same."
