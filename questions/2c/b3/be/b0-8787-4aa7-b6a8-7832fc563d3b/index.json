  "answer": "Democratic Republic of Congo",
  "explanation": "M23 Rebellion happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo from 4 April 2012 to 7 November 2013. The aftermath of the Second Congo War and the consequent Kivu Conflict leads to the start of the M23 Rebellion. This rebellion was started when the National Congress for the Defence of the People defected the Democratic Republic of Congo government and formed the March 23 Movement which clashed with the government forces. The Congolese government successfully suppressed the rebellion with the help of the United Nations peacekeeping mission MONUSCO which leads to the disarmament and demobilisation of the M23 Movement."
