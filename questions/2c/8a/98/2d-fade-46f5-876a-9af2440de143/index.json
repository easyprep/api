  "question": "The NGT has called for the clearing of floodplains by 2020. In this context, consider the following statements about floodplains in India:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Most of the damaging floods in these regions are due to drainage congestion.</li>\n<li>Uttar Pradesh has the largest expanse of flood prone area.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nFloodplains are predominantly flat lands adjacent to rivers that are prone to flooding seasonally. These plains experience floods naturally and enable dissipation of excess energy. Floodplains have good drainage but construction activity in these regions reduces this capacity. As a result, the annual flooding becomes a disaster.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nIndia has about 40 million hectares of flood prone area. Of this, the largest percentage lies in UP with about 21.9 million hectares. Other major flood prone expanses are in Bihar, Assam, West Bengal and Odisha. These floods mostly occur along the floodplains of Ganga, Yamuna and Brahmaputra."
