Consider the following statements about the vest:\n<ol>\n<li>It is India’s lightest bullet proof vest.</li>\n<li>It is a soft armour.</li>\n<li>It makes use of carbon nano-materials.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below<strong>: </strong>",
  "option1": "1 only",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 and 3",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe Bhabha Kavach weighs 9.2 kg and is India’s lightest in its category of protective vest. The vest is about half a kilogram lighter than MHA’s prescription. The vest was developed at the Ordnance Factories Board and MIDHANI. MIDHANI is a metals and alloys manufacturing public sector enterprise. The vest will serve the central armed Police Forces.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThere are 2 types of bulletproof vests available- the soft vests and the hard vests. Bhabha Kavach is a hard vest that provides protection against high calibre rounds like those of AK-47 (7.62mm bullets) and steel jacketed rounds. Soft vests are not as heavy and are used by VIPs and bodyguards against small handgun bullets.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe vest makes use of carbon nanotechnology developed at the BARC/ Bhabha Atomic Research Centre and was named in its honour. It is manufactured from high density polyethylene/ HDPE and uses thermo-sealing before treatment with the nanoparticles. This makes the vest tough and able to slow a bullet down.\n&nbsp;"
