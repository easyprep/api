  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "Iran has recently announced to stop respecting limits on its nuclear activities agreed under a 2015 nuclear deal with major powers until they find a way to bypass renewed US sanctions. The Iran nuclear deal was formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has given an ultimatum of 60 days to remaining signatories - the UK, France, Germany, China and Russia - to implement their promises to protect Iran\\'s oil and banking sectors from US sanctions. The nuclear deal was designed to curb Iran\\'s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.  Under the landmark deal, Iran is required to sell its surplus enriched uranium abroad, rather than keep it, thereby allowing it to generate nuclear power without building nuclear weapons. In it, Iran agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions."
