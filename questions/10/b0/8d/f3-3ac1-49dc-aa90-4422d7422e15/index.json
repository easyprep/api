  "question": "What happens to the resistance of a p-n junction diode when forward biased?",
  "option1": "it becomes high",
  "option2": "No effect",
  "option3": "it becomes low",
  "option4": "it becomes zero",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "it becomes low",
  "explanation": "The resistance of a p-n junction diode becomes low when forward biased and becomes high when reverse biased. This is the principle of the working of rectifier."
