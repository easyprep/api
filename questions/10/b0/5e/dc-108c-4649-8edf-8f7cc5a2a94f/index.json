  "option1": "Bikaner",
  "option2": "Dehradun",
  "option3": "Pune",
  "option4": "Gwalior",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Gwalior",
  "explanation": "The Union cabinet has recently approved a proposal for setting up the Centre for Disability Sports at Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh to benefit para-sports in the country. The centre will be built at an estimated cost of Rs 170.99 crore over a period of five years & will be registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. The centre will have a Governing Body comprising a maximum of 12 members, some of them experts from \\\"National Level Sports Federations apart from experts in para games\\\". The Section 30 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016, requires the government to take measures to ensure \\\"effective participation of Persons with Disabilities in sports activities which includes the provision of infrastructural facilities for sports activities for them\\\". The upcoming centre was proposed in the budget of 2014-15. At present, no specialized sports training facilities for Divyangjan are available in the Country. Hence, this void is proposed to be filled up by setting up sports infrastructure so that persons with disabilities (Divyangjan) can undergo rigorous and specialized training in this Centre."
