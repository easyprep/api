  "explanation": "France forms the starting and the finishing point of the solo transatlantic single-handed offshore yacht race, first held in 1977, \"Mini Transat 6.50\". Mini Transat 6.50 also known as Transat 650 is a solo transatlantic yacht race, and associated Classe Mini class, that (typically) starts in France and ends in Le Marin bay, Martinique in the Caribbean, an island territory of France. The race covers over 4,000 miles with a stop in the Madeira or the Canary Islands. The yachts are very small considering the scope of the race and are sanctioned by the Miniclasse 6.5 organization and material specifications, which make the mini Transat 650 boat an open design."
