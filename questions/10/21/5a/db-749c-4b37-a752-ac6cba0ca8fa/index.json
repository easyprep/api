The festival will offer a diverse mix of some of the most celebrated and Oscar nominated movies from the Nordic-Baltic region. This platform offers a great opportunity for Nordic-Baltic countries to reflect on the similarities and appreciate their differences. It will also prove to be a platform to enhance people-to-people relations and share the thrill, excitement and experience of watching films together. The Nordic-Baltic countries -- Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden, or NB8 -- are tied together geographically and historically through trade, culture and many common yet diverse value systems."
