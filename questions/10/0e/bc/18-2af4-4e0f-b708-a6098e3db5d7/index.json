This has greatly contributed in encouraging FDI in the country but has been a medium of tax evasion.Â <br /><strong>Profit Shifting<br /></strong>Allocation of income and expenses between related corporations or branches of the same legal entity (e.g. by using transfer pricing) in order to reduce the overall tax liability of the group or corporation.<br /><strong>Debt Dumping<br /></strong>Transferring a bad debt to a group company located in a higher-tax rate country in order to write off the debt in that."
