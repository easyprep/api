  "question": "In light of astronomers spotting the second interstellar objects’ visit to the solar system, consider the following statements about interstellar objects:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Bennu was the first interstellar object to visit the solar system.</li>\n<li>Kruger 60 is the home star system of 2I/Borisov.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe first interstellar object to visit the solar system is Oumuamua. The comet was spotted in 2017 as it was heading out of the solar system. Due to late spotting of this oblong object, scientists weren’t able to gather much information. In case of Borisov comet, the scientists are expecting to be more prepared for its entry into the solar system.\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Borisov comet is reported to be from the Kruger 60 star system. This is a binary star system that is over 13 light years away from Sun. both the stars are red dwarves which are much smaller and cooler than the sun.\n&nbsp;"
