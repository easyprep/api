  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Comets",
  "explanation": "Comets are similar to small snowballs of frozen gases, rock and dust that orbit the Sun in our solar system. When they pass close to the Sun, they release gases. When they are frozen, they form a size of a small town. They exist beyond Neptune, where a population of dark comets orbits the Sun in the realm of Pluto. These icy objects, occasionally pushed by gravity into orbits bringing them closer to the Sun, become the so-called short-period comets."
