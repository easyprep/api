  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "<p class=\\\"Explanation\\\">Indian coal is high in silica and alumina and is highly abrasive, with high slagging characteristics. Its high ash content of 35-45 per cent and the weak coal transportation system in the country mean that it is economical to locate power plants close to pit heads. Most of the pit head stations have their own dedicated coal transportation system and do not depend on Indiaâ€™s railways."
