  "explanation": "The World Poetry Day (WPD) is celebrated every year on March 21 across the world to honour poets, tradition of poetry recital and promotes reading poetry. Apart from celebrating the poetic expression and the linguistic diversity, one of the main objectives of the day is to offer endangered languages an opportunity to be heard and read within communities. The day was adopted in 1999 during UNESCOâ€™s 30th session held in Paris. The day also seeks to reprise the age-old tradition of poetry recitals, mark a confluence between poetry and other creative fields like theatre, music and dance and also promote teaching poetry. The day is also designated to find newer ways to make poetry accessible and not make it seem outdated."
