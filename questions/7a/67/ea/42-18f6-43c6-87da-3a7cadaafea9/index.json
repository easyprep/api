  "answer": "Both fiscal deficit and revenue deficit",
  "explanation": "Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBMA) concerns both fiscal deficit and revenue deficit.<br />A fiscal deficit is a shortfall in a government\\'s income compared with its spending. The government that has a fiscal deficit is spending beyond its means. A fiscal deficit is calculated as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), or simply as total dollars spent in excess of income.<br />A revenue deficit occurs when realized net income is less than the projected net income. This happens when the actual amount of revenue and/or the actual amount of expenditures do not correspond with budgeted revenue and expenditures."
