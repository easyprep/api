Trujillo Era spans from 1930 to 1961 when Rafael Trujillo was the true President of the Dominican Republic in this period. Rafael Trujillo literally imposed a dictatorship of 31 years in the country from 1930 to 1961. He ruled the Dominican Republic using the iron-fisted regime. In this period, the Dominican Republic witnessed progress in healthcare, education, transportation with building of hospitals, clinics, schools, roads and harbours. Trujillo was successful in negotiating an undisputed border with Haiti, a housing construction programme and a pension plan he was successful in making the country debt-free. But this was not without any blemishes, his regime carried out absolute repression and the copious use of murder, torture and terrorist methods against the opposition."
