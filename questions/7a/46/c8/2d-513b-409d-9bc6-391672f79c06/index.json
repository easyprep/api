  "question": "&nbsp;Which of the following statements is/are correct about the Draft Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2016? <ol> <li>The draft provides for the establishment of State Level Wetland Authority in each state</li> <li>The new draft rules mention categorising a land as wetland on the basis of biodiversity, reefs &amp;&nbsp;mangroves</li> </ol> &nbsp;Select the correct option from codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct because the draft provides for the establishment of State Level Wetland Authority in each state thus transferring the power from centre to states in matter related to decision on wetlands. Second statement is incorrect because the draft rules mention no ecological criteria to categorise a land as wetland. Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rules of 2010 had criteria for categorising a land as wetland on the basis of biodiversity, reefs, mangroves, and wetland complexes. But the new draft rules contain no ecological criteria for categorising a land as wetlands."
