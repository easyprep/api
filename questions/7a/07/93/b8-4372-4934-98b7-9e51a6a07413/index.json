The magazine was used by Jonas and his fellow Fjolnismenn to promote Icelandic nationalism, in the hope of giving impetus to the Icelandic Independence Movement. Jonas remains one of Iceland's most beloved poets, penning some of the best-known Icelandic poems about Iceland and its people. Since 1996, Jonas's birthday has been officially recognised in Iceland as the Day of the Icelandic Language.",
