  "question": "Consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The melting point of a substance decreases with the increase of pressure on the substance</li>\r\n<li>Surface tension decreases with increase in temperature of liquid</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Surface tension decreases when temperature increases because cohesive forces forces decrease with an increase of molecular thermal activity. The decrease of surface tension with increase in temperature results because the kinetic energy of molecules increases. As the pressure on the substance increases, the melting point decreases."
