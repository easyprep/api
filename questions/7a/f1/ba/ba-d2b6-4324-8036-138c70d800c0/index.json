  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "The red panda is endemic to the temperate forests of the Himalayas, and ranges from the foothills of western Nepal to China in the east. Its easternmost limit is the Qinling Mountains of the Shaanxi Province in China. Its range includes southern Tibet, Sikkim and Assam in India, Bhutan, the northern mountains of Burma, and in south western China, in the Hengduan Mountains of Sichuan and the Gongshan Mountains in Yunnan. Slow lorises are found in South and Southeast Asia. Their collective range stretches from Northeast India through Indochina, east to the Sulu Archipelago (the small, southern islands of the Philippines), and south to the island of Java (including Borneo, Sumatra, and many small nearby islands). Third statement is incorrect. Lion-tailed Macaque is naturally found in Western Ghats"
