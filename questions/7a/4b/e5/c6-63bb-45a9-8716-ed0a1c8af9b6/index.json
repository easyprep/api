  "explanation": "The 1941 Iraqi coup d'etat is also known as the \"Rashid Ali Al-Gaylani coup or the Golden Square coup\". The 1941 Iraqi coup d'etat, also called the Rashid Ali Al-Gaylani coup or the Golden Square coup was a nationalist coup d'etat in Iraq on 1 April 1941 that overthrew the pro-British regime of Regent 'Abd al-Ilah and his Prime Minister Nuri al-Said and installed Rashid Ali al-Gaylani as Prime Minister. The coup was led by four Iraqi nationalist army generals, known as \"the Golden Square\", who intended to use the war to press for full Iraqi independence following the limited independence granted in 1932. To that end, they worked with German intelligence and accepted military assistance from Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. The change in government led to the British invasion of Iraq and subsequent occupation until 1947.",
