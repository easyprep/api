  "option2": "144th",
  "option3": "131st",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "136th",
  "explanation": "India has been ranked 136th out of 180 countries in the latest annual World Press Freedom Index (WPFI-2017). As per report, the rank has been slipped 3-places due to threats from (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi\\'s nationalism\\\" and growing self-censorship in the mainstream media. The report also mentioned that journalists were increasingly targets of online smear campaigns and threats. The 2017 WPFI compiled by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) reflects a world in which attacks on the media have become commonplace and strongmen are on the rise. The index is topped by Norway, followed by Sweden, Finland and Denmark. China has acquired 176th position among 180 nations and is described as the “world’s leading prison for citizen journalists”."
