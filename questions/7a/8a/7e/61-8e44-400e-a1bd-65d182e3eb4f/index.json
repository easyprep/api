The Cabinet also gave nod to the Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill - 2018 to deal with those escaping overseas to avoid getting caught. The Bill will help in laying down measures to deter economic offenders from evading the process of Indian law by remaining outside the jurisdiction of Indian Courts. According to Union Finance ministry, the economic offences worth Rs 100 crore or more will come under the purview of the Bill."
