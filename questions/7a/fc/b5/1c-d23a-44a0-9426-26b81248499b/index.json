  "answer": "Ethiopia",
  "explanation": "The fortified historic town of Harar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is situated on a low plateau on the eastern flank of the Great Rift Valley, about 50 km south-east of Dire Dawe, a city in Ethiopia. It is a walled Muslim city, said to be the fourth holiest city of Islam, with 82 mosques and 102 shrines dating back as far as the 10th century. The city walls were completed in the 16th century, and it served as the capital of the Harari Kingdom from 1520 to 1568, becoming an independent emirate in the 17th century. Today, the town is particularly noted for the architecture of its townhouses, packed within the city walls with 368 narrow alleyways providing access. Its urban fabric combines traditional African and Islamic elements in a unique way, with the infusion of Indian immigrants at the end of the 19th century adding a further dimension to the architectural character of the town."
