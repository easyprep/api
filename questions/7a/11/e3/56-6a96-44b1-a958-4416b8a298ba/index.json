  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Uttar Pradesh",
  "explanation": "The Uttar Pradesh government recently decided to establish India\\'s first conservation reserve for blackbuck in Allahabad’s Meja Tehsil. The blackbuck conservation reserve is proposed to be established in Meja Forest Division of Allahabad. Black deer conservation reserve would also help in wooing tourists in this region. As per estimates, the reserve will be established over 126 hectares in the trans-Yamuna region and initially, a herd of around 350 blackbucks would be inhabited in the reserve. The U.P. government evoked Section 36A (1) and (2) of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, to declare the conservation reserve. Blackbucks are known for their majestic spiral horns and coat colour contrasts. They are found in grasslands and open forests. They once ruled the open savannahs of the north and central India, but are now restricted to just a few patches and habitats."
