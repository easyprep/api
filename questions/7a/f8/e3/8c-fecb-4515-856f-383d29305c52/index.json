The Act empowers the Central Government to appoint an officer not below the rank of a Director to the Government of India or an equivalent officer of a State Government to be an adjudicating officer to hold an enquiry as to whether any person has contravened any provisions of the Act or any rule, regulation or direction or order made there under which renders him liable to pay penalty or compensation.
