  "answer": "Cooler air held close to the ground by the hot air above",
  "explanation": "In Iran, schools were closed for a week due to severe air pollution. Tehran was engulfed in thick toxic smog and the situation was worsened due to the thermal inversion, a phenomenon that occurs when a layer of warm air settles over a layer of cooler air that lies near the ground. The warm air holds down the cool air and prevents the pollutants from dispersing."
