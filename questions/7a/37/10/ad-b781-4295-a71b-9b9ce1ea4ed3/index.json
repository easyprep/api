  "question": "With reference to the centre’s recent sugar export policy to deal with surplus stocks, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The WTO’s Agreement on Agriculture subjects export subsidies for marketing costs to reduction commitments.</li>\n<li>Sugarcane crops fetch the least returns among Indian crops.</li>\n<li>Surplus sugar stock increases accumulation of cane price arrears of farmers.</li>\n</ol>\n     Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) of WTO in its article 9.1 subjects certain export subsidies to reduction commitments. These includes subsidies on marketing costs like handling, transport, upgradation, etc. The present scheme is described to be compliant with the reduction commitments, which is different for developed and developing countries.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe sugarcane crop fetches one of the highest returns among its competitive crops. It fetches nearly 60% higher returns than comparable crops. This drives more farmers to cultivate canes despite issues like cane price arrears from sugar mills, water scarcity, etc. This is a major contributor to the present surplus condition.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nThis sugar season’s end stock is expected to be 162 MLT. The high surplus will force the sugar prices downwards. The downward pressure will affect the liquidity of sugar mills. Consequently, this will aggravate the cane price arrears and will affect the farmers’ incomes."
