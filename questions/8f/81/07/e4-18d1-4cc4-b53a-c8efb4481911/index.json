  "question": "Consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>All the 22 amino acids can not be synthesized in human body so must be supplied in the diet.</li>\r\n<li>Soya Protein is a source of all amino acids, so its called a complete protein</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "The first statements is incorrect because number of essential amino acids is 9, which cannot be synthesized de novo by the organism (usually referring to humans), and therefore must be supplied in the diet. Soybean protein is a “complete protein” since it provides all of the essential amino acids for human nutrition, so second statement is also incorrect."
