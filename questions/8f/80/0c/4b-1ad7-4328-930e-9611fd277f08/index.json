  "answer": "Dominica",
  "explanation": "The Soufriere-Scott's Head Marine Reserve is located on the Scott's Head village on the south-western tip of the island country of Dominica in the Windward Islands of the Lesser Antilles Archipelago. It is the most picturesque bay on the island, both below and above the water. The area is dominated by the Scott's Head or Cashacrou Peninsula separating the Calmer Caribbean Sea from the wilder Atlantic Ocean. During the islands turbulent past, the headland was home to English and French soldiers depending on the period of English and French occupation. The Bay is an extinct volcanic crater plummeting to indeterminate depths as a lava chute. There are many Carib or Kalinago (Dominica's indigenous people) myths and legends associated with the area adding to its mystery and grandeur."
