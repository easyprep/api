  "option5": "",
  "answer": "A German theoretical physicist",
  "explanation": "Max Planck who is known for \"Planck constant\" and \"Third law of thermodynamics\" was a German theoretical physicist. Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck (23 April 1858 – 4 October 1947) was a German theoretical physicist whose discovery of energy quanta won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918. Planck made many contributions to theoretical physics, but his fame as a physicist rests primarily on his role as the originator of quantum theory, which revolutionized human understanding of atomic and subatomic processes. In 1948 the German scientific institution Kaiser Wilhelm Society, of which Planck was twice president, was renamed Max Planck Society (MPS). He is widely known for Planck constant; Planck postulate; Planck's law of black body radiation; Fokker–Planck equation; Nernst–Planck equation; Third law of thermodynamics."
