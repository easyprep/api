  "question": "Which of the following is the newly discovered planet also named as “hot Jupiter” on the basis of its size and temperature?",
  "option1": "HD 131399Ab",
  "option2": "NGTS-1b",
  "option3": "LHS 1140b",
  "option4": "TRAPPIST-1",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "NGTS-1b",
  "explanation": "The newly discovered planet “NGTS-1b” is a “gas giant”. Due to its size and temperature, it is known as a “hot Jupiter”, a class of planets that are at least as large as our solar systems very own Jupiter, but with around 20 per cent less mass. Unlike Jupiter, NGTS-1b is very close to its star - just three per cent of the distance between Earth and the Sun, and completes an orbit every 2.6 days, meaning a year on NGTS-1b lasts two and a half Earth-days. NGTS-1b is the first planet to be spotted by The Next- Generation Transit Survey (or 'NGTS') which employs an array of 12 telescopes to scour the sky."
