  "question": "Consider the following pairs:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Halosere - succession in a saline environment</li>\r\n<li>Psammosere - succession in sand</li>\r\n<li>Xerosere - succession in dry area</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "2 & 3 Only",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Halosere is a succession in a saline environment. An example of a halosere is a salt marsh. Psammosere is an ecological succession that began life on newly exposed coastal sand. Sand dune systems are best examples of it. Xerosere is a plant succession that is limited by water availability such as salt deserts, rock deserts etc."
