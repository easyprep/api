  "question": "Neil Armstrong was the first person to reach on the moon. While walking on the moon what happens to his mass and weight?",
  "option1": "His mass remained the same but weight increased",
  "option2": "His mass remained the same but weight decreased",
  "option3": "His mass as well as weight decreased",
  "option4": "His mass increased but weight remained the same",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "His mass remained the same but weight decreased",
  "explanation": "Mass is a measure of the amount of matter that an object has, or how much “stuff” it is made up of<strong>. </strong>Weight is a measure of how much gravity pulls on a mass or object. Mass doesn\\'t change when gravity changes. The mass on the moon would be the same as the mass on earth. The force due to gravity is 1/6 that of Earth, so he will weigh 1/6 of Earth weight."
