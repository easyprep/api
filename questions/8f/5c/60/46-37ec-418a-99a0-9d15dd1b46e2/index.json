  "question": "In many parts of India, sowing of Sunn hemp crop is practiced well ahead of the cultivation of the main agricultural crop. What advantage is offered by Sunn hemp due to this practice?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It improves soil fertility by adding organic biomass quickly to soil</li>\r\n<li>It is able to fix large amount of nitrogen which is available for main crop</li>\r\n<li>It helps in reducing soil erosion and conservation of soil water</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Sunn hemp has been used extensively as a soil improvement or green manure crop in the tropics because of its ability to produce large amounts of biomass in as little as 60 to 90 days. Because of this, it has the potential to build organic matter levels and sequester carbon. Also, as a legume it can fix large amounts of nitrogen. Used as a cover crop, sunn hemp can improve soil properties, reduce soil erosion, conserve soil water, and recycle plant nutrients. ‘Tropic Sun’ is also resistant to root-knot nematodes."
