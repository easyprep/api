  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The bonnet monkey is endemic to peninsular India. It is commonly found at temples in South India. Recently, researchers have observed that this species is being steadily replaced by the aggressive rhesus monkey from northern parts of the country. Although the bonnet monkey has the conservation status of “least concern”, the scientists believe the species may soon become endangered. As per recent collated information on bonnet macaque, its presence from 1989 and 2015 along 651 km of Mysore's roadsides and found that over the last 25 years a staggering 65% of the population has disappeared. It is 35–60 cm long plus a tail of 35–68 cm. Males weigh 5.5 to 9.0 kg, females 3.5 to 4.5 kg. Captive monkey can live up to 35 years."
