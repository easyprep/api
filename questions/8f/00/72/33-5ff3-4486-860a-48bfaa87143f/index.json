  "question": "Why helium is used for respiration in deep water instead of nitrogen?",
  "option1": "It is heavier than nitrogen",
  "option2": "It is lighter than nitrogen",
  "option3": "It mixes less in blood than nitrogen",
  "option4": "It helps oxygen burn more quickly",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "It mixes less in blood than nitrogen",
  "explanation": "Air contains a large amount of nitrogen and the solubility of gases in liquids increases with increase in pressure. Therefore, air in oxygen cylinders used for diving is diluted with helium gas. This is done as He is sparingly less soluble in blood."
