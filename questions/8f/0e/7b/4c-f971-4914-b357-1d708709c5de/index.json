  "option4": "Denmark",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "France",
  "explanation": "The \"Historic Centre of Avignon: Papal Palace, Episcopal Ensemble and Avignon Bridge\" is a UNESCO World Heritage Site of France. In the 14th century, this city in the South of France was the seat of the papacy. The Palais des Papes, an austere-looking fortress lavishly decorated by Simone Martini and Matteo Giovanetti, dominates the city, the surrounding ramparts and the remains of a 12th-century bridge over the Rhone. Beneath this outstanding example of Gothic architecture, the Petit Palais and the Romanesque Cathedral of Notre-Dame-des-Doms complete an exceptional group of monuments that testify to the leading role played by Avignon in 14th-century Christian Europe."
