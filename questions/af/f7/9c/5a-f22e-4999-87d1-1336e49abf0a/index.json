  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Portugal is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west and south and by Spain to the north and east, Canada has only one neighbor i.e. US. UK has one neighbor Ireland.

On this island, there is one sovereign country located, which is Brunei and rest of the island is shared by Malaysia and Indonesia. Largest island, entirely in Indonesia is Sumatra."
