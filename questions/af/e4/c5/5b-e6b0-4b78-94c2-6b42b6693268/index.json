  "question": "Which of the following is the efficiency of a Carnot engine(a = Temperature of source, b=Temperature of sink)?",
  "option1": "1 - b/a",
  "option2": "1 - a/b",
  "option3": "1 + b/a",
  "option4": "1 + a/b",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 - b/a",
  "explanation": "Carnot engine is a reversible engine operating between two temperatures T1 (source) and T2 (sink). The Carnot cycle consists of two isothermal processes connected by two adiabatic processes. The efficiency of a Carnot engine is given as: 1 - T2/T1"
