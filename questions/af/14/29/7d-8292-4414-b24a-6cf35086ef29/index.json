  "question": "Consider the following statements with respect to the Kuttanad Below Sea Level Farming System:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It is the only system in India that practices rice cultivation below sea level.</li>\r\n<li>Karapadam, Kayal and Kari are the main varieties of rice produced via this system</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above is / are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">Kuttanad is a delta region of about 900 sq. km situated in the west coast of Kerala State, India. The area is a larger mosaic of fragmented landscape patches and varied ecosystems such as coastal backwaters, rivers, vast stretches of paddy ﬁelds, marshes, ponds, garden lands, edges, corridors and   remarkably networked water ways. \r\n<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">The Kuttanad Below Sea-level Farming System (KBSFS) is unique, as it is the only system in India that practices rice cultvation below sea level. The major land use structure of KBSFS is ﬂat stretches of rice ﬁelds in about 50,000 ha of mostly reclaimed delta swamps. The rice fields, which are popularly known as \\\"Puncha Vayals\\\" exist in three landscape elements:  Karapadam (upland rice ﬁelds), Kayal (wetland rice ﬁelds) and Kari (land buried with black coal like materials). \r\n<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">Farmers of Kuttanad have developed and mastered the spectacular technique of below sea level cultivation over 150 year ago. They made this system unique as it contributes remarkably well to the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services including several livelihood services for local communities.  [Source FAO, it was in news with respect to Kerala floods threatening this system]"
