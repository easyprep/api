  "answer": "2, 3 & 4 Only",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u>. The recommendations for Bharat Ratna are made by the Prime Minister to the President. <u>Second statement is correct</u>. The award cannot be used as a prefix or suffix to the recipient’s name. <u>Third statement is correct.</u> It can be awarded posthumously. <u>Fourth statement is correct</u>. The maximum number of people who can be awarded Bharat Ratna in a year is three. Bharat Ratna is the country’s highest civilian award instituted in 1954. It is given in recognition of exceptional service, performance of the highest order in any field of human endeavour. Nelson Mandela and Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan are the only two non-Indian personalities to have received the Bharat Ratna award. Earlier it was given only to living personalities but in 1966 the criterion was changed and it was awarded posthumously. The first recipients of the Bharat Ratna were politician C. Rajagopalachari, philosopher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, and scientist C.V Raman."
