  "question": "The Mumbai cityâ€™s healthcare sector is facing an increased demand for the Bombay Blood Group. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>This blood group is more common in South Asia than in rest of the world.</li>\r\n<li>It is also known as the O group blood.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe Bombay Blood Group is one of the rarest of blood groups. It was discovered in Mumbai in 1952. Globally it is rarer than in South Asia. This is attributed to inbreeding and close community marriages. India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh have higher occurrence of the blood group due to shared ancestry.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nBombay blood group is not the same as O type blood group. While the H antigen is present in O type blood, it is absent in the Bombay blood group. The antigens present in the blood cell determine the blood that can be received or donated during blood transfusions. Its rarity makes it hard for people with this blood group to receive transfusions in case of accidents."
