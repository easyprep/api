  "option3": "Liquified nitrogen",
  "option4": "Liquified hydrogen",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Solid carbon dioxide",
  "explanation": "Dry ice is the solid form of carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide gas is pressurized and cooled to form liquid CO2. The liquid carbon dioxide is injected into either a block press or pelletizer. It is used primarily as a cooling agent. <br />The most common use of dry ice is to preserve food, using non-cyclic refrigeration. It is frequently used to package items that must remain cold or frozen, such as ice cream or biological samples, without the use of mechanical cooling."
