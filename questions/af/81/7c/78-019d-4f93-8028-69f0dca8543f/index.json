The toolbox can be used by countries to assess drought risks in their regions much in advance, and prepare to deal with the water scarcity. It uses 30 parameters such as soil moisture, rainfall data and temperature data of the present and past. The drought â€“forecasting toolbox can accurately evaluate the vulnerability of different geographic regions to drought."
