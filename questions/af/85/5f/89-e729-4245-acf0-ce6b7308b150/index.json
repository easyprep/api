  "question": "Which of the following statements is/are correct about Sulfur dioxide? <ol> <li>It is one of the major pollutants that create acid rain</li> <li>It is one of the pollutants used to measure the air quality index (AQI).</li> <li>It is produced predominantly when coal is burned to generate electricity.</li> <li>It is one of the greenhouse gases under Kyoto protocol</li> </ol> Select the correct option from codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "option3": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option4": "Only 1, 2 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Recently, a US led university study found that China’s sulphur dioxide emissions have fallen by 75 percent since 2007, while India’s emissions increased by 50 percent. The results suggest that India very soon become the world’s top emitter of Sulfur dioxide, an air pollutant that causes acid rain, haze and many health-related problems. It is produced predominantly when coal is burned to generate electricity. The study was published in the journal Scientific Reports on November 9, 2017. The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement linked to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which commits its Parties by setting internationally binding emission reduction targets. Kyoto protocol covers a target to reduce the emission of six greenhouse gases viz. carbon-dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). Thus the list does not include sulphur dioxide. Therefore fourth statement is incorrect. There are six AQI categories, namely Good, Satisfactory, Moderately polluted, Poor, Very Poor, and Severe. The Air Quality Index (AQI) considers eight pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, NH3, and Pb). Acid rain results when sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) are emitted into the atmosphere and transported by wind and air currents."
