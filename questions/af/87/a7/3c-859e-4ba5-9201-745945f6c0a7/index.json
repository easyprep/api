  "question": "The evidence for the rotation of stars comes mainly from which of the following effects?",
  "option1": "Doppler effect",
  "option2": "Photoelectric effect",
  "option3": "Stark effect",
  "option4": "Zeeman effect",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Zeeman effect",
  "explanation": "The evidence for the rotation of stars comes mainly from the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman effect, named after the Dutch physicist Pieter Zeeman, is the effect of splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of a static magnetic field. It is analogous to the Stark effect, the splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of an electric field."
