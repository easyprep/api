  "question": "The constitution of India derives its ultimate authority from ____?",
  "option1": "Supreme Court of India",
  "option2": "Parliament of India",
  "option3": "People of India",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "People of India",
  "explanation": "The Constitution draws its authority from the people and has been promulgated in the name of the people. This is evident from the Preamble which states “<em>We the people of India …. do hereby adopt, enact and give to ourselves this Constitution.”</em> This implies that the direct authority of the people cannot be claimed or usurped by the legislature. Under the constitution, legislature is a representative body but people constitute the ultimate sovereign."
