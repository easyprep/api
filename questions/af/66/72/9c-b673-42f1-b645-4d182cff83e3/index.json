  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "First statement is incorrect because the constitutional provision as per Article 222 is that the President, after consultation with the Chief Justice of India, may transfer a judge from one High Court to any other High Court. Second statement is correct because as per article 124(2), president appoints every judge of the Supreme Court after consultation with judges of the Supreme Court and of the high courts as the president may deem necessary. Similarly, as per article 217(1), every judge of a High Court is appointed by the President after consultation with the Chief Justice of India, the Governor of the state, and the Chief Justice of the concerned High Court."
