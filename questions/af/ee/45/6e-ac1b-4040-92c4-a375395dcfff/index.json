  "question": "Which of the following gases is/are used in the Modified Atmospheric Packaging of food products?<br> 1. Oxygen<br> 2. Carbon dioxide<br> 3. Nitrogen<br> 4. Ethane<br> Chose the correct answer from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The atmosphere in an MA package consists of Nitrogen, Oxygen and Carbon dioxide. It is the altered ration of these gases that prolongs the shelf life. By reducing the oxygen level and increasing the carbon dioxide level ripening of the fruits and vegetables can be delayed, respiration and ethylene production rates can be retarded and various compositional changes associated with ripening can be slowed down."
