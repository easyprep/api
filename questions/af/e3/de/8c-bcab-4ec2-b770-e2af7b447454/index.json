Capital markets are long term funds with minimum maturity more than a year.<br> National Saving Certificates have a lock-in of 5 years and 10 years, and hence cannot be included in money markets.Treasury bills have maximum maturity period of 91 days, 182 days, 273 days or 364 days i.e less than 1 year, and hence they are included under the money markets. Also, note that that money markets increases the short term liquidity in the market whereas; capital markets are mobilisation of savings."
