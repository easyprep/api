  "answer": "Equatorial Guinea and Gabon",
  "explanation": "The Komo is a river of Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. It flows for 230 kilometres. It rises in Equatorial Guinea in the southwestern part of the Woleu-Ntem plateau. However much of its watershed is in the territory of Gabon. The largest tributary of the River Komo is the Mbeya River. Its course is disturbed by geological barriers that produce waterfalls as those at Tchimbele and Kinguele. They are potential hydroelectric power sources for Libreville, the capital city of Gabon."
