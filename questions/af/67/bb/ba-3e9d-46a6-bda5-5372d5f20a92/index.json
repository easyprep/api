  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nTarchen is a prayer flag. It is traditionally hoisted during the Losar (Tibetan New Year) and also during other celebrations. Tarchen or Darchen is derived from the terms ‘dar’ meaning flag and ‘chen’ meaning big. It was recently hoisted at the Losar celebrations of Ladakh.\r\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe Tarchen flags are hoisted in a vertical orientation unlike most flags. They are rectangular pieces of cloth, often in primary colors and bearing Buddhist prayers. The hoisting of the Tarchen flag is said to mark the beginning of the new year."
