  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct. Second statement is incorrect because Hybrid Annuity Model is not associated with banking; in fact, it is associated with infrastructure financing by government. Till now, road projects in India were awarded via one of the three models: Build-Operate Transfer (BOT)-Annuity, BOT-Toll, and EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contract. HAM is a mix between the existing two models â€“ BOT Annuity and EPC. As per this model, the government will contribute to 40% of the project cost in the first five years through annual payments (hybrid annuity) which means the first 40% payment is made as fixed amount in five equal instalments whereas the remaining 60% will be paid as variable annuity amount after the completion of the project on the basis of assets created."
