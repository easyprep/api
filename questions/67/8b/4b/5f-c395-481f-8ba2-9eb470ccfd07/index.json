  "option3": "adopt actions to mitigate earthquake damage risk in the Himalayan region",
  "option4": "prevent and combat the global threat of money laundering and terrorist financing",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "extract carbon dioxide from sea water to produce a new liquid fuel",
  "explanation": "Project Foghorn aims to extract carbon dioxide from seawater to produce a new liquid fuel similar to conventional fuels used nowadays; it aims to reduce carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Seawater contains good amount of carbon dioxide that has been naturally absorbed from the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. The dissolved carbon in sea water can be separated from electrochemical processes, which could then be combined to make hydrocarbons for liquid fuel: a clean &ldquo;sea fuel&rdquo;. A new technique called solid oxide electrolyser cell (SOEC), is being used to break apart steam into hydrogen and oxygen and to collect the residual carbon."
