  "question": "In reference to the recent CAG report on the condition of the Indian soldiers on the Siachen Glacier, consider the following statements about this region:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is the highest battleground in the world.</li>\n<li>It is the source of the Indus River.</li>\n<li>Even biodegradable wastes cannot degrade on the Siachen.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Siachen Glacier is the highest battleground in the world. The region is disputed between India and Pakistan but is controlled by India. It is located in Ladakh, on the Karakoram Range. It has an altitude of 5,753m from sea level.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe glacial meltwater from the Siachen Glacier is the major water source of the Indus River. The glacier feeds the Nubra River, which flows into the Shyok River, which in turn feeds the Indus River. The wastes disposed in the region is a major source of pollution for these rivers which irrigate a large land expanse.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nThe Siachen Glacier has high altitude and extreme weather conditions. The very low temperatures and sparse oxygen at that altitude retards growth of normal microbes that help in biodegradation. This makes even the biodegradable wastes a source of concern in the region, apart from the non-degradable wastes like ammunition and heavy metal debris."
