  "option4": "None of the above statements are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "It's an indigenous method for harvesting storm water by using straw",
  "explanation": "Bhungroo is an indigenous method for harvesting storm water by using straw. This technology is most prevalent in arid parts of Gujarat. The technology developed by Biplab Paul, supplies abundant water in the dry months and also lessens the salt content in the soil. The technology ensures that floodwater seeps through straw into a pipe that carries it to an underground well. The density of stormwater being lower than that of the water already present in the aquifer, it stays above. Additionally, the salinity of land above is reduced and the salt is carried below and sinks, leaving fresh water available for use during cropping months. Bhungroo works for one-tenth the cost of borewell recharge technology. Bhungroo is typical owned and managed by women."
