It was built between 1976 and 1985 and it generates approximately 15% of the country's power. The dam's construction was very controversial and displaced many indigenous Maya Achi peoples. Government forced relocations resulted in the Rio Negro massacres which claimed up to 5,000 lives between 1980 and 1982.",
