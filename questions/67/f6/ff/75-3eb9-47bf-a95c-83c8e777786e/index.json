  "question": "With reference to the study on the causes of coral bleaching in Indian and Pacific Ocean published in Nature Climate Change, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The reefs in Andaman and Nicobar suffer worse bleaching than those in the Lakshadweep Islands.</li>\n<li>Andaman and Nicobar Islands are coral islands while the Lakshadweep Islands are volcanic islands.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe study found that the geographical location of the corals played a major role in the extent of bleaching. The closer the corals were to East African Coast, more they bleached. The Lakshadweep corals were found to be more bleached than the Andaman and Nicobar corals.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Lakshadweep Island are coral islands. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are volcanic islands. The corals in Lakshadweep Island showed a lower mortality level during the 2016 El Nino event than during the previous events. This is because they have become acclimatised to the new conditions and adapted accordingly."
