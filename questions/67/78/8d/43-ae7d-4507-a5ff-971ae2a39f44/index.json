  "question": "The speed of the current is 5 km/hr. A motorboat goes 10 km upstream and back again to the starting point in 50 minutes. The speed (in km/hr) of the motorboat in still water is :",
  "option1": 20,
  "option2": 26,
  "option3": 25,
  "option4": 28,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 25,
  "explanation": "Let the speed of motorboat in still water be x km/hr. \r\n$latex \\\\therefore \\\\frac{10}{x-5}+\\\\frac{10}{x+5} = \\\\frac{50}{60}&s=1$\r\n$latex => 10\\\\left ( \\\\frac{x+5+x-5}{(x+5)(x-5)} \\\\right )= \\\\frac{5}{6}&s=1$\r\n$latex => 20x\\\\times 6 = (x^{2}-25)\\\\times 5$\r\n$latex => x^{2}-24x-25 = 0$\r\n$latex => x^{2}-25x+x-25 = 0$\r\n$latex => x(x-25)+1(x-25)= 0$\r\n$latex => (x-25)(x+1) = 0$\r\n$latex => x = 25$\r\nHence speed of motorboat in still water is 25 km/hr.\r\nHence option [C] is correct answer."
