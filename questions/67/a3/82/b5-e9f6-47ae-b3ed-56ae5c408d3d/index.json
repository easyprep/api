She will take charge as the head of Britain\\'s top judging panel in September following the retirement of current President, Lord Neuberger. She has served as Neuberger\\'s deputy since 2013. Three new justices have also been appointed to the Supreme Court - Lady Justice Black, Lord Justice Lloyd Jones and Lord Justice Brigg - who will take up the role when Lady Hale is sworn in officially as President on 2nd October. The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal for civil cases in the UK, and criminal cases from England, Northern Ireland and Wales - which means it considers cases where an order had already been made in a lower court and is being challenged."
