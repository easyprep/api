  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",

However, the Palestinians will not be allowed to have a standing army. They are also to disband Hamas and give up violent resistance against Israel.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Middle East Plan does not call for the division of Jerusalem. It is to remain with Israel as its sovereign capital. The Palestinians are to occupy the eastern neighbourhood beyond the security barrier as their capital.
