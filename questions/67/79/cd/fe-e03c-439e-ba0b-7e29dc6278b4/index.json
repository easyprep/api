  "option3": "New Zealand",
  "option4": "UK",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Japan",
  "explanation": "On 1st July 2019, Japan officially resumed commercial whaling after more than 30 years of limiting whale hunts to scientific purposes — a policy that still resulted in the deaths of hundreds of whales every year.  The hunts come after Japan’s withdrawal from the International Whaling Commission (IWC). The move is slammed by anti-whaling activists but welcomed by Japanese whaling communities. Now, Japan has joined Iceland and Norway as the only nations to allow commercial whaling despite the IWC moratorium. Hunting will reportedly be limited to Japan\\'s territorial sea and exclusive economic zone, which stretches about 200 nautical miles (370 kilometers) from the nation\\'s coasts.  The IWC, established in 1946, to conserve and manage the world’s whale and cetacean population, introduced a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986."
