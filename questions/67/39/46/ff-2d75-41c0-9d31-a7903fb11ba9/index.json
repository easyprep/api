  "question": "A pipe can fill a tank in x hours and another can empty it in y hours. In how many hours they can together fill it (where y > x) :",
  "option1": "$latex x-y\\ hours$",
  "option2": "$latex y-x\\ hours$",
  "option3": "$latex \\frac{xy}{y-x}\\ hours&s=1$",
  "option4": "$latex \\frac{xy}{x-y}\\ hours&s=1$",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "$latex \\frac{xy}{y-x}\\ hours&s=1$",
  "explanation": "When both pipes are opened simultaneously, part of the tank filled in 1 hour\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{1}{x}-\\\\frac{1}{y}=\\\\frac{y-x}{xy}&s=1$\r\nâˆ´ Required time $latex = \\\\frac{xy}{y-x}\\\\ hours&s=1$\r\nHence option [C] is correct answer."
