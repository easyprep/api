  "explanation": "On June 23, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has formally opened its new headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, exactly 125 years after the Olympic Games were revived. The new headquarters costs 145  million Swiss francs ($145 million). The Olympic House has been built on the site of the former headquarters, and 95% of the old materials were reused and recycled. The signature feature is a central staircase linking together the five Olympic rings. Designed by architecture firm 3XN of Denmark, the energy-efficient building has won international awards for sustainability. Renewable energy is provided using solar panels on the roof and pumps taking water from Lake Geneva. It also brings around 500 IOC employees under one roof."
