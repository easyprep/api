  "explanation": "Ordos Loop is actually a geographical feature of the Ordos Plateau in north-west China. Yellow River causes a rectangular bend, in the form of a \"loop\", while flowing through the Ordos Plateau. This flow results in the formation of a highland basin which further leads to the development of the Ordos Plateau, also known as the Ordos Basin. It is China's second-largest sedimentary basin."
