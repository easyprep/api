  "question": "Consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>A chromosome consists of DNA, which consists of genes</li>\r\n<li>Most of the human DNA codes for proteins</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above is / are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "The entire chromosome consists of DNA. However, less than 3% of the DNA actually consists of genes. There are thought to be about 30,000 genes in humans. Less than 3% of human DNA codes for proteins. Most of the DNA in eukaryotic chromosomes consists of repetitive sequences that never get transcribed."
