Great Rift Valley of East Africa lead to the formation of Afar Triple Junction which further leads to the formation of a geological depression called Afar Triangle or Afar Depression. This depression houses Lake Assal of Djibouti, the lowest point on land in the continent of Africa and River Awash of Ethiopia. Danakil Depression lies to the north of this depression. Djibouti is positioned on a plain known as the Afar Triple Junction in which the three divergent segments of the east Africa-the African, Somalian and Arabian Plates are tearing away from each other."
