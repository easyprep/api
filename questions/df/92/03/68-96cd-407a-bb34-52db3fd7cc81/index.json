  "question": "What percentage of carbon is present in steel?",
  "option1": "0.0 to 2.5",
  "option2": "2.5 to 5.0",
  "option3": "5.0 to 7.5",
  "option4": "7.5 to 10.0",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "0.0 to 2.5",
  "explanation": "<p>Steel is an alloy made by combining iron and other elements, the most common of these being carbon. When carbon is used, its content in the steel is between 0.2% and 2. 1% by weight, depending on the grade. Other alloying elements sometimes used are manganese, chromium, vanadium and tungsten. Carbon and other elements act as a hardening agent, preventing dislocations in the iron atom crystal lattice from sliding past one another.</p>"
