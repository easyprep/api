  "question": "In which year National Seed Policy was announced?",
  "option1": 2000,
  "option2": 2002,
  "option3": 2004,
  "option4": 2006,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 2002,
  "explanation": "Prior to the National Seed Policy 2002, the Government of India had adopted a “New Policy on Seed Development” in 1988 to remove the roadblocks in import of horticultural seeds and to allow import of limited quantity of seeds of course cereals, pulses and oilseeds. However, this policy was flawed due to nonexistence of IPR laws and several restrictions on import and exports.\r\nThus, the National Seed Policy 2002 was launched to – provide intellectual property protection to new varieties; usher this sector into planned development; protect the interest of farmers and encourage conservation of agro-biodiversity."
