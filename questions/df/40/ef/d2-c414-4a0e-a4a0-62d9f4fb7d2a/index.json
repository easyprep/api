  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",

  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Ocean Currents are responsible for moderate temperatures at coasts. e.g. North Atlantic Drift brings warmness to England. Canary cold current brings cooling effect to Spain, Portugal etc.<br />Mixing of cold and warm ocean currents bear richest fishing grounds in the world.<br />The mixing of warm and cold currents help to replenish the oxygen and favor the growth of planktons, the primary food for fish population. The best fishing grounds of the world exist mainly in these mixing zones."
