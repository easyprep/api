  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about raw materials as a determinant factor in the location of manufacturing industries?<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The influence of raw materials as a locative factor has declined in the 20th century due to the development in science and technology and fast transportation</li>\r\n<li>The development of an industry depends on the localized materials rather than the ubiquitous ones.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The availability of raw materials is frequently a major locational factor. It is particularly important in the initial stages of manufacturing.<br />However, the influence of raw materials as a locative factor has declined in the 20th century due to the development in science and technology and fast transportation and other reasons.Â <br />The development of an industry depends on the localized materials rather than the ubiquitous ones."
