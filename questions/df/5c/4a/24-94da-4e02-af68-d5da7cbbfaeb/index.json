  "answer": "Egypt and Sudan",
  "explanation": "Elba Mountain, also known as Gabal Elba, is a 1435 metres high peak located in the Halayeb Triangle land area of northeast Africa which is claimed by both Egypt and Sudan. De facto, the area, at present, is under the control of Egypt. Gabal Elba's summit is a \"mist oasis\" where much of the precipitation is contributed in the form of dew, mist and clouds, creating a unique ecosystem not found anywhere else in the country. Indeed, Gabal Elba is a \"biodiversity hotspot\", with a biological diversity unparalleled in any terrestrial environment in Egypt mainland. The relative abundance of moisture supports a diverse flora of some 458 plant species â€“ almost 25% of plant species recorded for the entire country."
