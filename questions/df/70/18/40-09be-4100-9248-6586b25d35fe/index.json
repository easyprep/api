This is the India’s fourth air base and the third naval air facility in the region that overlooks key sea lanes of communication and strategic points. INS Kohassa has been named after a White-Bellied Sea Eagle, which is a large bird of prey, endemic to A&N islands. The new airbase will be used for both Defence and civil aircraft. Earlier, Naval Air Station at Shibpur was manned by utilizing the manpower from INS Utkrosh. Now, the airbase will function as an independent unit. The airbase will be used to handle operations of helicopters and small aircraft like the Dornier."
