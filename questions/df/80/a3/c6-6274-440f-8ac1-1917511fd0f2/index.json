  "question": "Consider the following:<br> 1. Wind energy<br> 2. Solar power<br> 3. Biomass power<br> 4. Small hydropower<br> The correct descending order of country&#8217;s installed capacity of above is:",
  "option1": "1, 3, 4, 2",
  "option2": "1, 4, 3, 2",
  "option3": "4, 1, 3, 2",
  "option4": "4, 2, 3, 1",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 4, 3, 2",
  "explanation": "Wind energy accounts for around 70 per cent of installed capacity (17.4 GW) and is the fastest growing programme with the investment almost entirely coming through private sector investments. It is followed by small hydropower (3.4 GW), biomass power (3.2 GW) and solar power (941 MW) that has just started registering its presence."
