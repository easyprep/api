  "answer": "Tetra Ethyl Lead",
  "explanation": "Tetra Ethyl Lead (TEL) is one such component that is added to petrol to reduce its tendency to `ping’ under compression. TEL breaks down to lead at upper cylinder temperatures. Lead atoms spread around and combining with the free radicals and slowing down the reaction.\r\nHowever, `Leaded’ petrol was a grave danger to the environment, as lead is a poison when it is absorbed into the body."
