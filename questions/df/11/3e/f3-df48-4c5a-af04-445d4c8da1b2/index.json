  "question": "Indiaâ€™s first roll on- roll off (Ro-Ro) vessel passenger service has been proposed to be started in which state?",
  "option1": "Andhra Pradesh",
  "option2": "Gujarat",
  "option3": "West Bengal",
  "option4": "Odisha",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Gujarat",
  "explanation": "Gujarat&#8217;sÂ DahejÂ is all set to get India&#8217;s first roll on-roll off (Ro-Ro) vessel passengerÂ ferry servicesÂ around April 2017. The Rs 550 crore projects being executed by theÂ GujaratÂ Maritime Board (GMB), and is expected to bring down travel time between Saurashtra regions inÂ GujaratÂ with its Southern parts significantly. From Ghoga in Saurashtra to Dahej in South Gujarat takes around 10-12 hours for trucks and buses, and even by cars it is not less than 6-8 hours. Once the Ro-Ro ferry service commences, this time would be dramatically shortened to one and a half hours. Roll-on/roll-offÂ (ROROÂ orÂ ro-ro)Â shipsÂ are vessels designed to carry wheeledÂ cargo, such asÂ cars,Â trucks,Â semi-trailer trucks,Â trailers, andÂ railroad cars that are driven on and off the ship on their own wheels or using a platform vehicle, such as aÂ self-propelled modular transporter. This is in contrast toÂ lift-on/lift-offÂ (Lolo) vessels, which use aÂ craneÂ to load and unload cargo. Roll-on/Roll-off or &#8216;Ro-Ro&#8217; services for freight transport have being proposed to be introduced at five places &#8211; Kolkata, Sahibganj, Varanasi, Patna and Bhagalpur besides setting up small terminals at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore."
