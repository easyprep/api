  "question": "Which of the following is / are features of the Doldrums? <ol><li>Weak horizontal movement of air</li><li>Low Pressure on ground</li><li>Presence around equator</li></ol> Select the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1& 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The equatorial area is a region of high temperature. Due to intense heating, the atmosphere heats up, expands and becomes lighter. Hence, the air starts rising vertically, causing low pressure on the ground. The horizontal movement of wind in this belt is very feeble. It is, therefore, a calm belt, also known as doldrums."
