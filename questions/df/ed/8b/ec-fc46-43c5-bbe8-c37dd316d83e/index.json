  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "The atmosphere of the earth is not heated directly by the sun. The incoming energy  .i.e. insolation is mostly in the form of short-wave radiation. The earth absorbs short wave radiation during daytime and reflects back the heat received into space as long-wave radiation which is mostly infrared radiation during night."
