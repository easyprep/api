  "question": "&nbsp; Consider the following statements about Savannah&nbsp;biome: <ol> <li>The region is characterized by long rainy season and short dry season with annual rainfall of about 100 cm</li> <li>The region is prone to frequent forest fires which prevent the growth of most trees</li> </ol> &nbsp;&nbsp; Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Savannas are characterized by two seasons: rainy and dry. During the rainy season which lasts for six to eight months, 50 to 127 centimeters of rain falls. The forest fires are common in Savannahs also&nbsp;but that is&nbsp;mainly because of human interference and not because of the natural reasons as the lightning in case of Taiga Biome. In Taiga, usually the forest fires are crown fires which destroy the canopy, but in Savannahs, these fires are usually confined to the herbaceous layer and do little long term damage to mature trees. These fires either kill or suppress tree seedlings, thus preventing the establishment of a continuous tree canopy which would prevent further grass growth."
