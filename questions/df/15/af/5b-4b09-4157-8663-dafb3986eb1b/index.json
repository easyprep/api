  "question": "The LCM of two numbers is 520 and their HCF is 4. If one of the number is 52, then the other number is :",
  "option1": 40,
  "option2": 42,
  "option3": 50,
  "option4": 52,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 40,
  "explanation": "âˆµ First Number $latex \\\\times$ Second Number = HCF $latex \\\\times$ LCM\r\n=> 52 $latex \\\\times$ Second Number = 4 $latex \\\\times$ 520\r\n$latex => Second\\\\ Number\\\\ = \\\\frac{4\\\\times 520}{52} = 40&s=1$\r\nHence option [A] is correct answer."
