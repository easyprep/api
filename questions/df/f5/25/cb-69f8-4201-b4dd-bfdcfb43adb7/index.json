  "question": "Mithun (Bos frontalis) is: <ol> <li>a bovine species indigeneous to South India</li> <li>considered to have evolved from wild Indian gaur</li> <li>known for producing nutritionally superior milk than cow or goat&nbsp;<em>milk</em>.</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because the bovine species is indigenous to the south-eastern parts of the Himalayas and the adjacent mountain ranges in north-east India. <u>Second statement is correct</u> because this bovine species, which is very little known elsewhere, is believed to have originated from the Gaur (Bos gauris). (The animal was in news when Arunachal Pradesh Governor Jyoti Prasad Rajkhowa declared <strong>Law and order failure</strong>&nbsp;in the State, when he saw a mithun being slaughtered outside Raj Bhavan, and recommended President&rsquo;s rule in Arunachal).<br> <u>Third statement is correct</u> because the species though produced less in quantity milk, is of high quality and can be used for preparation of various milk products."
