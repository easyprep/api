  "question": "Which of the following Kingdoms were associated with the life of the Buddha? <br>1. Avanti <br>2. Gandhara <br>3. Kosala <br>4. Magadha <br>Select the correct answer using the code given below:",
  "option1": "1, 2 and 3",
  "option2": "2 and 4",
  "option3": "3 and 4 only",
  "option4": "1, 3 and 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "3 and 4 only",
  "explanation": "Avanti was not directly related to life of Buddha, so this needs to be opted out. We have read that Pasenadi (Prasenajit), king of Kosala, was the Buddhaâ€™s contemporary and is frequently mentioned in Pali texts. Kosala and Magadha were linked through matrimonial ties. Buddha wandered through the towns and villages in the kingdoms of Kosala and Magadha teaching his philosophy. Gandhara is not directly associated with the life of Buddha. It was expansion of Maurya empire that Gandhara received much Buddhist influence, notably during the reign of Asoka."
