  "answer": "Eswatini",
  "explanation": "Hlane Royal National Park is Eswatini's largest protected area and park. Hlane Royal National Park was proclaimed as a National Park in 1967, following Mlilwane Wildlife Sanctuary (1961), under the instruction of King Sobhuza ll. \"Hlane\" is the siSwati name for 'wilderness'. This park hosts the traditional Butimba or royal hunt, and today Big Game Parks manages Hlane on behalf of the King. Among a wealth of wildlife reintroduced to its former home, elephant, white rhino, lion and leopard all occur. The rhino and elephant often visit the waterhole at Ndlovu Camp, while lions – the emblem of royal Eswatini – occupy a separate fenced area."
