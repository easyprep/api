  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",

  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "Cyclone is any low-pressure area with winds spiralling inwards. Cyclones rotate anti-clockwise in Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in Southern Hemisphere. <br />The Coriolis force is zero at the equator hence there are no cyclones at equator.<br />About 65 per cent of cyclonic activity occurs between 10° and 20° latitude."
