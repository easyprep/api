  "option3": "1, 2,3 & 4",
  "option4": "2 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 & 4",
  "explanation": "Kindly note that Implementation of safeguards for protection of Scheduled Castes is not something which NCSC has to do. As per article 338(5) it is the duty of the chairperson of NCSC to investigate and monitor all matters relating to the safeguards provided for the Scheduled Castes, which are in force or are under the Government Order. Implementation and Monitoring the implementation are two different things. So first statement is INCORRECT. The second statement - Evaluate progress of development of Scheduled castes is correct. The third statement is NOT correct because it is NOT mandatory to create and submit an annual report, the report can be prepared at a time which the commission thinks fit, The fourth statement is correct. NCSC has all the powers of a civil court trying a suit. (Article 338 (5) and (8))"
