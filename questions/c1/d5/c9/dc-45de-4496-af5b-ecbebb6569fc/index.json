  "question": "With reference to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ‘Special Report’, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Cryosphere is the portion of Earth’s water that is in solid form.</li>\r\n<li>India has permafrost features.</li>\r\n<li>Permafrost occurs only at higher latitudes.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option2": "All are correct",
  "option3": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "option4": "All are incorrect",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe report has focused on the effect of climate change on cryosphere. This term is used to denote all of earth’s water that is in the form of solid. This includes snow, lake ice, river ice, glaciers, ice sheets, ice caps, etc. The report predicts the extremes of too much water (floods) and water scarcity around the world.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nPermafrost refers to geological features like rock, land etc. that remain below the freezing temperature of water for several years. Thawing permafrost is a global concern. The report says that 30% of northern hemisphere’s permafrost would melt by the century’s end. In India, permafrost occurs in regions like Himachal Pradesh and Ladakh.\r\n<strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThough most of the permafrost occurs at higher latitudes, they can also occur at high elevations. Thawing of permafrost will release billions of tonnes of carbon and can cause glacial lake outburst flooding(GLOF). This would accelerate climate change. While most of the studies on permafrost is conducted in European Alps, those in regions like India have not received sufficient focus. The Indian government is studying permafrost in the Himalayan region."
