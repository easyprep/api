Interestingly, this survey ignored any financial performances like P&L statements and balance sheets in favour of a customer\\'s opinion. The survey compiled data from around 40,000 customers around the world for their opinions on their banking relationships. The banks were rated on the basis of 5 key attributes - trust, digital services, financial advice and fees."
