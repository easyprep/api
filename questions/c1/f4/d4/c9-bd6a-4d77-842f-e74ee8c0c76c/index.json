  "question": "With reference to the discussions surrounding the right to internet access, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Internet access is a part of article 19 of the constitution.</li>\n<li>UN defined internet access as a privilege.</li>\n<li>The UNHRC resolution against intentional disruption of internet by the state is non-binding.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Only 3 is correct",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nIn September, the Kerala High Court held that access to internet is a part of right to education and right to privacy as given by article 19. The court also held that restriction on mobile phone use amounted to violation of the right to freedom of speech and expression as provided by article 21.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nUnited Nations defines access to internet as a human right. This was declared so in 2016. Traditionally, internet access was considered a privilege- something enjoyed by a select group of people. Declaring it a right implies that the internet has become essential for a person to live a normal life.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nThe UN resolution passed in 2016 declares the right to express oneself on the internet as a universal right and the states must not block a personâ€™s access to the internet. The resolution is not legally binding. Several countries like China and Russia had opposed it."
