  "answer": "Germany",
  "explanation": "Germany passed the \"Enabling Act of 1933\" that gave formal legal sanction to dictatorship. The Enabling Act of 1933, was a law that gave the German Cabinet—in effect, the Chancellor—the power to enact laws without the involvement of the Reichstag and to override fundamental aspects of the Weimar Constitution. The Enabling Act gave Hitler plenary powers and followed on the heels of the Reichstag Fire Decree, which had abolished most civil liberties and transferred state powers to the Reich government. The combined effect of the two laws was to transform Hitler's government into a legal dictatorship."
