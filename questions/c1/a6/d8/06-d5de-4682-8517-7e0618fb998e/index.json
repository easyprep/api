  "question": "Which of the following women scientists has won the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry?",
  "option1": "Christiane Volhard",
  "option2": "Ada Yonath",
  "option3": "Frances H. Arnold",
  "option4": "Carol W. Greider",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Frances H. Arnold",
  "explanation": "The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2018 with one half to Frances H. Arnold “for the directed evolution of enzymes” and the other half jointly to George P. Smith and British scientist Sir Gregory P. Winter \\\"for the phage display of peptides and antibodies\\\". Dr. Arnold and Dr. Smith are American scientists. Now, Dr. Arnold is only the fifth woman to be awarded the prize for chemistry. The methods developed by the laureates have been put to work to create new enzymes and antibodies used in promoting a greener chemicals industry, mitigating disease and saving lives. The prize highlights the narrowing of the gap between biology and some fields of chemistry as chemists turn to nature for inspiration."
