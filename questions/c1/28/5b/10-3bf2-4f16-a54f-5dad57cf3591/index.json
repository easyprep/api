  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "Article 316 makes it clear that Chairman and other members of a Public Service Commission shall be appointed as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>President - for UPSC and Joint Public Service Commission</li>\r\n<li>GovernorÂ  - for state public service commission</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Are Public servants only made members of Public service Commission? </strong> No but Article 316 says that around 50% of the members of every Public Service Commission shall be persons with minimum 10 years experience under Government of India or under the Government of a State.Article 317 deals with the removal of the Chairman or any other member of a Public Service Commission. Please note that thought the chairman and members of UPSC / JPSC are appointed by President and State PSCs by Governor, the removal of chairman or any member of even a state Public Service Commission can be done ONLY by President. They can be removed from office by order of the President on the ground of misbehaviour after the Supreme Court, on reference being made to it by the President, has, on inquiry held in accordance with the procedure prescribed in that behalf under article 145, reported that the Chairman or such other member, as the case may be, ought on any such ground to be removed."
