  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe PFMS is an end-to-end platform for processing payments, transfers, monitoring, reporting, etc. It is implemented by the Controller General of Accounting. This office is different from the CAG, which is an independent constitutional body. The CGA is under the finance ministry.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe PFMS is used for direct benefit transfers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. The platform has introduced efficiency and transparency in the benefit transfer process and reduced leakages. The linking of the farmer accounts is in context with the upcoming paddy procurement."
