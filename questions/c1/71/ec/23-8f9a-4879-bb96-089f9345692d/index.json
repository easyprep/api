  "explanation": "M C Mary Kom, the five-time world champion and Olympic bronze-medallist, has become the first Indian to be picked as the International Boxing Association\\'s (AIBA) representative for the IOC Athletes\\' Forum scheduled in November 2017. She has been invited to attend the 8th International Olympic Committee\\'s (IOC) Athletes\\' Forum in Lausanne from November 11th to 13th. Regarding to this, AIBA has sent an invitation letter to the Boxing Federation of India (BFI). However, the event overlaps with the Asian Championship in Vietnam, which is scheduled from November 2 to 12. If Mary Kom is selected for the tournament after trials later this month, her participation at the IOC event would become uncertain."
