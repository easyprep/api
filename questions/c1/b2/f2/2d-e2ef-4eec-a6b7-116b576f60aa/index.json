  "question": "Which country has recently declared polio-free country by the World Health Organization (WHO)?",
  "option1": "Pakistan",
  "option2": "Gabon",
  "option3": "Afghanistan",
  "option4": "Nigeria",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Gabon",
  "explanation": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially declared Gabon a \\\"polio-free country\\\" because of lack of new reported or suspected cases in the central African country. Polio is a highly-infectious viral disease which mainly affects young children and can result in permanent paralysis. There is no cure and it can only be prevented through immunization. The cases of polio have decreased by 99% since 1988, when polio was endemic in 125 countries and 350,000 cases were recorded worldwide. Now the disease is endemic only in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where the WHO recorded four cases this yearâ€”two in each country. Last year, there were 37 cases globally."
