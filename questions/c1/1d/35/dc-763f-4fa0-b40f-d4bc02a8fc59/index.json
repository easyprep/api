  "option2": 1683,
  "option3": 1689,
  "option4": 1697,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 1683,
  "explanation": "On 9 August 1683, King Charles II had granted a new charter empowering the company to set up courts. Under this provision, a new court was established 10 July 1686 and it was called admiralty court, in which a qualified lawyer was to work as judge-advocate. This court practically became the general court, not confined merely to maritime and admiralty cases proper as was envisaged by the charter. It exercised a much wider jurisdiction and dispensed justice in all cases-civil, criminal, maritime and mercantile. It practically relieved the governor and council from the judicial work."
