  "question": "&nbsp;Consider the following differences between plant cell and animal cell: <ol> <li>While plastids are usually present in plant cells, they are absent in animal cells</li> <li>While lysosomes are rare in plant cells, they are found in almost all animal cells</li> </ol> &nbsp;Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "A&nbsp;lysosome&nbsp;is a membrane-bound&nbsp;organelle&nbsp;found in nearly all animal&nbsp;cells. They are spherical&nbsp;vesicles&nbsp;which contain hydrolytic&nbsp;enzymes&nbsp;that can break down virtually all kinds of&nbsp;bio molecules. Besides degradation of polymers, the lysosome is involved in various cell processes, including secretion,&nbsp;plasma membrane&nbsp;repair,&nbsp;cell signalling, and&nbsp;energy metabolism. Plastids are thought to have originated from&nbsp;end symbiotic&nbsp;cyan bacteria. They are responsible for colour."
