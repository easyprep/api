  "explanation": "The Generalized System of Preference (GSP) is the largest and oldest US trade preference programme and is designed to promote economic development by allowing duty-free entry for thousands of products from designated beneficiary countries. Recently, it is in news because a group of 25 influential American lawmakers has urged the US Trade Representative - Robert Lighthizer - not to terminate the GSP programme after the expiry of the 60-day notice on 3rd May 2019. They   argued that terminating GSP for India would hurt American companies seeking to expand their exports to India. They also urged to continue negotiating a deal that protects and promotes jobs that rely on trade - both imports and exports - with India. President Donald Trump announced on March 4, the US intends to terminate India\\'s designations as a beneficiary developing country under the GSP programme."
