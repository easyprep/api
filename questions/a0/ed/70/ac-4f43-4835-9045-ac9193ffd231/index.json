  "answer": "Finland and Russia",
  "explanation": "Finland and Russia are the basin countries of the Vuoksi River. Vuoksi River is a river running through the northernmost part of the Karelian Isthmus from Lake Saimaa in southeastern Finland to Lake Ladoga in northwestern Russia. During both the Winter and Continuation War, the Vuoksi River was a major Finnish defensive line against the Soviet advance. The Mannerheim Line and VKT-Line were located along the northern shore of its Southern armlet. From the industrial revolution, the power generated from Vuoksi's rapids made the Vuoksi region Finland's industrial center in the late 19th century."
