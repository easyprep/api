  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The EBRD was founded in April 1991 during the dissolution of the Soviet Union with an aim to support countries of the former Eastern Bloc in the process of establishing their private sectors. It offers loans, equity and guarantees thereby promoting direct financing. EBRD mandates to work only in countries that are committed to democratic principles and it promotes environmentally sound and sustainable development. It does not finance \\\"defence-related activities; those related to tobacco industry; selected alcoholic products; and substances banned by international law and stand-alone gambling facilities. Recently, Union Cabinet approved India's Membership of European Bank for Reconstruction &amp; Development (EBRD). This would enhance Indiaâ€™s investment opportunities and further boost India's international profile and promote its economic interests."
