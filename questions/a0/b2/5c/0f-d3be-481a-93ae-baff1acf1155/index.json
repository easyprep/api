  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is correct</u>. Currently, there is no provision in the constitution that bars a state from having its own state flag. However, a state cannot declare its flag by itself and it requires approval from the Centre, specifically from Home Ministry. As of now, centre has not given approval for the official status of Karnataka’s state flag. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u>. Once the demand of Karnataka state government is accepted by the centre, the state will become the second state in the country to have its own state flag, the first being Jammu Kashmir. <u>Third statement is incorrect</u>. The unveiled flag has been named “Naada Dwaja”. The “Naada Dwaja” (state\\'s flag) has three strips of yellow, white and red colours respective, and has the state\\'s emblem “Gandaberunda” or the two-headed mythological bird, at its centre."
