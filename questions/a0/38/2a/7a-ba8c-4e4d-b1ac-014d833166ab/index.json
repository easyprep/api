  "option1": "2 only",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 and 3",
  "option4": "1 and 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nSection 144 of CrPC deals with unlawful assembly. This is different from curfew. Curfew is imposed in more severe situations, such as violence. While curfew imposes prohibition on individuals from venturing outdoors, section 144 does not. The orders under section 144 cannot be imposed for more than 2 months.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe CrPC section allows the government to block internet access. It also allows the blocking of mobile services and cable TV services. The government can also order the closing of public bodies like educational institutions. The section is enforced when the government feels the prevalence of chances of disturbance to public peace and security.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe section is imposed by the respective district magistrate. Public order is a state subject. The violation of the section invites prison term of 3 years. There are also provisions for penalising individuals who obstruct the police during their conduction of business and also those who abet the formation of unlawful assembly."
