  "explanation": "• The Sati Regulation act which banned the Sati practice in all jurisdictions of British India was passed on December 4, 1829 by the then Governor-General Lord William Bentinck.<br />• Lord Ripon is known to have granted the Indians first taste of freedom by introducing the Local Self Government in 1882. He led a series of enactments in which larger powers of the Local self government were given to the rural and urban bodies.<br />• The decision to affect the Partition of Bengal was announced on 19 July 1905 by the Viceroy of India, Curzon. The partition took place on 16 October 1905 and separated the largely Muslim eastern areas from the largely Hindu western areas.<br />• The doctrine of lapse was an annexation policy applied by the British East India Company in India. Many Indian states were annexed by Lord Dalhousie."
