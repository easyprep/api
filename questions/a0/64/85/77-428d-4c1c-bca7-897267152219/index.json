  "question": "Reports show that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation has been weakening over the past 15 years. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>AMOC is a system of jet streams in the Atlantic region.</li>\n<li>Weakening of the AMOC will decrease the salinity of the Atlantic Ocean.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe AMOC is a system of ocean currents in the Atlantic region that transport the warm waters from tropics to the temperate regions of North Atlantic. It is vital for distribution of energy across the ocean system and affects precipitation patterns.  \n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nA main reason for the weakening AMOC is the warming of Indian Ocean. This causes increased precipitation in the IOR which causes drawing of air towards the tropics. This will reduce precipitation in the Atlantic and will increase the salinity there."
