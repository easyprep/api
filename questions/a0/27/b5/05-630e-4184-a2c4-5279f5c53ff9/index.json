  "question": "What is the maximum life of an ordinance?",
  "option1": "Four months and six weeks",
  "option2": "Six months and six weeks",
  "option3": "Three months and three weeks",
  "option4": "One month and three weeks",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Six months and six weeks",
  "explanation": "An ordinance approved by both the Houses becomes an act. The ordinanceÂ  ceases to operate if Parliament takes no action, on the expiry of six weeks from the reassembly of Parliament. The ordinance may also cease to operate even earlier than the prescribed six weeks, if both the Houses of Parliament pass resolutions disapproving the same. If the Houses of Parliament are summoned to reassemble on different dates, the period of six weeks is calculated from the later of those dates. Therefore the maximum life of an ordinance can be six months and six weeks, if it is not approved by the Parliament."
