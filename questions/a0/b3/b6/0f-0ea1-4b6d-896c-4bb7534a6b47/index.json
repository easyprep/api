  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 Only",
  "explanation": "First statement is incorrect because the Smart Food Initiative is founded by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT). Second statement is also correct because Smart Food will be taken forward as a partnership and many organizations have already teamed up to popularize millets. In India, this includes the Indian Institute of Millet Research (IIMR), the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), MS Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) and the Self Employed Women&rsquo;s Association (SEWA). Millets and sorghum have been chosen as the first two Smart Foods under the initiative."
