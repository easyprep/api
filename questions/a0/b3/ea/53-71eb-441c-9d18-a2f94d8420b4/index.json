  "question": "Consider the following spacecrafts with planets to which they are associated: <ol> <li>Messenger spacecraft -  Mercury</li> <li>Cassini spacecraft -  Saturn</li> <li>Orion Spacecraft -  Mars</li> </ol> Which of the above is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Cassini&ndash;Huygens is an unmanned spacecraft sent to study the planet Saturn. Cassini reached the orbit of Saturn in 2004, and continues to operate as of May 2017. The Orion spacecraft is similar to NASA's Apollo capsule that carried astronauts to the moon in the 1960s and 1970s. The new spacecraft will play a major role in NASA's journey to Mars. Orion Spacecraft can travel to an asteroid or even Mars. To carry the spacecraft beyond low Earth orbit, NASA is developing a huge rocket called the Space Launch System, or SLS. This rocket is a heavy-lift launch vehicle. The first launch of the Orion spacecraft without crew or passengers is scheduled in November 2018. A second mission carrying astronauts is envisioned for August 2021. Messenger spacecraft was a NASA robotic spacecraft that orbited the planet Mercury between 2011 and 2015."
