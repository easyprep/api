  "question": "If the frequency of a sound wave is reduced to half of its original value, then the speed of sound wave will:<br> &nbsp;",
  "option1": "reduce to half of its original value",
  "option2": "double to that of its original value",
  "option3": "increase fourfold of its original value",
  "option4": "remain same",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "reduce to half of its original value",
  "explanation": "The frequency and wavelength formulas of sound waves is given as follows:<br> <img src=\"http://www.gktoday.in/wp-content/uploads-back/2016/02/speed-frequency-wavelength.jpg\">. In the above, Greek letter lambda &lambda; is the symbol for wavelength."
