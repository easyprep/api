  "option1": "will increase CO2 solubility in Ocean water",
  "option2": "will stimulate phytoplankton bloom",
  "option3": "will suppress the growth of phytoplankton",
  "option4": "will stimulate the growth of fishes and zooplankton",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "will stimulate phytoplankton bloom",
  "explanation": "This question is based upon the concept of Iron fertilization, whereby introduction of iron to the upper ocean to stimulate a phytoplankton bloom is adopted. Like all plants, phytoplankton takes up C0<sub>2</sub> from air and converts it to carbon compounds like carbohydrates. The plant quickly dies and starts sinking, taking the carbon with it. What happens thereafter is the key to the technique&#8217;s efficacy: If it sinks well below the ocean surface, the carbon would effectively have been put away for a long period (Carbon sequestration). This has led to several experiments in recent times."
