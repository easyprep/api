  "explanation": "India’s first vertical garden has set up at the Hosur Road Electronics City Flyover in Bengaluru, Karnataka to control the pollution level of the city. It will also act as a soundproofing barrier. The garden is an initiative of NGO “SayTrees”, who are firm to protect nature. The vertical garden is designed in such a way that a pillar of the flyover is covered with the garden flaunting lovely saplings that are organic and refreshing. The garden also has an automatic drip irrigation system allowing the plants to get 100 milliliters of water on a daily basis."
