  "answer": "This layer is ideal for flying aeroplanes",
  "explanation": "The Mesosphere is the layer of the earth's atmosphere which is an intermediate layer beyond the ozone layer. It lies upto an altitude of 80 km from the earth’s surface. The temperature gradually falls to -100°C at 80 km altitude in this layer. The meteorites burn up in this layer on entering from the space.<br />The Stratosphere is ideal for flying aeroplanes."
