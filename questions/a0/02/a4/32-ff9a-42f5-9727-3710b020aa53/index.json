  "explanation": "India seals agreement with UN to build homes for Nepal quake victims. The massive earthquake in Nepal in April, 2015 created destruction in the Himalayan nation, killing over 10,000 people and injuring nearly 22,000 people. Gorkha and Nuwakot were the worst-hit districts. In a reconstruction bid for earthquake-ravaged Nepal, India signed an agreement with United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) to build 50, 000 homes for earthquake victims. Under the project, 26,912 home owners will be benefited in Gorkha and 23,088 homeowners in Nuwakot, according to Indian Embassy sources. India will give USD 8.41 million to the UNOPS and USD 7.41 Million to the UNDP to build 50, 000 homes by this agreement.",
