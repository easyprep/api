  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe constitution provides for UCC under article 44. According to the article, the state must guarantee a uniform civil code for all the citizens. This falls under the directive principles of state policy. The DPSP is not justiciable. Recently, the SC highlighted the governmentâ€™s failure to bring in UCC.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nGoa is the only state in India with a UCC. It has a common family law called the Goa Civil Code which governs all individuals irrespective of religion, ethnicity, linguistic origins, etc. the Goa Civil Code is based on Portuguese Civil Code.\n&nbsp;"
