  "question": "&nbsp; Consider the following statements about the Madden Julian Oscillation: <ol> <li>Its effect is witnessed mainly in the tropical region in between 30 degrees North and 30 degrees south of the equator</li> <li>Whenever this phenomenon occurs, it causes dry seasons in India</li> </ol> &nbsp;Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "Madden Julian Oscillation is phenomenon which takes its name from the two scientists who identified it in 1971&mdash; Roland Madden and Paul Julian. It is characterized by a disturbance of clouds, wind and pressure, moving eastward at a speed of 4-8 metres per second. Its effect is witnessed mainly in the tropical region in between 30 degrees North and 30 degrees south of the equator. Generally the MJO cycle lasts only 30-60 days, but can also extend upto 90 days. So, there can be multiple MJO events in a season. During its active phase over Indian Ocean it brings frequent cyclonic activity, and can initiate the onset of the monsoon, thus, causing, one or two weeks of intense rainfall in India in June. But during its other phase it suppresses rainfall in India."
