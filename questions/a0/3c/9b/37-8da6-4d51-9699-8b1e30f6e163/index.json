  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because White Gold has more Zinc, whereas Yellow Gold usually contains more Nickel. White Gold has Rhodium coating, whereas Yellow Gold does not have the same. The Rhodium coating makes the White Gold costlier and more durable than Yellow Gold. White gold&nbsp;is an alloy of&nbsp;gold&nbsp;and at least one&nbsp;white metal,&nbsp;nickel, manganese or palladium."
