  "question": "The radiation released by radioactive elements is called ionizing radiation because, upon exposure, it sets free electrons from atoms into the tissues of the body. With this reference, which among the following is / are ionizing radiations generated from radioactive elements or nuclear reactions?<br> 1. Beta Particles<br> 2. Alpha Particles<br> 3. Gamma Rays<br> 4. Neutrons<br> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "The four main kinds of ionizing radiation are beta particles, alpha particles, gamma rays (and X-rays) and neutrons. The last is usually not a concern with nuclear facilities, though it is a source of prompt radiation dose in the case of nuclear explosions. Ionizing radiation effectively causes damage to the body be cause it delivers its energy in a concentrated manner, thereby breaking chemical bonds. The damage to the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) in the cell nucleus is of particular concern"
