  "option3": "Multi-Commodity Exchange of India Ltd (MCX)",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Multi-Commodity Exchange of India Ltd (MCX)",
  "explanation": "The Multi-Commodity Exchange of India Ltd (MCX) has launched Indiaâ€™s first commodity options in gold and gave stakeholders a new set of financial instruments to hedge their price risks. It is launched by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in New Delhi on October 17, 2017. MCX has currently launched a Gold Option contract, with Gold (1 Kg) futures as the underlying asset, with expiry on November 28, 2017 and January 29, 2018. The options product is unique and the first of its kind, giving buyers the right to buy or sell the underlying asset, but no obligation, at a specified price at the expiry. Thus, for buyers, the risk is limited only to the premium paid to the option seller (i.e. Option writer)."
