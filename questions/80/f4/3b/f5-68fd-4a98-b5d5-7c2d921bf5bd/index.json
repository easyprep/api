  "answer": "Germany",
  "explanation": "Germany's UNESCO World Heritage Site is \"Castles of Augustusburg and Falkenlust at Bruhl\". This site is set in an idyllic garden landscape, begun by architect Johann Conrad Schlaun, and finished by Fran√ßois de Cuvillies, Augustusburg Castle, the sumptuous residence of the prince-archbishops of Cologne, and the Falkenlust hunting lodge, a small rural folly, are among the earliest and best examples of 18-century Rococo architecture in Germany, and directly linked to the great European architecture and art of unprecedented richness of the time. In 1725, Clemens August of Bavaria (1700-1761), Prince-Elector and archbishop of Cologne, planned and constructed this large residence at Bruhl on the foundations of a medieval castle. It consists of three wings built of brick with rough-cast rendering and has two adjoining orangeries, one on the south side which includes an oratory, while the other to the north houses various service buildings."
