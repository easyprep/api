  "explanation": "Salpausselka Ridge is an extensive ridge system left by the ice age in Southern Finland. It is a large moraine formation that formed in front of the Baltic ice lake during the Younger Dryas period about 12250-10400 years ago. It traps the extensive river and lake systems of Central Finland known as Finnish Lakeland and forces the water to flow through few breaches in the ridge."
