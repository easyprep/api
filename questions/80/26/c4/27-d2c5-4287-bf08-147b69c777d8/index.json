  "question": "Which of the following is / are correct statements about “Crown Representative”, which came into existence after the Government of India Act 1935?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The Crown Representative was subordinate to the Viceroy</li>\r\n<li>The Crown Representative exercised his functions through an agency of Political Department, Local Residents and Political Agents</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "Office of Viceroy of India was called Crown Representative And Governor- General from 1937 till 1937. Under the Act of 1935, the Government of India remained purely an official government under the control of the Secretary of State, but there were two vital changes. First, the relations of the Crown with the Indian States were no longer the concern of the Government of India. They passed to the Crown Representative, a new functionary (though the same individual held the offices of both Governor-General and Crown Representative). The Crown Representative exercised his functions in relation to the Indian States through the agency of the Political department, local Residents and Political Agents. In this question, statement 1 is obviously incorrect."
