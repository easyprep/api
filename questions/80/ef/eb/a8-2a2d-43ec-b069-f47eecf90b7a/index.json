  "answer": "Kerala",
  "explanation": "The Kerala Legislative Assembly has passed a resolution demanding the Union government to lift the travel restrictions on National Highway-766 (NH-766)to safeguard the right of the people of north Kerala to move freely. The resolution pointed out that the NH 766 is a survival route for the people of Wayanad which lacks rail and connectivity and water routes. The NH-766, which links Kerala & Karnataka through the Bandipur forest, is also an important route for the transportation of vegetables, grain and construction materials between the two States. The night travel (9pm-6 am) on the forest stretch of NH-766 had been banned since 2009 in the name of protecting wildlife."
