  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nStudies show that Delhi has some of the highest levels of sound pollution in the world. About 64% of hearing loss in such cities is caused by noise pollution. The studies reported that China’s Guangzhou has the highest noise pollution levels in the world.\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nNIHL can be prevented using diet. NIHL is mainly caused by occupational exposures, unsafe recreation, and other noise exposures. NIHL can be prevented by supplementation with beta carotene, vitamins E and C, magnesium etc. the antioxidants protect hair cells in the inner ear from damage.\n&nbsp;"
