  "question": "What is the total number of allowed orbitals in a shell, if principal quantum number is n?",
  "option1": "n",
  "option2": "2n",
  "option3": "n<sup>2</sup>",
  "option4": "n<sup>3</sup>",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "n<sup>2</sup>",
  "explanation": "The principal quantum number also helps in identifying the shell. As the value of ‘n’ increases, the number of allowed orbital increases and are given by n<sup>2</sup>."
