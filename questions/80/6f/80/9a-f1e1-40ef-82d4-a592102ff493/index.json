  "question": "With reference to the structure of Earth, despite the hottest temperature at Inner Core, why the Earth has a solid inner core but liquid outer core?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Because the inner core is made of heavy metals</li>\r\n<li>Because the inner core is under huge pressure</li>\r\n<li>Because the inner core is actually getting cooled from inside</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 2",
  "option4": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "The high pressures deep inside the Earth do have other interesting effects; for example, in the crust and mantle (which make up the outer 2900 km (1800 miles) of the Earth), you see different sorts of minerals at different depths because each is only stable over a certain range of pressures. Also, while the outer core of the Earth is made of liquid iron, the inner core is solid due to the high pressures at the center of the Earth."
