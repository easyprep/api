  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Ecuador",
  "explanation": "Mama Negra is a major festival celebrated in Latacunga province of Ecuador. Ecuador's Latacunga acts as the gateway to the avenue of volcanoes and the perfect destination from mountain climbing and hiking. The Ecuadorian festival occurs annually and pays homage to the Virgin de la Merced (Virgin of Mercy). It is said that the beginnings of the celebrations stem from the eruption of nearby Cotopaxi volcano in 1742. The locals pleaded to the patron of the volcano, that is to say, the Virgin of Mercy, for their city to be spared from the devastation. The Mama Negra festivities traditionally occur on the 23-24 September, however, the event is usually celebrated on the weekend that falls closest to these dates. The festival takes place in November as well, usually to coincide with Latacunga’s Independence Day on the 11th. The festival is an eclectic celebration of music, colour and dance. It is the byproduct of a whole different range of cultural traditions including Spanish, Mayan, Inca and African."
