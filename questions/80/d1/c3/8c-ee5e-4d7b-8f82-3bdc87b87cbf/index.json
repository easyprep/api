  "question": "The Equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation has affected the 2019 summer monsoon rainfall favourably. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>A strong EQUINOO favours Indian monsoon rainfall.</li>\n<li>EQUINOO increases clouding in the Eastern Equatorial Indian Ocean region.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nEQUINOO is a seesaw/ oscillation in convection between the western and eastern regions of the Indian Ocean. A strong EQUINOO favours good rainfall during the summer monsoon. The EQUINOO strengthened during the latter part of the monsoon period in 2019.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nEQUINOO increases the clouding in the western part of Equatorial Indian Ocean. During EQUINOO, the surface temperature in the western part of Indian Ocean increases above 27.5 degree Celsius. This induces cloud formation in this region and decreases the same in the eastern part."
