  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Finland",
  "explanation": "Salpa Line, also known as the Suomen Salpa, is defensive-bunker line on the eastern border of Finland. This line was built during the Interim Peace period between the Winter War and the Continuation War to defend Finland against a possible Soviet invasion. This 1200km long line stretches from the Gulf of Finland to northern Finland. This line never saw a military action because the Soviet Offensive in 1944 was stopped at the VKT-Line on the Karelian Isthmus."
