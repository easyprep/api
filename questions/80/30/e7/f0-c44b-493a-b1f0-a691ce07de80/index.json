  "question": "Rare Kakapo parrots, sometimes seen in news, are found in which of the following countries?",
  "option1": "Vietnam",
  "option2": "India",
  "option3": "New Zealand",
  "option4": "Australia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "New Zealand",
  "explanation": "The critically endangered ‘Kakapos’ - the world\\'s fattest species of parrot - have enjoyed a record breaking breeding season, according to New Zealand\\'s Department of Conservation (DOC). This year, 76 chicks have been hatched under the DOC\\'s conservation scheme, with 60 expected to reach adulthood. This will significantly boost the population which has grown to 147 adults since a small number of the plump green, yellow and black birds were discovered in 1970.  The kakapo is an \\\"unusual\\\" parrot as the females control the breeding process and only mate every two to four years when their favourite fruit grows in New Zealand\\'s Rimu trees - the period is known as a \\\"mast year\\\". New Zealand\\'s kakapo recovery programme is so tightly monitored that although they remain in the wild, each one has a radio transmitter attached to its body and there are monitoring systems embedded in their nests. It is claimed that kakapo is probably one of the most intensively managed species in the world."
