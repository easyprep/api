  "explanation": "Market capitalization (or market cap) is the total value of the issued shares of a publicly traded company; it is equal to the share price times the number of shares outstanding. As outstanding stock is bought and sold in public markets, capitalization could be used as a proxy for the public opinion of a company&#8217;s net worth and is a determining factor in some forms of stock valuation. It’s a measure of investor&#8217;s health."
