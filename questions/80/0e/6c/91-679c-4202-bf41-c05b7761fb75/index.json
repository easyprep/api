  "question": "Consider the following statements about Gravitational waves: <ol> <li>Gravitational waves (GWs) cannot be seen with naked eyes or even with the help of&nbsp; telescope</li> <li>The discovery of Gravitational waves will help to understand more about black holes and death of stars</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Gravitational waves are not similar to electromagnetic waves and hence cannot be detected through naked eyes or with telescope. The discovery of gravitational waves is likely to enhance our knowledge on black holes, certain neutron stars and other cosmic neighbourhood."
