  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Sweden",
  "explanation": "India and Sweden are to sign their first maritime cooperation agreement during the Swedish Royal couple visit. The agreement includes cooperation between the countries in both Arctic and Antarctic regions and hence the name Polar Science. In the last few years, India has signed series of maritime agreements to exchange military information and to extend the reach of its armed forces in the arctic region. This will help India to learn about resource exploration and keep in pace.<br />The agreement further aids in Indiaâ€™s ambitions in strengthening its defence forces. The agreement will help India get access to Russian bases in the Arctic."
