  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "Ring wells come into prevalence for the first time in Gupta period, so first statement is not correct. Metronymics means a name derived from the name of a mother or female ancestor. The Satavahana rulers had the names of their mothers with their names such as Gautamiputra Satkarni,he adopted ‘Gautami’ on the name of her mother ‘Gautami . Thus second statement is also not correct. Third statement is correct."
