  "explanation": "Geeta Johri, a 1982-batch IPS officer, has been appointed  Director General of Police (DGP) of Gujarat. With this, Johari has become the first woman IPS officer to be appointed for the top job in the state. Presently, she is posted as managing director in the Gujarat Police Housing Corporation, Gandhinagar.  She has been controversial for her role in the investigation into the 2005 Sohrabuddin Sheikh, his wife Kauserbi and 2006 Tulsiram Prajapati encounter cases. The decision comes in wake of sudden ouster of Johariâ€™s predecessor P P Pandey who stepped down from the post following a petition in the Supreme Court. Pandey is an accused in Ishrat Jahan encounter case."
