  "question": "With reference to the press coverage surrounding the electricity infrastructure and the costs incurred by it in India, consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>Free electricity supply has a role in over-exploitation of ground water.</li>\n<li>India is a net importer of electricity.</li>\n<li>Energy Efficiency Label for Residential Sector was developed by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "2 only",
  "option2": "1 and 3",
  "option3": "All of the above",
  "option4": "2 and 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong> Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nMany experts blame the policy of providing free electricity to farmers as one of the major reasons for the inefficient electricity sector in the country. In Punjab, for example, 14.5 lakh agricultural tubewells receive free power. This is not confined to small farmers, but also large farmers. The bill on the state exchequer has crossed 6500 crore INR annually. Also the free power is leading to use of pumps with higher HPs. Hence it has led to overdependence on the ground water and has deterred the diversification to rainwater harvesting and other sustainable water sources.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nIn 2017, India became a net exporter of electricity. Electricity export is monitored by the Central Electricity Authority. In 2016-17, the country exported 5798 million units to Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar. Historically, India had been a net importer of electricity. Major exporter of electricity to India is Bhutan. The export of Indian electricity increased after the establishment of the 1<sup>st</sup> cross- boundary connection between India and Bangladesh in 2013.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe star labelling system for energy efficient homes was launched in March of 2019. The Energy Efficiency Labelling for Residential Homes was developed by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE). This measure will improve the availability of information to consumers about the homes’ energy efficiency. In future, this is expected to have an impact on home pricing. BEE is a government agency under the ministry of power."
