  "option1": "Mexico",
  "option2": "Spain",
  "option3": "Chile",
  "option4": "Hungary",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Hungary",
  "explanation": "Arpad was the head of the confederation of the Magyar tribes at the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries. He might have been either the sacred ruler of the Hungarians or their military leader. Despite this, many Hungarians refer to him as the \"founder of our country\", and Arpad's preeminent role in the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin has been emphasized by some later chronicles. The dynasty descending from Arpad ruled the Kingdom of Hungary until 1301.",
