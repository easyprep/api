  "question": "Olga Tokarczuk, who has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for 2018, is from which country?",
  "option1": "Poland",
  "option2": "Austria",
  "option3": "France",
  "option4": "Britain",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Poland",
  "explanation": "Polish author Olga Tokarczuk  has won the 2018 Nobel Prize in literature for a narrative imagination that with encyclopedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life. Her first novel, \\\"The Journey of the People of the Book,\\\" was released in 1993. She has also won the Booker International Prize for her 2007 novel \\\"Flights\\\".  She became the 15th woman to have won the prestigious distinction, out of 116 literature laureates honoured since 1901. It must be noted that the 2019 Nobel Prize in Literature was announced along with the 2018 Prize as the latter was delayed by a year following a scandal that included allegations of sexual misconduct."
