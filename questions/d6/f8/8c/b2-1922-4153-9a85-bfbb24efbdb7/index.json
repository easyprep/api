A revolution which placed on its agenda the building of a society in which exploitation of man by man would be ended. Progressive humanity the world over hailed it. It gave a new impetus to national liberation movements, including our own. Gandhi, Tilak, Nehru, Subhash Bose and the great poets Rabindranath Tagore and Iqbal among many others welcomed it. The Russian Revolution and the Indian freedom struggle became great friends. The rise of the broad left and of the Communist movement-in our own freedom struggle can be traced to the inspiring message of this world-shaking event. However it needs to be stressed that the communist movement and the broad left could take advantage of the ideas of the Socialist Revolution because of the favourable conditions obtaining in our own freedom struggle.
