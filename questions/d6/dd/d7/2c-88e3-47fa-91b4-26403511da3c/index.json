  "question": "&nbsp;Consider the following Landforms: <ol> <li>Ox-Bow Lake</li> <li>Cirque</li> <li>Ventifacts</li> </ol> &nbsp; Which of the above is/are examples of lacustrine deposits?",
  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "1 Only",
  "option3": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "An&nbsp;oxbow lake&nbsp;is a U-shaped body of water that forms when a wide&nbsp;meander&nbsp;from the&nbsp;main stem&nbsp;of a&nbsp;river&nbsp;is&nbsp;cut off, creating a free-standing body of water. Cirque is a valley formed by the glacial action. Ventifacts&nbsp;are&nbsp;rocks&nbsp;that have been abraded, pitted, etched, grooved, or polished by wind-driven sand or ice crystals; it is thus an example of Aeolian deposits.&nbsp;Lacustrine deposits&nbsp;are sedimentary rock formations which formed in the bottom of ancient lakes.&nbsp;Lacustrine deposits form in all lake types including rift&nbsp;graben&nbsp;lakes,&nbsp;oxbow lakes, glacial lakes, and&nbsp;crater lakes."
