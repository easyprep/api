  "explanation": "In Cricket, Pawan Shah has created history by registering the 2nd highest individual score in Under-19 internationals against hosts Sri Lanka in the first innings on the 2nd day of the final \\'Youth Test\\' in Hambantota on July 25, 2018. The Indian innings was declared when the 18-year-old Pawan Shah from Pune was dismissed at 282. His score came off 332 balls with 33 boundaries and a six in just under 7 hours. With this score, Shah became the 2nd Indian to score a double-century after Tanmay Srivastava, who had scored 220 against Pakistan in Peshawar in September 2006. Though, he failed to beat Australian Clinton Peake\\'s 304 not out against India in Melbourne in 1995, which is still the highest score at this Under-19 level."
