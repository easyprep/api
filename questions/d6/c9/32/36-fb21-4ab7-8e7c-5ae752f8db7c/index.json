  "question": "Consider the following statements:<br />1. Baking soda is used in fire extinguishers.<br />2. Quicklime is used in the manufacture of glass.<br />3. Gypsum is used in the manufacture of Plaster of Paris.<br />Which of the statements given above is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 and 2",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 only",
  "option4": "1, 2 and 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 and 3",
  "explanation": "Baking soda is a great as a fire extinguisher for electrical fires and grease fires. When baking soda is heated it releases carbon dioxide and produces water <br />2NaHCO3  -  H2O + CO2 + Na2CO3 <br />Since carbon dioxide is heavier than air and does not support combustion like oxygen does, it smothers the fire while water that is formed cools the fire to below ignition temperature. Calcium oxide, chemical compound, CaO is also called lime, quicklime, or caustic lime. Calcium oxide is widely used in making porcelain and glass. Plaster of Paris is a type of building material based on calcium sulphate hemihydrate nominally CaSO4.1/ 2H2O. <br />It is created by heating gypsum to about 300°F (150ºC). <br />2CaSO4.2H2O -  2CaSO4.1/ 2H2O + 3H2O\r\n&nbsp;"
