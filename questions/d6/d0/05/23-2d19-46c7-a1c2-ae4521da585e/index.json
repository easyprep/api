Phrenology is primarily focused on measurements of the human skull, based on the concept that the brain is the organ of the mind, and that certain brain areas have localized, specific functions or modules. Bionomics is the branch of biology concerned with the relations between organisms and their environment. Bionics is the application of biological methods and systems found in nature to the study and design of engineering systems and modern technology."
