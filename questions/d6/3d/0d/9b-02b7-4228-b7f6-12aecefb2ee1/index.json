  "explanation": "On the basis of administration, the forests in India are of three categories: <br /><strong>1.Reserved Forests<br /></strong>These forests are under the direct supervision of the government and no public entry is allowed for collection of timber or grazing of cattle. About 53 per cent of the total forest area falls in this category.<br /><strong>2.Protected Forests<br /></strong>These forests are looked after by the government, but the local people are allowed to collect fuel-wood/timber and graze their cattle without causing serious damage to the forests. These forests occupy about 29 per cent of the total forest area of the country. <br /><strong>3.Unclassified Forests<br /></strong>The unclassified forests are those in which there is no restriction on the cutting of trees and grazing of cattle. About 18 per cent of the total forest area of the country falls under this category."
