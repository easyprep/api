  "question": "The researchers at which IIT have developed method to make biofuel with sugar and salt?",
  "option1": "IIT Indore",
  "option2": "IIT Bombay",
  "option3": "IIT Hyderabad",
  "option4": "IIT Kanpur",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "IIT Hyderabad",
  "explanation": "By using sugar, sulphuric acid and salt, the researchers of IIT Hyderabad have developed a cheap and efficient nano-carbon catalyst to help in the production of biofuel precursors. The catalyst showed better efficiency and selectivity than the commercially available variants to produce the desired C15 oxygenated hydrocarbon â€” a precursor to diesel and jet fuel. This development is important as States like Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh /Telengana  produce a large amount of corncob waste in the country. This can be converted into valuable fuel instead of being burnt. The nano-carbon catalyst developed by the institute can enable conversion into biofuel (fuel from biological sources rather than fossil fuels) and provide an additional earning opportunity for the corn farmer, besides being a sustainable energy source."
