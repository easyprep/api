  "question": "Which neighboring country of India has banned all Indian currency notes above Rs 100?",
  "option1": "Nepal",
  "option2": "Bhutan",
  "option3": "Bangladesh",
  "option4": "Sri Lanka",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Nepal",
  "explanation": "The Nepal government has banned the use of Indian currency notes of Rs 2,000, Rs 500 and Rs 200 denominations  in the country. The decision will adversely affect Nepalese labourers working in India as well as Indian tourists visiting the Himalayan nation. Currently, India is Nepalâ€™s largest trade partner and supplies the majority of its consumer goods. Indian currency is extensively used by Nepalese people and businesses for their savings and transactions. Hence, the Nepalese government has asked the people to refrain from keeping or carrying Indian bank notes higher than Rs. 100 denomination as it has not legalised them."
