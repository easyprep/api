  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Kolkata",
  "explanation": "Kolkata has become the first Indian metro to get a floating market. The market will be located on a water-body with boats doubling up as shops. It was inaugurated by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on January 24, 2018. The purpose of this floating market is to rehabilitate over 200 shopkeepers from a nearby market that was demolished for the widening of the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass â€” an important road that connects the northern parts of the city to the eastern and southern tips. According to government officials, the market will host at least 114 boats, each one accommodating two shops. Shops will sell regular or daily-use items that include vegetables, fruits, flowers, fish and meat and poultry. Shoppers will approach the boats through wooden walkways."
