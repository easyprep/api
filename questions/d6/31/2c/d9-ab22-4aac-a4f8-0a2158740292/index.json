  "question": "“The pressure exerted on an enclosed liquid at one place is transmitted equally throughout the liquid”. Which of the following principle is related to above given definition?",
  "option1": "Pascal's principle",
  "option2": "Bernoulli's principle",
  "option3": "Huygens' principle",
  "option4": "Archimedes' Principle",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Pascal's principle",
  "explanation": "<strong>Pascal’s principle</strong>– The pressure exerted on an enclosed liquid at one place is transmitted equally throughout the liquid.<br /><strong>Bernoulli\\'s principle</strong>– In an irrotational fluid, the sum of the static pressure, the weight of the fluid per unit mass times the height and half the density times the velocity squared is constant throughout the fluid.<br /><strong>Huygens\\' principle</strong>– The mechanical propagation of a wave (specifically, of light) is equivalent to assuming that every point on the wavefront acts as point source of wave emission.<br /><strong>Archimedes\\' Principle</strong>-This principle states that when a body is wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, it experiences an upthrust equal to the weight of the fluid displaced."
