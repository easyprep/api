  "question": "The researchers at which University have developed a low-cost filter to remove arsenic from water?",
  "option1": "Delhi University",
  "option2": "IIT Bombay",
  "option3": "Tezpur University",
  "option4": "IISC Bangalore",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Tezpur University",
  "explanation": "Researchers at Assam\\'s Tezpur University have developed a simple and cost-effective filtration system - Arsiron Nilogon - that may help reduce the health burden caused by arsenic and iron contaminated groundwater. The system filters out 99.9% of the arsenic contamination from the groundwater to make it suitable for drinking. The chemicals used in the filtration process are cooking soda for pH conditioning, potassium permanganate for supplying oxygen and ferric chloride for providing solid iron oxide adsorbents of arsenic. The method can remove arsenic even to below 2 ppb (parts per billion) level while the World Health Organization (WHO) has set 10 ppb as the standard level. According to theWHO, arsenic is a natural component of the Earth\\'s crust and is widely distributed throughout the environment -- in air, water and land.  However, it is highly toxic in its inorganic form. The long term exposure to inorganic arsenic, mainly by drinking contaminated water, eating food grown or even prepared with this water, can cause skin lesions and cancer. The filtration process also removes other toxic metal ions like manganese, lead, nickel, chromium, copper, etc, very well along with arsenic and iron."
