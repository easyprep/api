  "option2": "Karnataka & Andhra Pradesh",
  "option3": "Maharashtra & Karnataka",
  "option4": "Karnataka & Gujarat",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Maharashtra & Karnataka",
  "explanation": "Karnataka and Maharashtra have jointly got the Geographical Indication (GI) tag for Namma Kolhapuri chappal. These leather chappals are hand-crafted and tanned using vegetable dyes. The art of making them is passed down one generation to another. The traditional chappal making will get a modern touch. LIDKAR has in-house fashion designers who will design the footwear. According to LIDKAR officials, there are 5,000 people from villages in Belagavi, Bagalkote and even Dharwad making Kolhapuri chappals at their houses. Their market is restricted to nearest towns. The GI tag approvals implies that the artisans producing Kolhapuris in these districts will now be able to make and market their product in domestic and international markets. This also means the artisans can tie up with leading e-commerce players for higher profits. More importantly, it also prohibit the usage of the term \\\"Kolhapuris\\\" for similar products made in other parts of the country."
