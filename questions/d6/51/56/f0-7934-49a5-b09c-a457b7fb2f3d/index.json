  "question": "Chlorophyll:<br> 1. is found only in higher plants<br> 2. absorbs green light of the spectrum to produce energy<br> 3. a magnesium containing protein<br> Which among the above is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "Chlorophyll absorbs light most strongly in the blue portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, followed by the red portion. Conversely, it is a poor absorber of green and near-green portions of the spectrum, hence the green color of chlorophyll-containing tissues. At the center of the chlorin ring is a magnesium ion. At the time of its discovery in the early 1900s, this was the first time that this element had been detected in living tissue."
