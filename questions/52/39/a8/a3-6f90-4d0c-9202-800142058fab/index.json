  "question": "A piece of Ice was tied with a string to a water bucketâ€™s bottom, and the water bucket was filled with water with ice fully submerged in it. What would be the impact on the level of water when the ice melts away completely?",
  "option1": "The level of water will go up",
  "option2": "The level of water will go down",
  "option3": "The level of water will remain unchanged",
  "option4": "The level of water will first increase then come to the previous on",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "The level of water will go down",
  "explanation": "There are two dimensions of this experiment. One is when Ice floats in water and another is as mentioned in the question. When Ice floats in water, the level of water will remain unchanged when the ice melts away because in this situation, Ice replaced water which is `equal to its weight`. But when the floating ice is taken down in the bottom of the bucket and tied over there with a string, and let melt away, the level of water will come down because now the ice was replacing the water `equal to its volume `and Ice has a lower density of water. So The answer of this question is -The level of water will go down."
