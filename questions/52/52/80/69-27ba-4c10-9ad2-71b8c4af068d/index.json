  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nAtolls are formed out of coral reefs that develop atop a seamount. Seamounts are mountains that arise from the ocean floor but do not break out of the water surface. Most of the atolls occur in the Pacific Ocean region.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nMaldives is an atoll nation. The atoll nations form a part of 57 small island nations that have been categorised to be at high risk due to climate change. Atoll nations tend to have low elevation, thin land mass and lack of higher ground that they could use in times of disaster. Â \n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nThe Asian Development Bank had conducted the conference on Resilient Atoll Nations in Productive Oceans in line with the works under the Coalition of Low-lying Atoll Nations on Climate Change. This coalition consists of Maldives, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Kiribati. The first event under this coalition had taken place in Fiji in April this year.\n&nbsp;"
