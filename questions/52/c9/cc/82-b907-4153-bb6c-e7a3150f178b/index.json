This monument provides an appropriate tribute to Christopher Columbus which features projecting beams of light, forming a cross shape which is so powerful that they can be seen from neighbouring Puerto Rico. Dominican authorities claim that they preserve remains of Christopher Columbus at the lighthouse."
