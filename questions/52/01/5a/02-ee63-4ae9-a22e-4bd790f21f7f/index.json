The HS code is a 6-digit identification code developed by the World Customs Organization (WCO) and is used by customs officers to allow products to cross international borders. It is an international nomenclature for the classification of products. It allows participating countries to classify traded goods on a common basis for customs purposes. The code follows from the Kyoto Convention of 1974 and is used by over 200 countries."
