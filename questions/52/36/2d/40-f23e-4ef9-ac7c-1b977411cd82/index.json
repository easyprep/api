  "question": "A certain sum, invested at 4% per annum compound interest, compounded half yearly, amounts to 7803 Rs. at the end of one year. The sum is :",
  "option1": "7200 Rs.",
  "option2": "7500 Rs.",
  "option3": "7700 Rs.",
  "option4": "7000 Rs.",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "7500 Rs.",
  "explanation": "Let the sum be P. \r\nAs, the interest is compounded half-yearly, \r\nâˆ´ R = 2%, T = 2 half years\r\n$latex \\\\therefore A = P \\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{R}{100} \\\\right )^{T}&s=1$\r\n$latex => 7803 = P \\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{2}{100} \\\\right )^{2}&s=1$\r\n$latex => 7803 = P \\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{1}{50} \\\\right )^{2}&s=1$\r\n$latex => 7803 = P\\\\times \\\\frac{51}{50}\\\\times \\\\frac{51}{50}&s=1$\r\n$latex => P = \\\\frac{7803\\\\times 50\\\\times 50}{51\\\\times 51} = 7500Rs&s=1$\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer."
