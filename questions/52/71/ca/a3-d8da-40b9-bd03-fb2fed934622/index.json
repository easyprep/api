  "question": "Consider the following natural phenomena: <br />1. Terrestrial heating<br />2. Reflection of light<br />3. Refraction of light<br />4. Diffraction of light<br />Due to which of these phenomena is mirage formed?",
  "option1": "1 and 2",
  "option2": "2, 3 and 4",
  "option3": "1 and 3",
  "option4": "4 only",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 3",
  "explanation": "Convection currents of hot air rising off a surface have a lower density than the air directly above it. The difference in density cause light passing through the air to refract differently, which causes the formation of mirage."
