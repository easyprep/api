  "answer": "WHO",
  "explanation": "Objective behind publishing this list is to address the problem of people's inability to access diagnostic services. WHO outlined that an estimated 46 percent of adults with Type 2 diabetes worldwide were undiagnosed, thereby facing serious health risks and complications. WHO's essential diagnostics list concentrates on in-vitro tests like tests of blood and urine. tests have been enlisted for detection and diagnosis of a wide range of common conditions while 55 tests are designed for the detection, diagnosis and monitoring of 'priority' diseases such as HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, human papillomavirus and syphilis.",
