  "question": "<p>The nucleus of an atom consists of which of the following?</p>",
  "option1": "Electrons and Neutrons",
  "option2": "Electrons and Protons",
  "option3": "Protons and Neutrons",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Protons and Neutrons",
  "explanation": "<p>The atom is the smallest unit of matter that is composed of three sub-atomic particles: the proton, the neutron, and the electron. Protons and neutrons make up the nucleus of the atom, a dense and positively charged core, whereas the negatively charged electrons can be found around the nucleus in an electron cloud. An atom consists of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by one or more negatively charged particles called electrons. The number of protons found in the nucleus equals the number of electrons that surround it, giving the atom a neutral charge (neutrons have zero charges). Most of an atomâ€™s mass is in its nucleus; the mass of an electron is only 1/1836 the mass of the lightest nucleus, that of hydrogen. Although the nucleus is heavy, it is small compared with the overall size of an atom.</p>"
