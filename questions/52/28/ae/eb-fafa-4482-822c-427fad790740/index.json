  "question": "In the eye donation, which part of the eye is transplanted from the donor?",
  "option1": "Cornea",
  "option2": "Lens",
  "option3": "Retina",
  "option4": "The whole eye",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Cornea",
  "explanation": "There is currently no way to transplant an entire eye. Ophthalmologists can, however, transplant a cornea. When someone says they are getting an “eye transplant,” they are most likely receiving a donor cornea, which is the clear front part of the eye that helps focus light so that you can see."
