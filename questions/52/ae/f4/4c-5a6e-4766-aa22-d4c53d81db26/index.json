  "question": "Consider the following statements about the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution: <ol> <li>The Ninth Schedule was added to Constitution by the First constitutional amendment act</li> <li>Laws inserted in the Ninth Schedule enjoy absolute immunity from judicial review</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "Second statement is incorrect because laws inserted in the ninth schedule though enjoy higher immunity to judicial review than other laws, but there is no provision for absolute immunity to laws. In 2007, a nine-judge Bench of the Supreme Court in a historic judgement said that since there is no specific criterion for \"Insertion of a law in the Ninth Schedule, the laws cannot enjoy absolute immunity and hence are subjected to judicial review."
