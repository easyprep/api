  "question": "Over the issue of false complaints about mosques in Delhi, the Ethics Committee of the Lok Sabha has come into discussion. Consider the following statements about the committee:\n<ol>\n<li>Such a committee exists only for the Lower House of the Parliament.</li>\n<li>The members of the committee are nominated by the Speaker.</li>\n<li>The Lok Sabha committee on ethics has a ‘registry of interest’ of the MPs.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 and 3",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "2 only",
  "option4": "1 only",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 only",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nSeparate committees for ethics exist for both the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha. The functions of these committees are to oversee the ethical conduct of the House members, address complaints about unethical behaviour by the MPs, frame rules for ethical conduct by the MPs and also submit a report on investigation into complaints to the House/ chairperson depending on the nature of complaint. The committees can also take up suo motu investigations into the unethical conduct.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe members of the committee are nominated by the Speaker in case of the Lok Sabha. Its strength must not exceed 15. In case of the Upper House’s committee, the nomination is by the Chairperson i.e., the Vice President. Its strength stands at 10. The committees will have a chairperson. Initially both the committees were only ad hoc. But the Rajya Sabha in 1997 and the Lok Sabha in 2015, gave these committees permanent status.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\n“Registry of Interest” is an archive of the personal financial interests of the MPs to the House for transparency sake. Many countries around the world maintain such registers and are even backed by independent commissioners for investigations. In India, only the Upper House maintains such a register. From 2005 onwards the RS members have been required to declare their pecuniary interest in a prescribed format. In Lok Sabha’s case, such an instrument is yet to be implemented and still under consideration."
