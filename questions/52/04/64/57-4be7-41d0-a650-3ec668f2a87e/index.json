  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe red label was proposed as a part of the Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Regulations, 2018 draft. The label was to be used on the front of the packaging in case of high fat, sugar and salt content in the food. The FSSAI is also contemplating use of color coding for other less healthy food materials.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nIn a first, the draft regulation by FSSAI also recommended labelling of food items containing genetically modified ingredient. It set the threshold at 5% for labelling. India is yet to start cultivating genetically modified food crops. However, genetically modified cotton is already under cultivation."
