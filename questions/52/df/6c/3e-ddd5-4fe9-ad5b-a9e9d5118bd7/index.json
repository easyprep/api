  "question": "Which country's memorial is \"Walhalla Memorial\" that honours laudable and distinguished people of its history?",
  "option1": "Poland",
  "option2": "Denmark",
  "option3": "Austria",
  "option4": "Germany",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Germany",
  "explanation": "Walhalla Memorial is a memorial that honours laudable and distinguished people of Germany's history. The Walhalla is a hall of fame that honours laudable and distinguished people in German history – \"politicians, sovereigns, scientists and artists of the German tongue\"; thus the celebrities honoured are drawn from Greater Germany, a wider area than today's Germany, and even as far away as Britain in the case of several Anglo-Saxons who are honoured. The hall is a neo-classical building above the Danube River, in Bavaria. It was conceived in 1807 by Crown Prince Ludwig in order to support the gathering momentum for the unification of the many German states. Following his accession to the throne of Bavaria, construction took place between 1830 and 1842 under the supervision of the architect Leo von Klenze. The memorial displays some 65 plaques and 130 busts covering 2,000 years of history, beginning with Arminius, victor at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in AD 9."
