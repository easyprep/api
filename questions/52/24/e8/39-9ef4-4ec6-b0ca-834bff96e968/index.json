  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nDollar diplomacy is the use of a country’s economic powers to further its aims in another country. The powerful country uses loan guarantees to influence a receiver country to alter its foreign policy in its favour. Taiwan accused China of engaging in dollar diplomacy to get countries to cut ties with Taiwan. Eg: 8.5 million USD to Solomon Islands.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nIndia does not have formal ties with Taiwan. Currently, Taiwan has formal relations with only 16 countries. Since 2016, it has been losing ties with several countries like Burkina Faso, Dominican Republic, Sao Tome, Principe, Panama and El Salvador. China considers Taiwan to be its renegade state."
