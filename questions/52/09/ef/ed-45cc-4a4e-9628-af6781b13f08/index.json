  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nQueen Prabhavatigupta was born into the Gupta Dynasty to King Chandragupta II. However, she was married to the Vakataka Dynasty’s King Rudrasena II and ruled the Vakatakas for about a decade after his death. She was one of the most powerful woman rulers of the dynasty. New information about her rule were recently uncovered through the Nagpur excavations.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Vakatakas are known for their affiliation to Shaivism while the Guptas were followers of Vaishnava sect of Hinduism. When Rudrasena II died, Queen Prabhavatigupta propagated Vaishava practices through her role as the ruler- especially in Maharahstra’s Vidarbha region. Some of the religious structures with Vaishnava affiliation dating back to her period are Varaha temple, Rudra Narasimha temple, Keval Narasimha temple etc."
