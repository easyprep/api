  "question": "Which boxing defense technique in which a boxer keeps his/her hands held high to protect the head and chin and the forearms are tucked against the torso to impede body shots?",
  "option1": "Slipping",
  "option2": "Bobbing",
  "option3": "Blocking",
  "option4": "Cover-Up",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Cover-Up",
  "explanation": "Covering up is the last opportunity (other than rolling with a punch) to avoid an incoming strike to an unprotected face or body. Generally speaking, the hands are held high to protect the head and chin and the forearms are tucked against the torso to impede body shots. When protecting the body, the boxer rotates the hips and lets incoming punches \"roll\" off the guard. To protect the head, the boxer presses both fists against the front of the face with the forearms parallel and facing outwards. This type of guard is weak against attacks from below."
