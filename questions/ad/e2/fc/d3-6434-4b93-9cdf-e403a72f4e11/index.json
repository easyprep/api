These guidelines will be implemented in 21 Public Sector Banks (PSBs) and 19 private banks. All women SHGs will be eligible for interest subvention on credit upto Rs 3 lakh at 7% per annum.

The subvention will be available to banks on the condition that they make SHG credit available at 7% per annum.
