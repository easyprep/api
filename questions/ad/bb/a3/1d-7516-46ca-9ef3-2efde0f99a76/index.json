  "question": "With reference to the three stage Nuclear Power programme, consider the following types of reactors:<br> 1. Pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR)<br> 2. Fast breeder reactor (FBR)<br> 3. Advanced Heavy Water Reactor(AHWR)<br> Which among the following is the correct order of stages represented by above?",
  "option1": "Stage I, Stage II, Stage III",
  "option2": "Stage II, Stage I, Stage III",
  "option3": "Stage III, Stage II, Stage I",
  "option4": "Stage II, Stage III, Stage I",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Stage I, Stage II, Stage III",
  "explanation": "<p>India's three-stage nuclear power programme was formulated by Homi Bhabha in the 1950s</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Stage 1: Use natural uranium to fuel pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs). The byproduct, Pu-239, of these reactors are key for Stage 2.</li>\r\n<li>Stage 2: Develop fast breeder reactors (FBRs) to produce excess Pu-239 which will then be convert Th-232 to fissile U-233.</li>\r\n<li>Stage 3: Build thorium-based reactors that can be refuelled using India's thorium reserves, which are converted to U-233 inside the reactor.</li>\r\n</ol>"
