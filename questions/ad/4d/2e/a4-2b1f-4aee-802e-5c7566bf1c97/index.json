  "explanation": "The seven sister states are Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura. Memong narang is a wild orange endemic to Meghalaya and Khasi mandarin is yet another variety of orange found in Meghalaya. These are two GI products. Meghalaya is known for unscientific rat-hole coal mining. In 2014, the Supreme Court banned the rat hole mining in the state. However, the state government has assured for the resumption of the same practice in accordance with the environmental rules. Living root bridges are a form of tree shaping common in the southern part of the Northeast Indian state of Meghalaya."
