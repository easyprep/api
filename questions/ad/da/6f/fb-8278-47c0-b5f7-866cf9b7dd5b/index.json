  "question": "What of the following represents viscosity?",
  "option1": "resistance to fluid motion",
  "option2": "pressure difference between two fluids",
  "option3": "potential energy stored in a fluid",
  "option4": "roughness of the surface",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "resistance to fluid motion",
  "explanation": "Most of the fluids offer some resistance to motion. This resistance to fluid motion is called viscosity. This resistance is like an internal friction analogous to friction when a solid moves on a surface."
