What are the features of the stem cells? <ol> <li>They develop into organs needed for transplant</li> <li>They are found in reproductive tissue</li> <li>They develop into nerve cells and can be used by stroke victims</li> </ol> Choose the correct options:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "1 & 2",
  "option3": "1 & 3",
  "option4": "None",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None",
