  "answer": "Lord Wellesley",
  "explanation": "After the Treaty of Amiens (1802) between Napoleon and England, England had restored Pondicherry to the French. With this, Napoleon sent military officials to negotiate with Mughal emperor Shah Alam II and also seriously meditated sending forces to save Emperor from his enemies. But then, Wellesley could gauge the French design and then took Emperor under Company's protection and gave him a liberal pension. This policy safeguarded India against possible French designs."
