  "explanation": "Muizz Street, also known as Al-Muizz li-Din Allah al-Fatimi Street, is a historic and oldest street of Egypt. It forms part of the \"Historic Cairo\", which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This street represents a dense repository of historic Islamic architecture in Cairo, Egypt. Historically, it was the most important artery of the city and was often referred to as the Qasaba. It constituted the main axis of the city's economic zones where its markets were concentrated. A United Nations study discovered that the street hosts the greatest collection of medieval architectural treasures in the Islamic world. The street is named after Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah, the fourth caliph of the Fatimid Dynasty. In 1997, the national government carried out extensive renovations to the historical buildings, modern buildings, and sewerage to turn the street into an \"open-air museum\"."
