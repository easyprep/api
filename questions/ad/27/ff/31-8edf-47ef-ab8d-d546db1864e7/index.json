  "answer": "Japan",
  "explanation": "Recently, Japan has exempted import inspection for the Indian black tiger shrimps. Japan is the second largest market for Indian black tiger shrimps after the US.\r\nThis decision has been taken by the country after the export consignments were found totally free from any residue of synthetic anti-bacterial drug ‘Furazolidone’. This will enhance the farming and export of the shrimps from West Bengal and Kerala."
