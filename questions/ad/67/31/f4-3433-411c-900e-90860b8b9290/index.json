  "answer": "Rivers wash away salts from the earth and pour them into sea",
  "explanation": "After years and years of river inflow and evaporation rivers wash away salts from the earth and pour them into sea. The salt content of the river water built up to the present levels. The same process made the seas salty. Rivers carry dissolved salts to the ocean. Water evaporates from the oceans to fall again as rain and to feed the rivers, but the salts remain in the ocean."
