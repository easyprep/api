  "question": "&nbsp; &nbsp; Consider the following: <ol> <li>Contour bunding</li> <li>Monocropping&nbsp;</li> <li>Crop rotation</li> </ol> &nbsp; Which of the above help in soil conservation?",
  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option3": "1 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 & 3 Only",
  "explanation": "Crop rotation reduces soil erosion by wind and water and increases&nbsp;soil&nbsp;fertility.Contour bunding&nbsp;is the farming practice of plowing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation&nbsp;contour&nbsp;lines. Monocropping is the agricultural practice of growing a single crop year after year on the same land. Monocropping is responsible for soil erosion."
