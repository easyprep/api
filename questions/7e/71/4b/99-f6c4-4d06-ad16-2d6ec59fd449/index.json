  "question": "What is the relationship between mass and time period of a spring pendulum?",
  "option1": "T<span class=\"symbol\">&prop; </span> 1/√m",
  "option2": "T <span class=\"symbol\">&prop; </span> √m",
  "option3": "T <span class=\"symbol\">&prop; </span> m",
  "option4": "√T <span class=\"symbol\">&prop; </span> m",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "T <span class=\"symbol\">&prop; </span> √m",
  "explanation": "Time period of a spring pendulum depends on the mass suspended as T<span class=\\\"symbol\\\">&prop; </span> √m i.e. greater the mass greater will be the inertia and so lesser will be the frequency of oscillation and greater will be the time period."
