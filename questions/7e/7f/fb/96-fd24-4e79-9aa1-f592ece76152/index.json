  "question": "Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 provides punishment for the illegal hunting and trade of the wildlife. A tiger which has turned into a man eater can be hunted only if approval comes from ___?",
  "option1": "Authorities of the concerned national park / sanctuary",
  "option2": "Chief Minister of the state",
  "option3": "Environment Ministry, Government of India",
  "option4": "Chief wildlife warden of concerned state",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Chief wildlife warden of concerned state",
  "explanation": "India does not have a robust scientific or policy mechanism to minimise tiger human conflicts. A Standard Operating Procedure was released by the National Tiger Conservation Authority last year to deal with emergency arising due to straying of tigers to human settlements. The guidelines prohibit killing the tiger unless it has been declared a maneater. Only the chief wildlife warden of a state can permit hunting of man-eaters."
