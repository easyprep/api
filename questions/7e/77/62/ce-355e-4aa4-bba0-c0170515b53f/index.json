  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency is not a part of WHO. It is associated with the International Olympic Committee. The IOC constituted the WADA as a result of the Declaration of Lausanne in 1999. Its role is to monitor and promote the coordination for tackling the doping issue in sports.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe WADA is headquartered in Quebec in Canada. The WADA gave the World Anti- Doping Code according to which the regional and national anti- doping bodies work. The WADA and its code are vital in the Court of Arbitration for Sports adjudication of doping related cases."
