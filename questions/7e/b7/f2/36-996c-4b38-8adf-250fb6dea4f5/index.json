  "question": "As per news in media, Tight oil is now an important driver of growth for most oil majors and oil producing countries. Which among the following statements correctly explains the “tight oil”?",
  "option1": "It is a crude oil that is found in petroleum-bearing shale formations that have relatively low porosity and permeability",
  "option2": "It is an unconventional oil produced from oil shale by pyrolysis, hydrogenation, or thermal dissolution",
  "option3": "It is an unconventional oil obtained from organic-rich fine-grained sedimentary rocks",
  "option4": "It is a colloquial term for high cost petroleum crude due to fluctuations in international crude oil prices.",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "It is a crude oil that is found in petroleum-bearing shale formations that have relatively low porosity and permeability",
  "explanation": "Tight oil is a light hydrocarbon contained in petroleum-bearing shale formations that have relatively low porosity and permeability. Tight oil is extracted at depths of 2 to 3 km on average, with the deepest wells taking up to six weeks to drill. Fracking technology is relatively new but is most developed in the United States, where tight oil production has skyrocketed in last few years. Tight oil should not be confused with oil shale, which contains kerogen. Kerogen is a heavy mixture of organic chemical compounds, the soluble part of which is known as bitumen. Oil shale is a primitive form of oil that has not yet been converted into crude, because the sediment has experienced great heat or high pressure. It is typically found in shallow deposits and is mined, instead of drilled, with a consequent impact on the environment."
