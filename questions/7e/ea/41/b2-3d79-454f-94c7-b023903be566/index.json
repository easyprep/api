  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "The ESZ does not come under Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Even Environment Protection Act, 1986 does not mention the word &#8220;Eco-sensitive Zones&#8221;. The section 3(2)(v) of the Act, says that Central Government can restrict areas in which any industries, operations or processes or class of industries, operations or processes shall not be carried out or shall be carried out subject to certain safeguards Besides the section 5 (1) of this act says that central government can prohibit or restrict the location of industries and carrying on certain operations or processes on the basis of considerations like the biological diversity of an area, maximum allowable limits of concentration of pollutants for an area, environmentally compatible land use, and proximity to protected areas. Thus, all kinds of human activities are not restricted."
