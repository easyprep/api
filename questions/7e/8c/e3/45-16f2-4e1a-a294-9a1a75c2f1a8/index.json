  "question": "A biogas plant works to its maximum capacity at which of the following conditions?",
  "option1": "Conditions are aerobic and temperature 40°C",
  "option2": "Conditions are unerobic and temperature 40°C",
  "option3": "Conditions are aerobic and sewage is supplied",
  "option4": "Conditions are unaerobic and sewage is supplied",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Conditions are unerobic and temperature 40°C",
  "explanation": "Using the highest possible processing temperature is an advantage in anaerobic digestion. The methane-producing bacteria in the digester have a higher rate of activity the higher the temperature. This makes thermophilic (40°C-45°C) biogas production more efficient, with more biogas produced at any given retention time."
