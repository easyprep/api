  "option2": 1908,
  "option3": 1909,
  "option4": 1910,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 1907,
  "explanation": "In the 1907 Annual Session of the Indian National Congress at Surat, the party split into the Radicals Faction (Garam Dal), led by Lal-Bal-Pal (Lala Lajpat Rai of Punjab, Bal Gangadhar Tilak of Maharashtra, and Bipin Chandra Pal of Bengal), and the Moderate Faction (Naram Dal) led by Gopal Krishna Gokhale (mentor of Gandhi) of Maharashtra. Nationalists like Aurobindo Ghose and Chidambaram Pillai supported Tilak. To further their objectives, the Moderates followed 3Ps—Petitions, Prayers, and Protests—without much effect or success. Impatient with the tardy pace, the Radicals advocated radical methods, something the Moderates were not comfortable with. The Radicals wanted agitations, strikes and boycotts, and not just 3 Ps, to force the issues. British put their full weight behind the Moderates, and began to suppress the Radicals—for example, newspapers of the Radicals, including that of Tilak, were suppressed, and Tilak was sent to Mandalay (in Myanmar/Burma) jail for 6 years on charges of sedition."
