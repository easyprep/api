  "question": "There is a Carbon Footprint if a process releases:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Carbon dioxide (CO2)</li>\r\n<li>Methane (CH4)</li>\r\n<li>Nitrous oxide (N2O)</li>\r\n<li>Hydro fluorocarbons (HFCs)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 4",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "Carbon footprint considers all six of the Kyoto Protocol greenhouse gases listed above. However, to simplify matters- and since C0<sub>2</sub> is the most prevalent GHG-these emissions are expressed in terms of C02 equivalent based on a conversion table that uses the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Global Warming Potential (GWP) factors."
