  "answer": "1 & 3 Only",
  "explanation": "Lord Curzon was a great lover of art. He established the department of Archaeology and Epigraphy and passed the ancient monument preservation act in 1904. The Europeans were given a special privilege by an act of 1873 to be tried only by European Magistrates. Lord Ripon tried to remove this unjust discrimination through Ilbert Bill. In 1901, Lord Curzon introduced the Imperial Cadet Corps to impart military training to young civilians."
