It has been continuously making news due to dispute between Taiwan and the Philippines over the ownership of the waters in the region. Also, the continuous military exercise of the Chinese People&rsquo;s Liberation Army-Air Force (PLAAF)&nbsp;over the channel, which is the waterway connecting the South China Sea with the western Pacific Ocean, between Taiwan and the Philippines, has kept it in limelight."
