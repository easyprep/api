  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Maximum duration under Article 356 can be of three years while under Article 352 it may continue indefinitely",
  "explanation": "Article 352: Prior to 44th Amendment Bill 1978, a proclamation of emergency under article 352 could remain in force in the first instance for 2 months. However once approved by the parliament the emergency could remain in force indefinitely. Now, the 44th amendment has cut this power of the executive down. <br /> After the 44th amendment, a proclamation of emergency may remain in force in the first instance for one month. Such Proclamation, if approved by the parliament shall remain in force for a period of 6 months (unless revoked earlier) . For further continuance approval would be required from the parliament for every 6 months. So on approval of the parliament and not on the discretion of the executive the emergency may continue for a longer time."
