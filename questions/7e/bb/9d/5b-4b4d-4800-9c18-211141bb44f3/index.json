  "question": "With respect to the recent notification from the centre about microdot technology, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It is to be used on both automobiles and their parts.</li>\r\n<li>They are used for protecting the vehicles from corrosive damage.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nMicrodot technology is to be used for automobiles and their parts. The technology involves the application of thousands of ‘microdots’ on the product by means of spraying. These are permanent and cannot be removed without damaging the product. The centre recently required the manufacturers to conform to the AIS 155 standards for microdot identifiers.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:   </strong>\r\nMicrodot technology is used for identification purposes. The near invisible identifiers will carry information that can be read using ultraviolet light. This is to reduce cases of automobile theft and circulation of vehicle parts that aren’t original. The rule 92 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules was amended for the introduction."
