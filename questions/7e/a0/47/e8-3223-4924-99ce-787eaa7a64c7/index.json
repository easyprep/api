  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Adjournment Motion is introduced in the Parliament to draw attention of the House to a definite matter of urgent public importance. To be considered, adjournment motion needs the support of 50 members. It is an extraordinary device, which disrupts the normal business of the house. Kindly note that Rajya Sabha is not permitted to make use of adjournment motion, yet there is a similar tool in Rajya Sabha which is called “<strong>Calling Attention</strong>”. The notable difference between the two is that while adjournment motion has an element of censure against the government, <strong>Calling attention</strong> has no such element."
