  "answer": "Diabetes",
  "explanation": "HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin. The HbA1c test is a routine test for people suffering from diabetes (Type1 and Type 2). The normal range of HbA1c is less than 6%. If the percentage of A1c goes above 6%, the person can be said to be suffering from diabetes. Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying pigment that is responsible for the red colour of blood. It is also the predominant protein in red blood cells. About 90% of hemoglobin is hemoglobin A (the \\\"A\\\" stands for adult type). The other types include hemoglobin A1c, A1b, A1a1, and A1a2."
