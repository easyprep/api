  "question": "What is the molecular geometry of HgCl<sub>2</sub>?",
  "option1": "Linear",
  "option2": "Trigonal Planar",
  "option3": "Tetrahedral",
  "option4": "Octahedral",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Linear",
  "explanation": "The molecular geometry of Mercuric chloride (HgCl<sub>2</sub>) is Linear. As there is no lone pairs with Hg and the number of bonding pairs. Therefore, the hybridization is SP hybridization and the structure is Linear."
