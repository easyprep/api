  "answer": "As a Guatemalan artist",
  "explanation": "Carlos Merida was a Guatemalan artist who was one of the first to fuse European modern painting to Latin American themes, especially those related to Guatemala and Mexico. He was part of the Mexican muralism movement in subject matter but less so in style, favouring a non-figurative and later geometric style rather than a figurative, narrative style. MÃ©rida is best known for canvas and mural work, the latter including elements such as glass and ceramic mosaic on major constructions in the 1950s and 1960s.",
