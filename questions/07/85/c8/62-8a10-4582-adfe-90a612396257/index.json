  "option1": "Concession of separate electorates for the Muslims by the Congress Party",

  "option3": "Selection of Muslim leader as the Congress President",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Concession of separate electorates for the Muslims by the Congress Party",
  "explanation": "Merits of Lucknow pact:<br />1. The Lucknow Pact was seen as a beacon of hope for Hindu–Muslim unity.<br />2. It was the first time that the Hindus and Muslims had made a joint demand for political reform to the British. <br />3. It led to a growing belief in British India that Home Rule (self-government) was a real possibility. The most important purpose of the lucknow pact was to achieve Hindu-Muslim unity and generate anti-British feeling. <br /><br />Demerits of Lucknow Pact:<br />1. Since the Congress agreed to the scheme of communal electorates for Muslims, it lost its secular character and the Congress paved the way for future communal tension.<br />2. The Pact provided for Muslim representation in the Councils far in excess of their proportion in the total population.<br />3. With the introduction of “Communal Veto” in legislation, no legislature could proceed with any Bill if three-fourth of the members of a particular community opposed it."
