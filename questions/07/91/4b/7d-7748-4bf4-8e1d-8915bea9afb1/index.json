  "question": "Ammonia:<br> 1. is most soluble gas in water<br> 2. on inhaling causes temporary paralysis of the respiratory muscles<br> 3. can be liquefied by compression at ordinary temperature<br> 4. used as a feedstock for production of fertilizers<br> Which among the above is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "First three statements are correct. Ammonia is a colourless gas with characteristic choking smell, the choking is caused by the temporary paralysis of the respiratory muscles. It is the most soluble gas known. One volume of water at room temperature dissolves roughly 800 volumes of the gas and 1000 volumes at O°e. Ammonia can be liquefied by compression at ordinary temperature. This enables it to be used as a refrigerant in cold storage plants and in the manufacture of ice. In Haber&#8217;s Process Nitrogen (obtained from air) and hydrogen (from water) in the ratio of 1:3 is first compressed to 200 to 500 atmospheres and then passed over a catalyst at a temperature ranging from 450°C to 500°C to manufacture Ammonia. Fourth statement is not correct. Natural Gas is used as feedstock in making of Fertilizers and Natural gas is used for the production of ammonia"
