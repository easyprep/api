  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Maternity Benefit Program is also known as the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana. The program is applicable to the first-born child of women who are 19 years and above. The women are eligible for conditional cash transfer benefits if they fulfil certain criteria.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe immunisation of the child with polio vaccine and BCG vaccine at 6 and 10 weeks is mandatory for the beneficiaries to avail the second cash transfer of 3,000 INR. Additional benefits can be availed if the child is vaccinated against DPT. While this provides incentive for women to adopt healthy practices, some studies show that large number of women get left out.\n&nbsp;"
