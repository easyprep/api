  "question": "With reference to the ongoing discussions about bilateral FTA between India and ASEAN, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The trade between the ASEAN countries and India has decreased.</li>\n<li>India has a trade deficit with ASEAN.</li>\n<li>The AITIGA lets the trade partners set timelines for eliminating duties on goods traded.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nIndia has seen an increase in its trade with the ASEAN countries. Between 2017 and 2018, the bilateral trade has increased by 9.8%. In 2018, the trade stood at 80.8 billion USD. This is because the reduction of trade barriers increases the economic activity among the states.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nIndia has a trade deficit with the ASEAN group. In 2011, the trade deficit was 5 billion USD. In 2017, the deficit doubled to 10 billion USD. Many local players are concerned about dumping of cheap imports. The 16<sup>th</sup> consultations rounds led to the members agreeing to review the conditions in the agreement.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nThe AITIGA/ ASEAN-India trade in goods agreement is to be reviewed to make it friendlier for users and businesses. It allows the member states to set timelines for eliminating duties and trade barriers impeding the trade of maximum goods. This will enable a freer flow of goods between the countries."
