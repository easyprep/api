  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The Reserve Bank of India’s annual report for the year 2016-17 says demonetisation has helped to reduce the country’s currency in circulation (CIC) to GDP ratio. While the cash to GDP ratio in India was 12.2% in 2016, it came down to 8.8% by the end of March 2017 as demonetisation hit the total high value currency in circulation. As per latest report demonetisation has added 9.1 million new taxpayers to the Indian economy. There has been a decline in GVA growth due to lower production by the companies as there was lower demand for goods and services due to currency crunch in the market."
