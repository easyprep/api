  "question": "Which one of the following soil types of India is rendered infertile by the presence of excess iron?",
  "option1": "Desert sand",
  "option2": "Alluvial",
  "option3": "Podzolic",
  "option4": "Lateritic",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Lateritic",
  "explanation": "Lateritic soil types of India are rendered infertile by the presence of excess iron. Laterite soils are those soils which are found in the areas which receive high rainfall and have very high temperature. This results in the less humus content in the soil. Also, they have excess amount of iron in them."
