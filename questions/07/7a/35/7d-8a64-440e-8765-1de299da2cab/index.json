  "question": "Which one of the following forms the chief constituent of Vinegar?",
  "option1": "Formic acid",
  "option2": "Acetic acid",
  "option3": "Salicylic acid",
  "option4": "Oxalic acid",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Acetic acid",
  "explanation": "<p>Vinegar is a liquid substance consisting mainly of acetic acid (CH3CO2H) and water, the acetic acid being produced through the fermentation of ethanol by acetic acid bacteria. It is today mainly used in the kitchen as a general cooking ingredient, but historically, as the most easily available mild acid, it had a great variety of industrial, medical, and domestic uses. Vinegar is a liquid that is produced from the fermentation of ethanol into acetic acid. The fermentation is carried out by bacteria. Vinegar consists of acetic acid (CH3COOH), water and trace amounts of other chemicals, which may include flavourings. The concentration of the acetic acid is variable. Distilled vinegar contains 5-8% acetic acid. Spirit of vinegar is a stronger form of vinegar that contains 5-20% acetic acid. Flavourings may include sweeteners, such as sugar or fruit juices. Infusions of herbs, spices and other flavours may be added, too. Vinegar is made from a variety of source materials. Each contributes its own unique flavour signature to the final product. Vinegar may be made from sugar cane juice, rice and other grains, grapes (balsamic vinegar), coconut water, fruit wines, kombucha, or apple cider. Spirit vinegar is a strong variety of vinegar (5% to 21% acetic acid) made from sugar cane and doubly fermented. The first fermentation changes sugar into alcohol, while the second fermentation changes alcohol into acetic acid.</p>"
