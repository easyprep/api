  "explanation": "Egg whites are a low-calorie, fat-free food. They contain the bulk of the eggâ€™s protein. The egg white contains about 4 grams of protein, 55 mg of sodium and only 17 calories. A single egg white also offers 1.3 micrograms of folate, 6.6 mcg of selenium, 2.3 mg of calcium, 3.6 mg of magnesium, and 4.9 mg of phosphorus and 53.8 mg of potassium. <strong>Egg Yolks</strong> It is true, egg yolks carry the cholesterol, the fat and saturated fat of the egg. However, what is often overlooked are the many nutrients that come with that, such as the fat-soluble vitamins, essential fatty acids and other nutrients. One egg yolk has around 55 calories, 4.5 grams of total fat and 1.6 grams of saturated fat, 210 mg of cholesterol, 8 mg of sodium, and 2.7 grams of protein. <strong>Reference:</strong> <a href=\\\"http://goo.gl/LM0xz3\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">http://goo.gl/LM0xz3</a>"
