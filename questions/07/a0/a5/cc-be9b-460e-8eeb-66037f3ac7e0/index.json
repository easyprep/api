  "question": "The smallest number to be added to 1000, so that 45 divides the sum exactly, is :",
  "option1": 10,
  "option2": 20,
  "option3": 35,
  "option4": 80,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 35,
  "explanation": "$latex 1000 = \\\\left ( 45\\\\times 22 \\\\right )+10$\r\n$latex \\\\therefore 45-10 = 35\\\\ to \\\\ be \\\\ added.$\r\nSo, the smallest number to be added to 1000 to make the sum exactly divisible by 45 is 35, Hence option [C] is correct answer."
