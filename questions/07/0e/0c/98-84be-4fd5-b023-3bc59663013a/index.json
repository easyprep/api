  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about the heating of the earth's atmosphere?<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The atmosphere acts as a transparent medium for the incoming radiation.</li>\n<li>The atmosphere acts as an opaque body for the long-wave radiation.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The incoming energy .i.e. insolation is mostly in the form of short-wave radiation. The earth absorbs short wave radiation during daytime and reflects back the heat received into space as long-wave radiation which is mostly infrared radiation during night.Â <br />The Earth's atmosphere acts as a transparent medium for the incoming radiation and an opaque body for the long wave radiation."
