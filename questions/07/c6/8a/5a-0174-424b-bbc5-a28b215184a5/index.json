  "option2": "Former Member",

  "answer": "Non-member Observer",
  "explanation": "Palestinian foreign minister Riyad al-Malki  has officially declared  that Palestine would apply for full state membership at the United Nations in January 2019. To secure full state membership, the Palestinians need support from at least nine out of the UNSC\\'s 15 member states.  Beside this, Mr Al-Malki  would also demand the UNSC implementation of Resolution 2334 and ask the International Criminal Court (ICC) to open an official inquiry into Israeli settlement construction. According to UNSC Resolution 2334, the UN Secretary General should present the Security Council with a progress report every three months on Israeli settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories. Palestine has been recognized by the UN as a non-member observer state since 2012."
