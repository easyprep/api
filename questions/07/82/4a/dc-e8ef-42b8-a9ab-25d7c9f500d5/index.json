  "question": "Which of these ratios give the viscosity of a fluid?",
  "option1": "ratio of the shearing stress to the velocity gradient",
  "option2": "ratio of the shearing stress to the weight of the fluid",
  "option3": "ratio of the shearing stress to the density of fluid",
  "option4": "ratio of the velocity gradient and shearing stress",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "ratio of the shearing stress to the velocity gradient",
  "explanation": "Viscosity is defined mathematically as the ratio of the shearing stress to the velocity gradient in a fluid. It is represented by the Greek letter <span class=\\'symbol\\'>Î·</span> (eta)."
