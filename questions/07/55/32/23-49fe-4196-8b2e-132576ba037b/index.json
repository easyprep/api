  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Malaysia",
  "explanation": "Malaysia's government proposed new legislation to counter fake news, under which, offender will be penalised with 10-year jail term. The bill defines fake news as any news, information, data and reports presented in the form of print, visuals or audio, which contains wholly or partly false content. Individuals who create, offer, circulate, print or publish fake news or publications containing fake news will be penalised with a 10-year jail term, a fine of up to 500000 ringgit or both. Although incumbent Government has stated that this law is needed to protect public harmony and national security, opposition members consider it as an attack on the press and an attempt to instil fear among people before the general election in August 2018.",
