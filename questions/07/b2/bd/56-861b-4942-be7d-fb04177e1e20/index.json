  "question": "Consider the following statements regarding Zombie Cells:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Formally known as senescent cells, they have been implicated in a number of vector-related diseases</li>\r\n<li>They are very useful in improving the immunity of animals and the humans</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 only",
  "option2": "2 only",
  "option3": "Both 1 and 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "Statement 1 is incorrect: Zombie cells are the ones that cannot die but are equally unable to perform the functions of a normal cell. Formally known as senescent cells, they have been implicated in a number of age-related diseases. Statement 2 is incorrect. Recently, scientists probed the mysteries of zombie cells using a model that imitates aspects of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. When senescent cells were removed, the scientists found that the diseased animals retained the ability to form memories, eliminated signs of inflammation, did not develop what are called neurofibrillary tangles, and had maintained normal brain mass."
