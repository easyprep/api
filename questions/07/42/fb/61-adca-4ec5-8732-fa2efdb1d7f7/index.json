  "question": "Which of the following is / are correct statements with respect to the so called Mohorovicic discontinuity in Earth’s interiors?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It separates the mantle from the Crust</li>\r\n<li>It breaks the waves originating in the mantle</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "The first statement is correct because Mohorovicic discontinuity separates the mantle from the Crust The Upper mantle is fluid in nature and this is the place where all the volcanic activities originate so statement 2 is incorrect. There is a Gutenberg discontinuity between the mantle and the earth’s interior which limits the core and breaks the waves that penetrate from the mantle."
