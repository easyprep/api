  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nHasankeyf is one of the oldest sites to be continuously inhabited by people in the world. It is located along the Tigris River in Turkey. It is a part of the ‘Fertile Crescent’ which is one of the accepted ‘Cradles of Civilisation’.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nDespite the site being under several ancient cultures like Byzantine, Arab, Ottoman, Mesopotamia, etc. and holding many historical artefacts, the site is yet to be declared as a UNESCO heritage site. This is because the state had not officially applied for the listing, though the people have done so."
