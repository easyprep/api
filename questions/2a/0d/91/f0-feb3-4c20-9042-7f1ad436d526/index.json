  "question": "With reference to the talks between India and Malaysia to extradite Zakir Naik, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>India has an extradition treaty with Malaysia.</li>\n<li>In absence of treaty, extradition from India is based on the Indian Extradition Act.</li>\n<li>Malaysia does not extradite its own national to India.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "All are incorrect",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nIndia had entered into an extradition treaty with Malaysia in 2010. This implies that the countries are under treaty obligation to consider extradition requests from the other. An offence that is punishable with at least an imprisonment term of one year is subject to extradition.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nIn the absence of an extradition treaty, a country may allow for extradition but will be subject to provisions of its domestic law. Such a law is the Indian Extradition Act, 1962- which governs the extradition process to non-treaty states.\n<strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe 2010 extradition treaty between India and Malaysia has provisions for extraditing its own nationals. The treaty also covers attempts and conspiracy to commit extraditable offences. If extradition of own national is not done, the applicant state can call for prosecution by competent domestic authorities."
