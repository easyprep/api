It is a Paramyxoviridae- single stranded RNA viruses. It causes a high mortality rate. CDV infection caused the mass deaths of lions in the Gir.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThere are no curative drugs for the infection. The treatment is symptomatic- by use of analgesics, helping with electrolyte balance, anti-convulsants, etc.  The best way is preventive care- by mass vaccinations. This is especially applicable to wild dogs around the national park.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe virus spreads through air mainly. It can also spread by contact or indirect means. Its symptoms include fever, nasal discharge, eye discharge, anorexia, vomiting, convulsions, paralysis, seizures etc. The prevention is using distemper vaccine.
