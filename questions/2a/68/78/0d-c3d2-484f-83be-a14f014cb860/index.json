  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Most tropical woods are hard. They are also heavy. Some of the tropical woods are too heavy to float in water. They are very tough to work on and due to this many tropical countries import wood from middle latitudes for construction and related uses even though they are surplus in timber production. The balsa wood, however, is an exception. This tropical wood is among the lightest in weight and finds application in making boats and canoes."
