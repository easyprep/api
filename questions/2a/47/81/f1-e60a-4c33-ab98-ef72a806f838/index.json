  "answer": "Arjun",
  "explanation": "Arjuna is the modern tank produced by Defence Research and Development, Organisation (DRDO). The Arjun is a third generation main battle tank developed by India\\'s Defence Research and Development Organisation, for the Indian Army. The tank is named after Arjun, the main protagonist, an archer prince of the Indian epic Mahabharata.<br />The Arjun was found to be comparable to the T-90 in almost all respects and better in aspects of mobility - aided in no small measure by its German-made 1,400 horsepower engine which is significantly more powerful than the powerpack employed on the T-90. The invitation to visit the Arjun tank formation was unexpected."
