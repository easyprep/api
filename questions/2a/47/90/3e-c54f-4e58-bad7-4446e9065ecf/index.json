  "question": "With respect to the recent directive from the International Court of Justice in the Gambia vs. Myanmar case, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>‘Intent requirement’ is one of the legal requirements for proving genocide.</li>\n<li>The ICJ ruling on Myanmar cannot be appealed further.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe number of convictions for cases of genocide is very low due to the difficult legal bars set for it. One of these requirements is the ‘intent requirement’. This means there is a need to prove that the genocidal acts were carried out with specific intent to eliminate people on ethnic basis for conviction.\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe recent ICJ ruling on Myanmar is binding. It cannot be appealed further. However, there is no provision for the ICJ to enforce its ruling in the Gambia vs. Myanmar case over the alleged Rohingya genocides. The court directed the Asian country to take steps in accordance with its obligations under the Genocide Convention."
