  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u>. The nodal agency for the implementation of Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojna (SAGY) at the national level is the Ministry of Rural Development and not the Ministry of Panchayati Raj. The District Collector will be the nodal officer for implementing SAGY at the district level. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u>. Under the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojna (SAGY), MPs from Lok Sabha as well as Rajya Sabha are allowed to select a village of their choice for being developed as “Adarsh Gram” but in case of Lok Sabha MP, he/she cannot select elect his own village or village associated with his/her spouse. Nominated MPs may choose a Gram Panchayat from rural area of any district in the country. A Rajya Sabha MP can select a village from the rural area of a district of his/her choice in the State from which he/she is elected."
