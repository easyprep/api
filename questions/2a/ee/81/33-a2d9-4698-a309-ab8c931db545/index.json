  "question": "Which of the following is the basic reason for the extraordinary sparkle of a suitably cut diamond?",
  "option1": "It has a very high transparency",
  "option2": "It has a very high refractive index",
  "option3": "It is very hard",
  "option4": "It has well-defined cleavage planes",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "It has a very high refractive index",
  "explanation": "Diamond has a very high refractive index (about 2.42 compared to about 1.5 for glass). The sparkling isn\\'t just the high refractive index - the shape matters too. Diamonds are cut so that a light ray falling on the diamond is reflected multiple times inside the diamond and therefore sends light out in all directions."
