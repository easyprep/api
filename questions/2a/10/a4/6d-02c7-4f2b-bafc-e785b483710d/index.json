  "option2": "National Pension Scheme",
  "option3": "National Health Scheme",
  "option4": "Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana",
  "explanation": "The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved to enhance target base of Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) from 5 crore to 8 crores. The revised target of PMUY will be achieved by 2020 with an additional allocation of Rs. 4,800 crore. The decision comes in the wake of the huge response to PMUY from the women particularly in rural areas and to cover such households not having LPG connection. This move will address practical difficulty faced in implementation of MUY, namely, targeting genuinely poor households left out of Socio-Economic Cards.",
