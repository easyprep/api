  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The ocean floors can be divided into four major divisions: <ol> <li>The Continental Shelf;</li> <li>The Continental Slope;</li> <li>The Deep Sea Plain;</li> <li>The Oceanic Deeps.</li> </ol> Besides, these divisions there are also major and minor relief features in the ocean floors like ridges, hills, sea mounts, guyots, trenches, canyons, etc. Continental Shelf is the extended margin of each continent occupied by relatively shallow seas and gulfs. Continental Slope connects the continental shelf and the ocean basins. It begins where the continental shelf sharply drops off into a steep slope. Deep sea plains are gently sloping areas of the ocean basins. These are the flattest and smoothest regions of the world. Oceanic Deeps or Trenches are the deepest parts of the oceans. They are relatively steep sided, narrow basins. A guyot also known as a tablemount is an isolated underwater volcanic mountain (seamount), with a flat top over 200 meters (660 feet) below the surface of the sea. The diameters of these flat summits can exceed 10 km (6.2 mi)."
