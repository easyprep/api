  "answer": "Only 1 & 4",
  "explanation": "Four Northeast Indian states share the border with Myanmar: Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Mizoram and Manipur. The entire border length touches Arunachal Pradesh (520 km), Nagaland (215 km), Manipur (398 km) and Mizoram (510 km). The Indiaâ€“Myanmar border has been frequently in news due to its porous nature and cross-border movement of militants and Rohingyas from Myanmar into India. Besides these, the border is also used for trade of illicit drugs, cannabis herbs, ganja and banned pseudoephedrine tablets. Recently, the governments of both the countries have decided to seal the 1643-km-long border."
