  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "Thr first statement is correct. Although executive has a say in the appointments because judges of Supreme Court are appointed by the President, who works on advice of executive only. But along with that the judiciary itself has to be consulted. Thus, there is no “absolute” discretion of the executive in this matter.<br />The second statement is partially correct. Though these charges are non-votable but they can be discussed in parliament.<br />Third statement is correct. The constitution prohibits any discussion in Parliament or in a State Legislature with respect to the conduct of the judges of the Supreme Court in the discharge of their normal duty. However, during removal process, it can be discussed."
