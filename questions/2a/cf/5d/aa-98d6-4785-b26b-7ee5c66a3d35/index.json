The Greek struggle and victory against the Italians received exuberant praise at the time. Most prominent is the quote attributed to Winston Churchill: \"Hence we will not say that Greeks fight like heroes, but we will say that heroes fight like Greeks.\" French general Charles de Gaulle was among those who praised the fierceness of the Greek resistance.",
