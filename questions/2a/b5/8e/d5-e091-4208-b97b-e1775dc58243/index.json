  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Camel",
  "explanation": "Camels store fat in their humps, not water. As a camel goes without food, its hump begins to shrink. Until recently, many scientists believed that camels could store water in one of their three stomachs. Very thirsty camels can drink up to 100 liters of water during a single visit to the well."
