  "question": "The 15 point reform charter was given by the Vice President. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Reservation for women in the legislature is one of the points focused upon.</li>\n<li>The issue of quorum is also addressed by the charter.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe 15 point reform charter given by the Vice President includes a call for reservation of seats in legislature for women. While the grass-root level administrative bodies have reservation for women, the union parliament is yet to implement any such reservations.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe charter called for the adoption of a roster system to ensure attendance to the sessions. The parties are to ensure the attendance of at least 50% of their legislators. This is because low quorum (less than 10% of house strength) will lead to adjournment of the session."
