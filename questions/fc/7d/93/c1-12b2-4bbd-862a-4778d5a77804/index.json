The Ministry will use a study on the status of tiger habitats in high altitude ecosystems to have a high altitude tiger master plan. The report provides the action strategy for a high altitude tiger master plan with gainful portfolio for local communities and ensuring centrality of tiger conservation in development, through an effective coordination mechanism, involving stakeholders and line departments operating within the landscape.  The study is led by the Global Tiger Forum (GTF) with range country governments of Bhutan, India and Nepal. It is also supported by the Integrated Tiger Habitat Conservation Programme (ITHPC) of the IUCN and KfW (German Development Bank). The GTF is the only intergovernmental and international body established with members from willing countries to embark on a global campaign to protect the Tiger. Its headquarters is located in New Delhi."
