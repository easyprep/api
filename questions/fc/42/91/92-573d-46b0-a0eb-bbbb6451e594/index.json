  "question": "Traditionally, paddy is grown by planting seeds in a small nursery and then the saplings are manually transplanted to the main cultivation area. However, in recent times, there has been emphasis on the direct seeding methodology for paddy cultivation. What advantages can be offered by such methodology?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It can bring down water consumption</li>\r\n<li>It can bring down production cost</li>\r\n<li>It can reduce emission of Green House Gases</li>\r\n<li>It can substantially improve production</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",

  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 4",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Traditionally, paddy is grown by planting seeds in a small nursery and then the sapling are manually trans planted after about four weeks to the main cultivation area. The saplings are then allowed to grow and the fields are kept under 3 to 4 inches of water, mainly to reduce growing of weeds. This ‘puddle irrigation’ requires high consumption of water. However, the \\'Direct Seeding\\' methodology, that sows the seeds directly in the fields, has shown a substantial reduction in water consumption and also in the production cost. The Direct seeding also has the additional environmental benefit of reducing emission of greenhouse gases like Methane apart from improving soil porosity which can increase productivity of the succeeding crop. The methodology saves about 40-50per cent of water in the direct seeded fields and can reduce farmers cultivation cost by a staggering Rs 5,000per hectare, as no manual labour is required to transplant paddy besides machinery and electricity costs."
