It is the first international instrument to deal with the issues of crime committed through internet. It provides for criminalisation of issues like child pornography, computer fraud etc.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nIndia is not a signatory to the Budapest Convention. However, 64 countries have ratified the treaty. The main concern for India is that the treaty allows cross- border access to data and that it wasn’t involved in the negotiation process."
