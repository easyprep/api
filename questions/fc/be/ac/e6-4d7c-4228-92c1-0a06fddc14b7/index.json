This decision is expected to give a boost to defence exports and enhance Ease of doing Business (EDB). The transfer of technology to the countries is subject to the condition that the export is an intra-company transfer from an Indian subsidiary (applicant exporter) to its foreign parent company and or to subsidiaries of the foreign parent company. The OGEL is a one-time export licence to be granted to a company for a specific period which would initially be only two years."
