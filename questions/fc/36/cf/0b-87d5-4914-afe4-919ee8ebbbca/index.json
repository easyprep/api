This year, in 2017, the day will focus on engaging and mobilizing people throughout the world to show support for refugees and migrants. Its messages will be shared with communities hosting refugees and migrants as well as people concerned that refugees and migrants may bring physical and economic insecurity to their lives. The day will highlight solidarity with refugees and migrants and showcase the shared benefits of migration to economies and nations, while also acknowledging legitimate concerns of host communities. The 2017 theme “Together for Peace: Respect, Safety and Dignity for All” honours the spirit of ‘TOGETHER’, a global initiative that promotes respect, safety and dignity for everyone forced to flee their homes in search of a better life."
