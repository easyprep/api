The aim of the pilot project is to reduce deaths to near zero levels on this particular stretch. The project will entail a scientific study to reduce the conflict involving pedestrians and cyclists on one hand and the cars and heavy vehicles on the other. The initiative is to be run in partnership with SaveLIFE Foundation, a leading road safety non-profit organization."
