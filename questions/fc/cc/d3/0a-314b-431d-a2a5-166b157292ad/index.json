  "option1": "Nitric oxide",
  "option2": "Nitrous oxide",
  "option3": "Nitrogen penta oxide",
  "option4": "Nitrogen",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Nitrous oxide",
  "explanation": "Nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas, is a chemical compound with the formula N2O. It is an oxide of nitrogen.\r\nAt room temperature, it is a colorless, non-flammable gas, with a slightly sweet odor and taste. It is used in surgery and dentistry for its anaesthetic and analgesic effects. It is known as “laughing gas” due to the euphoric effects of inhaling it, a property that has led to its recreational use as a dissociative anesthetic.\r\nNitrous oxide gives rise to NO (nitric oxide) on reaction with oxygen atoms, and this NO in turn reacts with ozone. As a result, it is the main naturally occurring regulator of stratospheric ozone. It is also a major greenhouse gas and air pollutant."
