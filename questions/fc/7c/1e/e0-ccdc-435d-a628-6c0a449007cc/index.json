  "question": "Which country adds 24 GW in just two months making it biggest producer of solar energy?",
  "option1": "China",
  "option2": "Indonesia",
  "option3": "Japan",
  "option4": "Thailand",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "China",
  "explanation": "Renewable energy use is increasing day by day almost everywhere. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also weighed on the increase in the use of solar power and also brought 'Suryaputra' nations together for better and cleaner future. Solar energy use was noted by China when the country managed to add 10.52 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity to its national total over the course of July 2017, in addition to the 24.4 GW of capacity that was installed over the first six months of the year. The country is already the biggest producer of solar energy in the world, and that doesn't seem likely to change anytime soon. In the last two months alone, China has added 24.02 GW of solar capacity. To put that into context, figures from earlier this year put Australia's total capacity at around 6GW, a figure that's projected to double by 2020.",
