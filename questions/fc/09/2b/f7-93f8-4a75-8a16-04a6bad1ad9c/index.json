Soon, the project is to be inaugurated by President Pranab Mukherjee.  The smart grid will be synchronised to generate power from solar, wind and vegetable waste resources, depending on the weather conditions and availability of waste products. The power to be generated from solar energy depends on the availability of sunlight, while wind energy will be produced during nor\\'wester and tropical storm. The power from biogas will be generated from vegetable waste collected from the campus kitchen and outside markets."
