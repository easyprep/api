  "answer": "Chris Gayle",
  "explanation": "West Indies opener Chris Gayle has become the first-ever player to smash 500 sixes in international cricket. He achieved this feat in the ongoing 5-match One Day International (ODI) series against England at National Cricket Stadium in Grenada, West Indies on 27 February.  However, Gayle’s fireworks weren’t enough to help his team cross the line as West Indies were bowled out for 389. They fell 29 runs short of England’s 418/6, scored courtesy Jos Buttler’s 150 and Eoin Morgan’s 103 as well as half-centuries by Jonny Bairstow and Alex Hales. Earlier in the ongoing series, he had toppled Shahid Afridi to record the most number of sixes by any batsman in international cricket. Gayle, who will retire from ODIs after the 2019 Cricket World Cup, now has 506 sixes in international cricket (98 in Tests, 305 in ODIs and 103 in T20Is). He also breached 10,000-run mark in ODIs and become only the 2nd from West Indies after Brian Lara (10,405 runs) to achieve the milestone."
