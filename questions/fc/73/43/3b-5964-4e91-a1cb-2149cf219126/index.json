  "question": "Which one of the following is paramagnetic in nature?",
  "option1": "Iron",
  "option2": "Hydrogen",
  "option3": "Oxygen",
  "option4": "Nitrogen",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Oxygen",
  "explanation": "The reason that it is paramagnetic is because the oxygen molecule has two unpaired electrons. Electrons not only go around the atom in their orbitals, they also spin, which creates a magnetic field. Unpaired electrons spin in the same direction as each other, which increases the magnetic field effect."
