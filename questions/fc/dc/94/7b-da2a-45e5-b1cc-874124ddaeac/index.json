  "question": "With respect to lightning, which of the following is / are correct observations?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>One should always use an umbrella while crossing an open field in a thunderstorm</li>\r\n<li>Lightning primarily occurs when warm air is mixed with colder air masses</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "The first statement is not correct. One should not use an umbrella while crossing an open field in a thunderstorm because when a charged cloud passes over an umbrella, it induces a charge in it, and there is an electrical discharge between an umbrella and the cloud, which may be very dangerous. Second statement is correct. About 70% of lightning occurs over land in the tropics where atmospheric convection is the greatest. This occurs from both the mixture of warmer and colder air masses, as well as differences in moisture concentrations, and it generally happens at the boundaries between them.When two clouds carrying opposite charges approach each other, a charge flows from one to the other through the air. This electrical discharge which can be seen as a dazzling flash of light is called lightning. When lightning occurs the air suddenly gets very hot and expands. It subsequently cools and contracts. This sudden and tremendous expansion and contraction of air produces an explosion of loud sound which is called thunder."
