  "question": "ISRO has successfully launched navigation satellite IRNSS-1I into the orbit from which launch vehicle?",
  "option1": "PSLV-C41",
  "option2": "PSLV-C43",
  "option3": "PSLV-C42",
  "option4": "PSLV-C44",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "PSLV-C41",
  "explanation": "The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has successfully launched the navigation satellite IRNSS-1I into the orbit with the help of PSLV-C41 launch vehicle from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) at Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh on April 12, 2018. IRNSS-1I is the 8th such satellite to be a part of the NavIC navigation satellite constellation. It is expected to replace IRNSS-1A, the first of the seven navigation satellites, which was rendered ineffective after its three rubidium atomic clocks failed. The IRNSS 1I mission is critical for the space agency as it is ISROâ€™s second attempt to replace the IRNSS 1A satellite, after the failure of the IRNSS 1H mission in August 2017. The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) is a constellation of seven satellites that provides indigenously developed regional GPS services called NavIC."
