That means, he should be a citizen of India and a judge of some high court for five years or an advocate of some high court for ten years or should be an eminent jurist, in the opinion of the president.<br />• The constitution does not provide for fixed tenure to the AG. So, he holds office during the pleasure of the president. He can be removed by the president at any time.

The constitution has not fixed the remuneration of the AG."
