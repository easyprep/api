  "question": "Which of the following define Biofilms?",
  "option1": "Colour films used by biologists to photograph living organisms",
  "option2": "photomicrographs of microorganisms from various habitats",
  "option3": "accumulations of microorganisms at surfaces such as those of a rock, a tooth or an oil droplet",
  "option4": "photographic films made through fermentation processes of certain industrial microorganisms",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "accumulations of microorganisms at surfaces such as those of a rock, a tooth or an oil droplet",
  "explanation": "A biofilm comprises any syntrophic consortium of microorganisms in which cells stick to each other and often also to a surface. These adherent cells become embedded within a slimy extracellular matrix that is composed of extracellular polymeric substances. Microorganisms that form <em>biofilms</em> include bacteria, fungi and protists. One common example of a <em>biofilm</em> dental plaque, a slimy buildup of bacteria that forms on the surfaces of teeth."
