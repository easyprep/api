  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "LNG is liquefied natural gas. Natural gas is a mixture of hydrocarbons, composed primarily of methane. When natural gas is cooled to a temperature of approximately &#8211; 260 degree F at atmospheric pressure, it condenses to a liquid called liquefied natural gas (LNG). One volume of this liquid takes up about 1/600th the volume of natural gas at a stove burner tip. LNG weighs about 45% as much as water of a similar volume. LNG is odourless, colourless, non-corrosive, and non-toxic. Natural gas is a naturally occurring gas mixture composed primarily of methane (typically, at least 90%), but may also contain ethane, propane and heavier hydrocarbons. LNG does not have an odor. However, manufacturers often add traces of a substance like T-butyl mercaptan to give it a foul smell."
