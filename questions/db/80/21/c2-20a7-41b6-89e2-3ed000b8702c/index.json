  "answer": "Georgia",
  "explanation": "South Ossetia officially the Republic of South Ossetiaâ€“the State of Alania, or the Tskhinvali Region, is a de facto state in the South Caucasus recognised by most countries as part of Georgia. The separatist polity, the Republic of South Ossetia (or the State of Alania), is recognized as a state by Russia, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Nauru, and Syria. While Georgia lacks control over South Ossetia, the Georgian government and most members of the United Nations consider the territory part of Georgia, whose constitution designates the area as \"the former autonomous district of South Ossetia\", in reference to the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast disbanded in 1990."
