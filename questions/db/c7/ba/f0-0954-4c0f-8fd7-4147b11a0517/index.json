  "question": "With reference to the survey on Odonate population in Kerala, consider the following statements about their significance in nature:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Dragonfly population is indicative of the aquatic habitat health of a region.</li>\n<li>While dragonflies feed on mosquitoes, damselflies do not.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nDragonfly population is indicative of the health of the aquatic environment in that region. This is because they spend a major part of their lives in the water- in form of eggs and larva. The survey showed a decrease in the Odonate population in Kerala. The drop has been attributed to the flooding which may have washed away the larvae and eggs.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nBoth dragonflies and damselflies feed on mosquitoes. They are priced for their role of pest controller. The Odonates feed on mosquitoes even before reaching maturity i.e. in their larval stage. While the adult Odonates feed during the day, the larval forms feed on the mosquito larvae."
