  "explanation": "Identification of Dengue Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which spread Dengue virus prefer to breed in man made containers. It can be recognized by white markings on leg. Dengue mosquito is a day biting mosquito. The dengue viruses are the only known arboviruses that have fully adapted to humans and do not need an animal reservoir, although dengue has been observed to also circulate in nonhuman primates. They are transmitted from human-to-human by the urban-dwelling Aedes aegypti mosquito, which has adapted to humans, laying their eggs in artificial containers in and around houses and feeding only on humans, and by Ae albopictus (the Asian tiger mosquito) and Ae polynesiensis. These latter mosquitoes feed on birds, reptiles, rats, cows, and humans. DV may be transmitted vertically from the female mosquito to her offspring. Most cases of transmission from human-to-human are through female mosquitoes which previously became infected when feeding on an infected person. Only Females spread the disease."
