  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The Surface Zone is also called as the Photic zone or the Euphoric Zone. It contains about 2 percent of the total volume of water in the ocean. It is limited to a depth of about 100 meters.<br />Thermocline: It lies between 100 metres and 1000 metres. It contains about 18 percent of the total volume of water in the ocean.<br />Deep Zone: This zone lies below 1000 metres in the mid-latitudes. This zone contains about 80 percent of the total volume of water in the ocean."
