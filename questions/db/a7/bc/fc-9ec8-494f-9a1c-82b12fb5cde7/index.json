  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe core sector industries are those that are of vital importance to the economy. There are 8 core sector industries of varying weightage: refinery products, electricity, steel, coal, crude oil, natural gas, cement and fertilisers. Of these the highest weightage is given to petroleum and refinery products industries.    \n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe fertiliser industry was the only core industry to record a positive growth during the period. All other sectors showed a reduction in performance. The worst performing sector of the period was the coal industry. The reasons attributed were increase in renewable energy production, labour issues and extended monsoon."
