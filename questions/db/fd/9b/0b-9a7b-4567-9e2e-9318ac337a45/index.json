  "answer": "Density",
  "explanation": "Density refers to the amount of mass per unit volume of substance. It is generally measured in g/cm3.<br />Since the salt water has some dissolved substances in it, its density is slightly higher than pure water.<br />The density of sea water gradually increases with decreasing temperature and highest density is recorded at the temperature of -1.3Â° C."
