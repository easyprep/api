With this, the States decided to accept the jurisdiction of a permanent international criminal court for the prosecution of the perpetrators of the most serious crimes committed in their territories or by their nationals after the entry into force of the Rome Statute on 1 July 2002. Both India and China are non party and non-signatory states. Russia has recently withdrawn from the Rome statute of the international criminal court."
