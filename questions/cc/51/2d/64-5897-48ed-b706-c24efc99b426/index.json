  "question": "In reference to the recent revision of Khadi Rumal stitching charges for women, consider the following statements about Rumals:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Rumals are long shawls manufactured in Jammu and Kashmir.</li>\n<li>Rumals are made of cotton.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nKhadi Rumals are handkerchiefs manufactured in Jammu and Kashmir. The Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) had set up Rumal stitching centre in Nagrota- a militancy affected area in J&amp;K- in 2016. The move was aimed at providing economic assistance to the women of this militancy hit small town.  \n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Rumals are made of cotton. The KVIC had set a target of selling 5 crore Rumals and this would consume 15 lakh kg of cotton for its production. The KVIC recently approved the increase of stitching charges for these Rumals from 2 INR per piece to 3 INR per piece. This would result in a 50% income increase for the women."
