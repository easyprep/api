  "question": "Tulagi Island, sometimes seen in news, is the territory of which country?",
  "option1": "Kiribati",
  "option2": "Solomon",
  "option3": "Tuvalu",
  "option4": "Nauru",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Solomon",
  "explanation": "A Chinese company “Sam Enterprise Group” has signed a secretive deal with the  government of the Solomon Islands to lease an entire Tulagi island for up to 75 years but the status of the lease remains unclear since it is a non-binding agreement. The deal was signed just a few days after the Solomon Islands abandoned Taiwan and began diplomatically recognizing Chinese aid and investment to flow. The purpose of the deal is to establish a Pacific military base on a strategic gateway to Australia. The island of Tulagi served as a South Pacific headquarters for Britain and then Japan. It is the site of a former Japanese naval base and was the scene of fierce fighting in World War II."
