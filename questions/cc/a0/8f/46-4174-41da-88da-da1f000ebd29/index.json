  "question": "Due to which of the following reasons the Superconductors are so called?",
  "option1": "Efficiently conduct heat from one hot body to another",
  "option2": "Offer no resistance to conduction of heat at high temperatures",
  "option3": "Offer no resistance to conduction of electricity at low temperatures",
  "option4": "Produce high temperatures while conducting electricity",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Offer no resistance to conduction of electricity at low temperatures",
  "explanation": "It takes a significant amount of energy to scatter an electron from the condensate – more than the thermal energy available to an electron below the critical temperature – so the superconducting electrons can flow without being scattered, that is, without any resistance."
