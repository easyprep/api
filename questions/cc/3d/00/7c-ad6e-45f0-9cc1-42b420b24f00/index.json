  "option1": "Germany",
  "option2": "Belgium",
  "option3": "Ireland",
  "option4": "Russia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Germany",
  "explanation": "Germany's UNESCO World Heritage Site is \"Cologne Cathedral\". Begun in 1248, the building of this Gothic masterpiece took place in several stages and was not completed until 1880. Over seven centuries, its successive builders were inspired by the same faith and by a spirit of absolute fidelity to the original plans. Apart from its exceptional intrinsic value and the artistic masterpieces it contains, Cologne Cathedral bears witness to the strength and endurance of European Christianity. No other Cathedral is so perfectly conceived, so uniformly and uncompromisingly executed in all its parts. Cologne Cathedral is a High Gothic five-aisled basilica, with a projecting transept and a towering facade. The western section, nave and transept were begun in 1330, changes in style, but this is not perceptible in the overall building. The 19th-century work follows the medieval forms and techniques faithfully, as can be seen by comparing it with the original medieval plan on parchment."
