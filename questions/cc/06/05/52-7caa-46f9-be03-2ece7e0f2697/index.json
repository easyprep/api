  "question": "A combination of contouring and crop rotation in which alternate rows are constructed perpendicular to the wind and water flow to prevent soil erosion is called _?",
  "option1": "Strip cropping",
  "option2": "Mulching",
  "option3": "Vegetated waterways",
  "option4": "Terracing",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Strip cropping",
  "explanation": "Strip cropping is a very effective and inexpensive method for controlling soil erosion. It is a combination of contouring and crop rotation. Alternate strips of row crops and soil conserving crops are grown on the same slope, perpendicular to the wind or the water flow. It helps to reduce surface run-off."
