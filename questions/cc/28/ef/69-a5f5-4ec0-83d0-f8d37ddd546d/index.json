  "question": "A person with “Bombay Blood group” can receive blood from a person who is from____?",
  "option1": "A Group or B Group",
  "option2": "AB Group",
  "option3": "O Group",
  "option4": "None of them",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of them",
  "explanation": "Bombay Blood Group is an extremely rare ABO group, called so because it was first discovered among some people in Bombay. Their red cells lack ABH antigens and their sera contain anti-A and anti-B and anti-H. The anti-H would not be detected in the ABO group but would be detectable in pretransfusion tests. People who have Bombay phenotype can donate to any member of the ABO blood group system (unless some other blood factor gene, such as Rhesus, is incompatible), but they cannot receive any member of the ABO blood group system`s blood (which always contains one or more of A and B and H antigens), but only from other people who have Bombay phenotype"
