  "question": "The Diel Vertical Migration was measured using a NASA project for the first time. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The Diel Vertical Migration occurs in the marine ecosystem.</li>\n<li>It causes increased release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Diel Vertical Migration is the process by which marine animals from the ocean depths reach the surface water at night for feeding on the phyto-planktons. This is a diurnal phenomenon and the animals return to the depths at sun rise again. Recently, the NASA project CALIPSO measured the migration around the world.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe DVM is an integral part of the carbon cycle. The phytoplanktons are autotrophic organisms that convert carbon dioxide into starch by photosynthesis. The animals feed on these planktons and take them down to the ocean depths. There the captured carbon is deposited. Thus DVM acts as a carbon pump from the surface to the depths."
