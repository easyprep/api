  "question": "With respect to the recent SC petitions against the lack of domestic protection provided to the wetlands in India, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Ramsar Convention considers coral reefs as wetlands too.</li>\n<li>The World Wetland Day is celebrated in February.</li>\n<li>India has a Central Wetland Regulatory Authority for regulating activities surrounding important wetlands.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nRamsar Convention considers a wide range of water- bodies as ‘wetlands’- lakes, rivers, mangroves, marshes, floodplains and even coral reefs and marine areas. However, these marine areas should not be deeper than 6m at low tide to be covered by the convention.\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe World Wetland Day is observed on February 2<sup>nd</sup> every year. The date commemorates the adoption of the Ramsar Convention in Ramsar, Iran. The 2020 edition’s theme is ‘Wetlands and Biodiversity’. This year, 10 wetlands from India have been declared as ‘Ramsar Sites’.\n<strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong>\nIndia does not have a Central Wetland Regulatory Authority, though the 2010 Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules had called for its establishment. India currently has a National Wetlands Committee- though its function is purely advisory. New regulations have removes several water-bodies from what constitutes a ‘wetland’ for protection by these rules such as lagoons, backwaters, creeks and estuaries.\n&nbsp;"
