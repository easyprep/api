  "question": "IPCC predicted that the sea level may rise by 1.1m by 2100. With reference to this, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The sea level rise would not happen if the emissions are restricted now.</li>\n<li>Increased warming of the seas will decrease oxygen availability to marine life.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change submitted that if the emissions are not curbed, the sea level would rise by 1.1m by 2100. Even if the emissions are restricted now, the seas would rise by 30cm to 60cm by the year 2100. This is expected to affect about 680 million people.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe warming of the seas will retard the mixing of the water layers. This will prevent the oxygen rich upper layers from transferring the life-sustaining gas and other nutrients and marine food to the lower levels of the seas. This will drastically affect the marine life forms."
