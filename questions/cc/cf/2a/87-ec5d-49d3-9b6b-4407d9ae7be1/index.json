  "answer": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe NLD was launched as a ‘one stop solution’ for all testing needs and can be used by industries, researchers, regulatory officers and other stakeholders. The directory currently links 4,500 labs. Labs assessed by BIS, NABL, Hallmark, APEDA, FSSAI, etc. are recognised by NLD.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe CRSBIS is a compulsory registration scheme under BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards). The manufacture of certain products require the manufacturers to acquire BIS license after being tested by BIS recognised labs. These products include electronics (15 categories), solar photovoltaics, components, etc.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nThe ManakOnline is an e-governance solution developed by CDAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing) for BIS. It allows the online application for grant of license from BIS. The system has provisions for automatic selection of inspection date and officers to eliminate biases."
