  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 Only",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u>. Vegetable Grafting is a centuries-old unique horticultural technique practised for many years in East Asia to overcome issues related to agricultural productivity. This technology was introduced to Europe and other countries in the late 20th century. It reduces disease susceptibility and increases plant vigour, thereby increasing its longevity as well as yield and reducing losses for vegetable farmers and increasing their revenue. It also provides resistant to plants against soil-borne diseases. <u>Second statement is correct.</u> Vegetable grafting involves cutting the stem of a vegetable plant at the seedling stage and attaching it to the rootstock of the seedling of a vegetable plant like wild brinjal or pumpkin."
