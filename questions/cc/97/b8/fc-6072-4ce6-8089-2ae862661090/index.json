  "question": "World Gold Council reported that India is one of the top 10 nations with respect to gold reserves. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>IMF holds the highest gold reserve in the world.</li>\n<li>The India is adding to its gold reserve as a part of de-dollarisation of forex reserves.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:<strong> </strong>",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe highest gold reserve is held by USA. It has a reserve of 8,331.5 tonnes of gold reserves. IMF is the third largest holder. India had recently entered the top ten and is at the 10<sup>th</sup> spot. If only individual countries are considered, India would be the 9<sup>th</sup> largest holder of gold reserves.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nIndia and other developing countries have been adding to their gold reserve to de-dollarise the forex reserve. A large part of India’s forex reserve is in form of dollars and given the trade tensions, countries are keen to diversify the reserves. Gold is a very liquid and safe asset and many countries have been adding to their gold reserves, especially China.\n&nbsp;"
