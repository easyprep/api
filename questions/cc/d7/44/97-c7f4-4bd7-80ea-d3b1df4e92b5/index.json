  "question": "&nbsp; &nbsp;Jet Streams are: <ol> <li>the strongest surface winds available on earth</li> <li>best developed in summers</li> <li>found only in northern hemisphere and are absent in southern hemisphere</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "None",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None",
  "explanation": "First statement is incorrect because jet streams are upper atmosphere winds. They are high altitude examples of geostrophic winds moving parallel between isobars. The best known jet stream is polar jet stream which flows in tropopause. Second statement is incorrect because both polar jet streams and subtropical jet streams are best developed in winter when temperature exhibit steepest gradient. Third statement is also incorrect because jet streams are found in both hemispheres."
