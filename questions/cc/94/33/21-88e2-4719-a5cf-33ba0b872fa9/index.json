  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe task force was set up to look into the possibility of setting up a secondary market for loans. The report presented absence of a loan sales platform, lack of standardisation of documentation, legal factors, etc. to be major impediments for this market. To tackle this, it recommends setting up an online loan sale platform.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe task force recommends the setting up of a central loan contract registry. This will deal with deciding the technological, infrastructure, structural aspects, etc. of this new market. A self-regulatory body (SRB) will be responsible for standardisation of the documentation."
