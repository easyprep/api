  "answer": "Arctic ocean",
  "explanation": "The scientists from 17 nations will take part in the year-long MOSAiC mission as they anchor the ship to a large piece of Arctic sea ice to study climate change. The German icebreaker RV Polarstern will be the base for scientists studying the impact of climate change on the Arctic and how it could affect the rest of the world. The MOSAiC mission stands for Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate. It comes about 125 years after Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen first managed to seal his wooden expedition ship (Fram) into the ice during a three-year expedition to the North Pole.  The mission has received funding from U.S. institutions such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Department of Energy, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and NASA."
