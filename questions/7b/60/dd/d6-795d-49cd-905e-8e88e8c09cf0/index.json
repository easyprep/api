  "option5": "",
  "answer": "It blames Jawaharlal Nehru’s Forward Policy for India’s defeat to China in 1962",
  "explanation": "The Henderson Brooks report is a secret document based on Indo-China war of 1962. The report blames the then Jawarharlal Nehru government’s ill-conceived and ill-timed “Forward Policy”, and lack of proper intelligence or adequate military preparation, for India’s abject defeat in 1962. It became a buzzword when an Australian journalist and author Neville Maxwell had suddenly released a major chunk of the report, and since then the BJP had continuously attacked the Congress for compromising with the country’s military preparedness in the past as well as the present. There were several requests made in parliament to make the report public but the government denied it stating it a top-secret."
