  "option1": "Taiwan",
  "option2": "Lebanon",
  "option3": "Timor-Leste",
  "option4": "Jordan",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Taiwan",
  "explanation": "Taiwan has become the first Asian country to recognize same sex marriage after the constitutional courtâ€™s ruling comes in support of legalizing same-sex marriage. The panel of judges has given the island\\'s parliament two years to amend or enact new laws, which could potentially make Taiwan the first place in Asia to allow same-sex marriage. It must be noted that South Africa is the only country in Africa to permit same-sex marriage."
