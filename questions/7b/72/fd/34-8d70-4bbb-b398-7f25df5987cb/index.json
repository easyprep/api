  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Ghana",
  "explanation": "The Black Star of Africa is a black five-pointed star symbolizing Africa in general and Ghana in particular. The Black Star Line, founded in 1919 by Marcus Garvey as part of the Back-to-Africa movement, modelled its name on that of the White Star Line, changing the colour from white to black to symbolise ownership by black people rather than white people. The black star became a symbol of Pan-Africanism and anti-colonialism. Described as the \"Lodestar of African Freedom\", the black star was used in 1957 by Theodosia Okoh in the design of the Flag of Ghana.",
