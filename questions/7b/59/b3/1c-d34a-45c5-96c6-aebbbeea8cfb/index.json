  "question": "A tap can empty a tank in one hour. A second tap can empty it in 30 minutes. If both the taps operate simultaneously, how much time is needed to empty the tank?",
  "option1": "45 minutes",
  "option2": "20 minutes",
  "option3": "30 minutes",
  "option4": "40 minutes",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "20 minutes",
  "explanation": "1 hour = 60 minutes \r\nRate of emptying the tank by the two taps are $latex \\\\frac{1}{60}&s=1$ and $latex \\\\frac{1}{30}&s=1$ of the tank per minute respectively. \r\nRate of emptying the tank when both operate simultaneously =\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{1}{60} + \\\\frac{1}{30} = \\\\frac{1+2}{60} = \\\\frac{3}{60} = \\\\frac{1}{20}&s=1$ \r\nof the tank per minute.\r\nâˆ´ Time taken by the two taps together to empty the tank = 20 minutes.\r\nHence option [B] is the right answer."
