  "question": "Strait of Hormuz has been in the news for its major role as a geopolitical tool, especially in the oil trade. In this context, which of the following statements are correct?\n<ol>\n<li>It links the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf.</li>\n<li>It links the Gulf of Aden and the Persian Gulf.</li>\n<li>The narrow strait is used as a shipping corridor based on the Traffic Separation Scheme.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "All of the above",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 and 3",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe strait connects the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf. It is bordered by Iran, UAE and Musandam- a governorate of Oman. It is the site of passage for large number of oil tankers. About 20% of worldâ€™s oil passes through this strait. It has previously been the site of tanker wars.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Gulf of Aden is located south of Yemen- on the other side of Arabian Peninsula with respect to the Strait of Hormuz. The Aden gulf also holds a strategic chokepoint similar to this strait- called the Bab-el-mandab strait. This connects the Gulf of Aden to the Red sea.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe Hormuz strait is very narrow and given the high shipping traffic, is prone to accidents. Hence the ships follow TSS/ traffic separation system. It uses lanes of about 2 miles wide and separation of lanes is by medians, which are also 2 miles wide. The inbound traffic uses a separate lane from the outbound traffic."
