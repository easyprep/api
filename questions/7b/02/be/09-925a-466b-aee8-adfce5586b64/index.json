  "question": "In context with the Turkish action against the Kurdish forces in Syria, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The Treaty of Lausanne provided for the establishment of Kurdistan.</li>\n<li>The Treaty of Sevres provided for establishment of Kurdistan.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Â Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Treaty of Lausanne did not provide for establishment of a Kurdistan. The Kurds of the region had long been demanding a separate and independent state for themselves. Turkey, however, negotiated with the Allied Power countries to prevent this in 1923 with the help of Treaty of Lausanne.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe idea of an independent Kurdistan had been proposed by Kurdish diplomat Mehmet Sherif Pasha. This proposed state had territories in Turkey, Iraq and Iran. The Treaty of Sevres (1920) allowed for setting it up, but in a much smaller form. However, the state failed to materialise because of the Treaty of Lausanne."
