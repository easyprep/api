  "question": "In context with the recently released reports by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority/ GBRMPA, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The report highlights climate change as the most significant threat to the GBR.</li>\n<li>The GBR has only soft corals but no hard corals.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe report from GBRMPA, called the Outlook Report, 2019 listed climate change as the most significant threat to the GBR. This report is released once every 5 years. The four major threats listed by the 2019 report are the same as those highlighted by the 2014 report. They are some types of fishing, coastal development and run-offs apart from climate change.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe GBR has both hard corals and soft corals. Hard corals are also known as reef building corals. They produce a hard skeleton made up of calcium carbonate unlike the soft corals. They are important for creation of structures like the GBR."
