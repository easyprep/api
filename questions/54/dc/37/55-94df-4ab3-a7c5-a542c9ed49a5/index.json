  "question": "Consider the following statements about Magnetic Water Treatment: <ol> <li>The magnetic treatment of water reduces the hardness of the incoming water supply&nbsp;</li> <li>Plants treated with magnetic water have more water holding capacity than those treated with normal water</li> <li>Magnetic treatment of water increases the surface tension of water which facilitates faster movement of nutrients and water within soil</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "3 Only",
  "option3": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Magnetic treatment of water decreases the surface tension of water which facilitates faster movement of nutrients and water within soil. Plants treated with magnetic water have more height than those treated with normal water. It also reduces the hardness of water.&nbsp;"
