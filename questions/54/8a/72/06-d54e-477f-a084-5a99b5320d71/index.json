  "question": "Consider the following statements:<br> 1. Fundamental Rights are basic, sacrosanct and permanent features of the constitution of India<br> 2. Fundamental rights are available only against the arbitrary action of state and not private individuals<br> Which among the above is / are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "Most of them are available against the arbitrary action of the State, with a few exceptions like those against the State's action and against the action of private individuals. When the rights that are available against the State's action only are violated by the private individuals, there are no constitutional remedies but only ordinary legal remedies. They are not sacrosanct or permanent. The Parliament can curtail or repeal them but only by a constitutional amendment act and not by an ordinary act. Moreover, this can be done without affecting the 'basic structure' of the Constitution. (M Laxmikanth)"
