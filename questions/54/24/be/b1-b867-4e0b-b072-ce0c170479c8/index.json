  "option1": 1264,
  "option2": 1690,
  "option3": 364,
  "option4": 70,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 364,
  "explanation": "Given that :\r\nLCM of two numbers = 1820\r\nHCF of those numbers = 26\r\nand one of the number is 130, hence another number is : <br/>$latex \\\\frac{1820\\\\times26}{130}=364&s=1$\r\nHence option [C] is the right answer."
