  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Sea of Azov is located to the north of the Crimean Peninsula. The southern coast is along the Black Sea. The Crimean Peninsula is surrounded by water on all sides and is connected to the European continent only through a small isthmus.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Isthmus of Perekop connects Crimea with Ukraine. It is the only feature that keeps Crimea from being considered an island. Crimea was annexed by Russia in 2014. Its Kerch Peninsula is separated from Russia by the Kerch Strait."
