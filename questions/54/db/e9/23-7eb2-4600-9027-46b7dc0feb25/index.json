  "question": "A train of length 500 feet crosses a platform of length 700 feet in 10 seconds. The speed of the train is :",
  "option1": "70 ft/sec",
  "option2": "85 ft/sec",
  "option3": "100 ft/sec",
  "option4": "120 ft/sec",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "120 ft/sec",
  "explanation": "$latex Speed\\\\ of\\\\ train\\\\ = \\\\frac{Length\\\\ of\\\\ (train+platform)}{Time\\\\ taken\\\\ to\\\\ cross}&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{500+700}{10} \\\\right ) = 120\\\\ feet/ sec.&s=1$\r\nHence option [D] is correct answer."
