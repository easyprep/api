  "option3": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "None",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 & 3 Only",
  "explanation": "“Right to Vote” is not a Fundamental Right but a Statutory Right or Legal Right. In India, the right to vote is provided by the Constitution under Article 326 and the Representation of People's Act, 1951, which provides voting rights to every citizen above the age of 18. Recently, a five-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court, in a writ petition filed by Common Cause, unanimously (albeit with four separate concurring judgments) held that the right to die with dignity is a component of the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution. Right to worship is a fundamental right as per Article 25 and Article 26 of the constitution. While Article 25 guarantees to every person the freedom of conscience and the free profession, practise and propagation of religion, Article 26 guarantees to every religious denomination, or a section of it, a right to manage its own affairs in matters of religion and the right to establish and maintain institutions for religious worship."
