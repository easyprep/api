  "question": "With reference to the recent discussions about the ‘green credit scheme’, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It allows forests to be traded as commodities.</li>\r\n<li>In current system, the industries are required to compensate for lost forests by finding another equivalent forested land.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe green credit scheme, which was recently approved by the Forest Advisory Committee, allows forests to be traded as a commodity. This helps the forest department to outsource its reforesting responsibilities to private agencies and village communities. It will also help the industries looking for compensatory land.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nIn the current system, the industries are required to compensate for lost forests (through their projects) with equivalent non- forested lands. These lands are then reforested by the forest department with the payment received from the industries, called Net Present Value."
