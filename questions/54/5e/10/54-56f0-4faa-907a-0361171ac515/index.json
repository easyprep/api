  "question": "In context with the recent dispute between India and Nepal over the Kalapani territory, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The demarcation of the territory was by the Simla Convention.</li>\n<li>River Kali forms the border between the two countries.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong> Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe demarcation of this region was in 1816 by the Treaty of Sugauli. This separated Nepal from the British India. The treaty was signed between the King of Nepal and the British east India Company. The treaty is a result of the Anglo- Nepalese War.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nAccording to the treaty, the western border of Nepal with India is marked by the River Kali. This is the source of the current conflict over Kalapani territory. Nepal contends that the treaty is referring to the ‘main river’ and hence claims Kalapani while India claims a ridgeline to the east of Kalapani as the border."
