  "question": "The product of two number is 9375 and the quotient, when the larger one is divided by the smaller, is 15. The sum of the numbers is :",
  "option1": 380,
  "option2": 395,
  "option3": 400,
  "option4": 425,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 400,
  "explanation": "Let the numbers be x and y and x is greater than y. \r\nAs given, xy = 9375 …….. (I)\r\nAgain, $latex \\\\frac{x}{y} = 15&s=1$\r\n$latex => x = 15y$\r\n∴ From equation (I), \r\n15y $latex \\\\times$ y = 9375\r\n$latex => y^{2} = \\\\frac{9375}{15} = 625&s=1$\r\n$latex => y = \\\\sqrt{625} = 25$\r\n∴ x = 15y = 15 $latex \\\\times$ 25 = 375\r\n∴ x + y = 375 + 25 = 400\r\nHence option [C] is right answer."
