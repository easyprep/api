Diwani Court was to decide both kind of cases.</li>\r\n<li>The lowest court was ‘Munsif ki Adalat’, in which cases pertaining to matter of value llpto 50 Rupees could be heard. Munsif was an Indian.</li>\r\n<li>Registrar was above Munsif who could hear the case involving value of maximum 200 Rupees.</li>\r\n<li>District Court was above Registrar, in which English judges were assisted by learned Hindus and Muslims.</li>\r\n<li>Four provincial courts were set up at Calcutta, Dhaka, Murshidabad and Patna. Here too the English judges were helped by the Indian advisers.</li>\r\n<li>Highest court was Sadar-Diwani Adalat, where Governor-General and his council delivered justice.</li>\r\n<li>The final appeal could be made in the office of English King and his council.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<strong>Criminal Court</strong>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>District Criminal Courts were set up, which were mobile and whose judges were English</li>\r\n<li>Four provincial criminal courts were set up at Murshidabad, Calcutta, Dhaka and Patna.</li>\r\n<li>Highest court of appeal, in criminal cases, was Sadar Nizamat, which was headed by Governor General and his Council.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<strong>Other Features of Cornwallis Code</strong>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The Diwani cases of Hindus were governed through their Shastras, especially based on Manu Smriti. The Muslims, on the other hand, were governed through Islamic Shariat.</li>\r\n<li>The criminal court was primarily based on Islamic Shariat with some changes, applicable to all, Hindus or Muslims.</li>\r\n<li>Witness rule was changed, earlier a Muslim witness was treated to be more reliable than a non-Muslim.</li>\r\n<li>Physical amputation was given up, instead, rigorous imprisonment was introduced.</li>\r\n<li>Company’s employees, including collectors, were brought under the law. They could be tried in the court of law. Thus slowly, India moved towards ‘rule of law’ and ‘equality before law’.</li>\r\n</ol>"
