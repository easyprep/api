  "question": "Which two countries are covered by the ecoregion \"Orinoco Delta swamp forests\"?",
  "option1": "Guyana and Venezuela",
  "option2": "Chile and Argentina",
  "option3": "Brazil and Paraguay",
  "option4": "Venezuela and Colombia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Guyana and Venezuela",
  "explanation": "Guyana and Venezuela are the two countries that are covered by the ecoregion \"Orinoco Delta swamp forests\". The Orinoco Delta swamp forests is an ecoregion of eastern Venezuela and northern Guyana covering the large and shifting Orinoco Delta. The vegetation is mostly permanently flooded rainforest. The ecoregion is relatively intact apart from a large area that was damaged by a failed flood control program in the 1960s. It is inaccessible, so logging is difficult, and the soil is unsuitable for farming. The main threat comes from oil exploration, which would bring an influx of settlers into the delta.",
