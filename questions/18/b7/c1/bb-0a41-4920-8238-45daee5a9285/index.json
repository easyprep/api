  "option1": "Delhi",
  "option2": "Pune",
  "option3": "Kolkata",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Pune",
  "explanation": "After the approval of the Supreme Court and the Bombay High Court, a pilot project for e-payments service will be started at  the Pune District Court complex in Shivajinagar on December 15 to bring transparency to cash transactions.  The facility will be available into the nazar (clerical) offices in the court, and civil lawyers & litigants can pay court fees, various fines, penalties, judicial deposits, rent, maintenance, etc. The e-payment facility will be available on ‘pay.ecourt.gov.in/epay’ and will help end the serpentine queues on court premises to pay cash. Hence, this will be the first time such a facility is being started anywhere in the country. There will be no extra charge for payments up to Rs 2,000, while the Pune district court administration is also working to facilitate payments above Rs 2,000 at nil or minimal cost through PoS or online services."
