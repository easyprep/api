The book was released by Dilip Vengsarkar, Manjrekarâ€™s first international captain. He has played 37 Test matches. His first Test match was in the Delhi against the West Indies. In 1996, in his early thirties, he finished his career with an average of 37, with four centuries, in Ahmedabad in 1996. He was clear to accept that after the middle-order pressure increased between Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly, they came out of their self-imposed exits."
