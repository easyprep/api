  "option1": 0.075,
  "option2": 0.073,
  "option3": 0.074,
  "option4": 0.076,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 0.074,
  "explanation": "As per latest report \\\"Global Economic Outlook\\\", Fitch Ratings has raised India\\'s growth forecast for 2018-19 to 7.4% from 7.3%, but cited higher financing costs and rising oil prices as risks to growth. It also said that the rupee has been among the worst performers vis-a-vis Asian currencies this year. For FY20, it estimated the country to grow at 7.5%. However, higher financing costs (stemming from monetary tightening and higher market premiums) and rising oil prices should limit the upside to growth."
