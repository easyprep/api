  "option5": "",
  "answer": "ASTROSAT",
  "explanation": "India’s first dedicated space observatory ASTROSAT has captured the rare phenomenon of a small, 6-billion-year-old “vampire” star “preying” on a bigger celestial body.The vampire star phenomenon is observed when smaller star sucks material (mass and energy) out of the bigger companion star, causing its eventual death. It is also called a blue straggler as small star becomes bigger, hotter and bluer, giving it the appearance of being young, while the ageing companion burns out and collapses to a stellar remnant. &nbsp;"
