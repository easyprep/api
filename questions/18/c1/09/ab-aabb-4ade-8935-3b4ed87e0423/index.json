  "question": "If the length of the diagonal AC of a square ABCD is 5.2 cm, then the area of the square is :",
  "option1": "10.00 sq.cm",
  "option2": "12.62 sq.cm",
  "option3": "13.52 sq.cm",
  "option4": "15.12 sq.cm",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "13.52 sq.cm",
  "explanation": "Side of square = $latex \\\\frac{Diagonal}{\\\\sqrt{2}}&s=1$\r\nâˆ´ Area = $latex \\\\frac{Diagonal^{2}}{2}&s=1$\r\n$latex =\\\\frac{\\\\left ( 5.2 \\\\right )^{2}}{2}&s=2$ $latex = \\\\frac{27.04}{2}&s=1$\r\n= 13.52 sq.cm\r\nHence option [C] is the right answer."
