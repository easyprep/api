This was used after the Bangladesh famine to improve credit availability to the rural poor. The concept had won him the Nobel Peace Prize. These banks lend credit to the poor without the requirement of collaterals.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe banks make use of ‘solidarity lending’.
