They \"introduced measures that remain in effect for professional boxing to this day, such as outlawing butting, gouging, scratching, kicking, hitting a man while down, holding the ropes, and using resin, stones or hard objects in the hands, and biting.\"They were later superseded by the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, the origins of the modern sport of boxing."
