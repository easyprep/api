  "answer": 0.05,
  "explanation": "Total discount = (920 - 742.90) = 177.10 Rs. \r\nFirst discount = 15%\r\nâˆ´ Discount = 15% of 920\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{920\\\\times 15}{100} = 138\\\\ Rs.&s=1$\r\nPrice after this discount = 920 - 138 = 782 Rs.\r\nRemaining Discount = 177.10 - 138 = 39.10 Rs. \r\nLet the second discount be x %. \r\n$latex \\\\therefore \\\\frac{782\\\\times x}{100} = 39.10&s=1$\r\n$latex => x = \\\\frac{39.10\\\\times 100}{782} = 5\\\\%&s=1$\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer"
