  "question": "Who among the following described the welfare state as a kind of enslavement?",
  "option1": "Karl Popper",
  "option2": "F.A. Hayek",
  "option3": "R. Nozick",
  "option4": "Milton Friedman",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "R. Nozick",
  "explanation": "Robert Nozick described the welfare state as a kind of enslavement. In Nozickâ€™s view, it is the surprising and radical conclusion that taxation, of the redistributive sort in which modern states engage in order to fund the various programmes of the bureaucratic welfare state, is morally illegitimate. It amounts to be a kind of forced labour."
