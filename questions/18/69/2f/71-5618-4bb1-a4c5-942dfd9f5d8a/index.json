Palaniswami and Chief Justice of Madras High Court, Indira Banerjee. It is an advocate/litigant-centric initiative which enables advocates and litigants to pay court fee online. Tamil Nadu State Government has launched this facility through their central record keeping agency - Stock Holding Corporation of India Ltd. It will be initially provided for the principal bench and Madurai bench of the high court. The e-stamps would not just do away with the hassle of procuring physical court fee stamps but will also help to tackle counterfeiting. So far, only Supreme Court and the High Courts in Delhi, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh have the e-court fee payment facility.",
