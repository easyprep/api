  "question": "Consider the following statements about the Nyaya Mitra scheme: <ol> <li>Under the scheme, the government will appoint a judicial magistrate of first classas “Nyaya Mitra”</li> <li>The scheme will focus mainly on those cases that are pending for more than 10 years at district level</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "First statement is incorrect because under the scheme, government will appoint a retired judicial or executive officer (with legal experience) designated as the “Nyaya Mitra”. The project would be operated out of District Facilitation Centres, housed in CSCs. The Nyaya Mitra scheme is aimed at reducing pendency of cases across selected districts, with special focus on those pending for more than 10 years. Nyaya Mitra’s responsibilities would include among others assistance to litigants who are suffering due to delay in investigations or trial, by actively identifying such cases through the National Judicial Data Grid, providing legal advice and connecting litigants to DLSA, CSC Tele Law, other government agencies and civil society organisations. He/she shall also refer the marginalized applicants to Lok Adalats for dispute resolution and render assistance towards prison reforms within the district, in coordination with the district judiciary and other stakeholders."
