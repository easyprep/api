  "option1": "Nayib Bukele",
  "option2": "Mauricio Funes",
  "option3": "Antonio Saca",
  "option4": "Alfredo Cristiani",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Nayib Bukele",
  "explanation": "Conservative businessman Nayib Bukele has been sworn-in as the new President of El Salvador.  His presidency breaks three decades of bipartisanship between the conservative Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) and the outgoing Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN).  Hence, Bukele is the first candidate to win the presidency since the end of the Salvadoran Civil War who did not represent either of the major two parties."
