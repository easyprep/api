  "question": "The Union Government has launched a blockchain-enabled marketplace app for which of the following commodities?",
  "option1": "Sugarcane",
  "option2": "Coffee",
  "option3": "Tea",
  "option4": "Cotton",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Coffee",
  "explanation": "In New Delhi, the Ministry of commerce has launched  a blockchain-enabled marketplace app for coffee to help farmers integrate with markets so that they can realise fair prices for the commodity. The app is developed in coordination with Eka Software Solutions and is intended to bring in transparency in coffee trade and maintain the traceability of Indian coffee from bean to cup so as the consumer tastes real Indian coffee and the grower is paid fairly for his produce. The blockchain will also reduce the number of layers between coffee growers and buyers and help farmers double their income. India is the only country in the world where entire coffee is grown under shade, handpicked and sun dried. Indian coffee is highly valued in the world market and sold as premium coffees. The share of farmers in the final returns from coffee is very meagre."
