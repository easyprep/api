  "option1": "Meteoroid  -  Meteor  - Meteorite",
  "option2": "Meteorite  -  Meteoroid  -  Meteor",
  "option3": "Meteor  -  Meteorite  -  Meteoroid",
  "option4": "Meteoroid  -  Meteorite  - Meteor",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Meteoroid  -  Meteor  - Meteorite",
  "explanation": "A meteoroid is a small rocky or metallic body travelling through space. When such an object enters the Earth’s atmosphere, it heats up from atmospheric friction and produces a streak of light, both from the glowing object and the trail of glowing particles that it leaves in its wake. This phenomenon is called a meteor, or colloquially a “shooting star” or “falling star”. If a meteoroid, comet or asteroid or a piece thereof withstands ablation from its atmospheric entry and impacts with the ground, then it is called a meteorite. (Wikipedia)"
