  "answer": "Tube wells> Canals> Wells> Tanks",
  "explanation": "First option is the correct answer.<br> Since 1950-51, the government had given considerable importance to the development of command area under canals. In 1950-51, the Canal irrigated area was 8.3 million hectares and it currently stands at 17 million hectares. Despite that, the relative importance of Canals has come down from 40% in 1951 to 26% in 2010-11. On the other hand, the well and tube well accounted for 29% total irrigated area and now they share 64% of the total irrigated area.<br> Well Irrigation is common in alluvial plains of the country except the deserts of Rajasthan. Plains of UP, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka &amp; Tamil Nadu are the states which are more prominently under the well irrigation. Canals are second most important source of irrigation in India after wells and tube wells. The Canals are irrigating those lands which have large plains, fertile soils and perennial rivers. The plains of North India are mostly canal irrigated. Other parts are coastal low lands and some parts of Peninsular India. The states are: Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Haryana, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, West Bengal, Punjab Rajasthan, Bihar, Karnataka, Tamilnadu and UP."
