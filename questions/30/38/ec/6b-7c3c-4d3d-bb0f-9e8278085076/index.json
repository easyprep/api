  "option1": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 1, 2 & 4",
  "option3": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe national park is not the sole habitat of the Great One horned rhinoceros. Other places like Orang national park and Pobitora wildlife sanctuary also hold these animals. It is however home to the largest of its population- representing 2/3<sup>rd</sup> of the existing members. The park is a significant contributor in bringing the herbivore back from extinction. The animals were often poached for their horns.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nWorld Heritage Site title is bestowed by the UNESCO. The title is given in recognition of historic, scientific, cultural or other forms of significance of a site. The site was declared so in 1985. It has a very rich biodiversity. It is on the border of a major biodiversity hotspot in India- Eastern Himalayan Biodiversity Hotspot.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nIt has a very high density of tiger population- one of the highest in the world. It was declared as a tiger reserve in 2006. It has a rich population of herbivores to support the tigers. The site also holds the title of Important Bird Area- conferred by the Birdlife International for the conservation of avifaunal species. It once housed 7 species of vultures. However, only 3 species remain as the rest had perished due to feeding on poisoned carcasses.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is correct:\nThe national park witnesses annual flooding events. This is because it is close to the Brahmaputra river and tributaries. This occurs during the monsoon. The flooding leads to a dynamic landscape in the park. It leads to creation of small water bodies in the flood plains called beels. The flooding is also a concern to the wildlife- many die during the season. The authorities have setup highlands to help the animals escape the inundation.\n&nbsp;"
