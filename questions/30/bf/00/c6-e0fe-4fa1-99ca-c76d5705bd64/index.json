  "explanation": "NASA has recently unveiled the calendar for the \\\"Artemis\\\" program that will return astronauts to the Moon for the first time in half a century. It will also include 8 scheduled launches and a mini-station in lunar orbit by 2024. The original lunar missions were named for Apollo -- Artemis was his twin sister in Greek mythology, and the goddess of hunting, wilderness and the Moon. The acronym ‘ARTEMIS’ stands for ‘Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence, and Electrodynamics of the Moon\\'s Interaction with the Sun’. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine confirmed that Artemis 1 will be an uncrewed mission around the Moon planned for 2020. Next will come Artemis 2, which will orbit Earth’s satellite with a crew around 2022; followed finally by Artemis 3 that will put astronauts on lunar soil in 2024, including the first woman. All the three will be launched into space by the Boeing-led Space Launch System (SLS), the biggest rocket of all time."
