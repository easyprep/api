  "question": "Which of the following is correct about the first ionization enthalpy of alkaline earth metals?",
  "option1": "It is higher than corresponding Group 1 metals",
  "option2": "It is lower than corresponding Group 1 metals",
  "option3": "No fix pattern exist",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "It is higher than corresponding Group 1 metals",
  "explanation": "The first ionization enthalpy of these metals is higher than corresponding Group 1 metals due to the small size of these elements compared to the corresponding alkali metals. The second ionization enthalpy of these metals is lower than corresponding alkali metals."
