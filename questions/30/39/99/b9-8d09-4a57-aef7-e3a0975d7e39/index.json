  "question": "Kerch Strait, which is in news recently, connects the Sea of Azov from which of the following seas?",
  "option1": "Mediterranean Sea",
  "option2": "Caspian Sea",
  "option3": "Red Sea",
  "option4": "Black Sea",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Black Sea",
  "explanation": "The Kerch Strait is a strait that connects the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Its’ also a narrow sea passage that divides Crimea from mainland Russia. The strait is spanned by the recently completed 11.8 mile Kerch Bridge, connecting Crimea to Russia.  Recently, it is in news because  Russia’s coast guard opened fire on & seized  three Ukrainian ships after a tense standoff in the Black Sea near the Crimean Peninsula. Russia blamed Ukraine for provoking the incident, which sharply escalated tensions that have been growing between the two countries since Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Now, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko  implement martial law for 30 days over the incident. The imposition of martial law permits the Ukrainian government to impose a range of drastic measures, if deemed necessary, including placing a ban public gatherings, restricting media freedoms, limiting the movement of Ukrainian nationals as well as foreign nationals and suspending elections. Hence, the confrontation at sea has raised fears of a wider military escalation and the UN Security Council (UNSC) hold an emergency session to consider a response."
