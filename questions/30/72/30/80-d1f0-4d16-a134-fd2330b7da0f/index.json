  "question": "Which of the following is true about the effect of altitude on the value of acceleration due to gravity?",
  "option1": "The acceleration due to gravity decreases with height",
  "option2": "The acceleration due to gravity increases with height",
  "option3": "The acceleration due to gravity is not dependent on height",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "The acceleration due to gravity decreases with height",
  "explanation": "The acceleration due to gravity decreases with height. G<sub>0</sub>= g(1-2h/R) where h is the height above the surface of the earth."
