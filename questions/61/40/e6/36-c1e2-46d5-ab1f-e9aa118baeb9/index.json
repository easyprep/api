  "question": "In context with the role of small businesses highlighted by the International Labour Organisation report, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Small businesses provide half of the jobs in developing economies according to this report.</li>\n<li>The per-capita GDP is negatively related to the employment share of micro and small enterprises.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe ILO Small Matters report said that more than 2/3<sup>rd</sup> of employment in developing and under-developed countries is provided by small businesses. This has lead the ILO to recommend that the policy makers treat these units as vital and central parts of the economy.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe report has shown that there is a negative co-relation between the per-capita GDP of an economy and the employment share of micro and small enterprises. This implies that the lowest income level economies are almost completely dependent upon self-employment."
