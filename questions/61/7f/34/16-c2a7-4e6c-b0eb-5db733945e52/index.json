  "answer": "Both 1 and 2",
  "explanation": "Mercury is the smallest among planets and also closest to the sun.Due to the absence of the atmosphere, water and a large range of temperature, life is not possible here. It has no satellites.Venus is the planet closest to the earth and is also the brightest planet.As it rotates on its axis from east to west, to an observer on venus, the sun would appear to rise in the west and set in the east. Venus has an atmosphere consisting mainly of carbon dioxide and it exerts a pressure about 100 times that of the atmospheric pressure on the earth.Like Mercury it also has no satellites.<br />"
