  "question": "Optical fibre works on which of the following principles?",
  "option1": "total internal reflection",
  "option2": "refraction",
  "option3": "scattering",
  "option4": "interference",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "total internal reflection",
  "explanation": "Fiber optic cables work because of the principle of total internal reflection. Therefore, if lights hit the sides of the cable at an angle greater than the critical angle, it will be bounced back into the cable."
