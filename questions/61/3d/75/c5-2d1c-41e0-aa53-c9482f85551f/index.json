  "answer": "Germany",
  "explanation": "Germany houses the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Muskauer Park\". Muskauer Park / Park Muzakowski is an extensive landscape initially developed between 1815 and 1844 by Prince Hermann von Puckler-Muskau on the grounds of his estate and continued by his student, Eduard Petzold. Set harmoniously in the river valley of the Lusatian Neisse, the park’s integration into the local town and surrounding agricultural landscapes heralded a new approach to landscape design and contributed to the advancement of landscape architecture as a discipline. The extensive site includes the river Neisse, other water features, human-made and natural, bridges, buildings, forested areas, and paths. It is an example of a cultural landscape in which the site’s natural attributes have been harnessed with the utmost skill."
