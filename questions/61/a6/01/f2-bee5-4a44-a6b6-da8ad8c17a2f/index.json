  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Mukhyamantri Krishak Durghatna Kalyan Yojana was introduced by the Uttar Pradesh government to aid farmers’ dependants in the state in case of death or handicapping due to accidents on the field. The scheme will provide a financial assistance of 5 lakh INR to the family in such cases.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe farmers who already get benefits from central schemes like Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Bima Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana can also get benefits from this state scheme given the assistance received from these central schemes doesn’t exceed 5 lakh INR. In other cases, the financial assistance from the state scheme will be provided after appropriate adjustments."
