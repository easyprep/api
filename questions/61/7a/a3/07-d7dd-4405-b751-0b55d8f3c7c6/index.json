Born in Kumilla district in present day Bangladesh in 1940, Roy had started his career in Bengali films in the 60s and became indispensable to the film makers for his portrayal of comic characters retaining the very essence of Bengaliness. He was equally noticed along with big names such as Soumitra Chatterjee and Rabi Ghosh in films like \\'Basanta Bilap\\' and \\'Dhonni Meye\\'. Roy was cast by Satyajit Ray in a small role in children\\'s fantasy \\'Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne\\'. He had immortalised the character of Tenyda in the film \\'Charmurti\\' which became a major hit in the 1980s."
