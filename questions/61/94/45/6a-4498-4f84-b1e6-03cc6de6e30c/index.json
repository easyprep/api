  "answer": "Sir Frank Whittle",
  "explanation": "Dr. Hans von Ohain and Sir Frank Whittle are recognized as the co-inventors of the jet engine. Each was working separately and knew nothing of the others work. Although Whittle started first, von Ohain was first to design and develop a turbojet engine to power an aircraft.\n\nOf the many honors received by both, the most significant honor was probably \"The Charles Draper Prize\" in 1992 which was given to both Hans von Ohain and Sir Frank Whittle for their efforts and contributions to aviation and mankind. \"The Charles Draper Prize\" is recognized as the equivalent to the Nobel Prize in technology.",
