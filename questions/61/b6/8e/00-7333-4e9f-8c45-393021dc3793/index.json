  "answer": "HDFC ERGO",
  "explanation": "HDFC ERGO General Insurance Company has recently launched the \\'Mosquito Disease Protection Policy\\'. This new policy will cover an individual against common mosquito-borne diseases like Dengue Fever, Malaria, Chikungunya, Japanese Encephalitis, Kala-azar, Lymphatic Filariasis and Zika Virus. According to the report published by National Health Profile 2018, there has been an alarming rise in dengue cases in India, an increase of 300% between 2009-2017. These diseases also lead to hospitalization adding burden on expense or affecting the No Claim Bonus of any standard Health Insurance. Hence, keeping this in mind, HDFC ERGO launched this new policy which will cover hospitalisation expenses incurred during the treatment of any mosquito-borne disease. Alternatively, the policyholder may opt for a lump sum amount to be paid as a policy benefit on providing the proof of hospitalization. In addition, the policy will pay the beneficiary the sum insured in case of the policyholder\\'s death due to the disease. This cover is available for individuals between the age group of 91 days to 65 years. This policy also provides international cover to individuals and covers all the vector-borne diseases listed in the policy document."
