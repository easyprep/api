  "explanation": "Honeypots are used to trap attackers into thinking that they have penetrated a network, allowing time for defenders to analyze their threat parameters and generate appropriate threat indicators to block an impending attack. Honeypots are decoy systems providing hosts that have no authorized users other than the honeypot administrators, as they serve no business function. It is mainly used for cloud services.\r\nHoneypots collect data on threats and activity directed at them that is considered suspicious. They are most often deployed inside of a firewall for control purposes. Honeypots are variants of standard intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSs) but with a greater focus on information gathering and deception.\r\n<strong>Why in news recently? </strong>Cybercriminals attempted attacks on Mumbai cloud server honeypot more than 6,78,000 times in a month, second after Ohio which had more than 9,50,000. Over 5 million global attacks were attempted on the network of honeypots."
