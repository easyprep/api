  "question": "Consider the following statements about the Cold fusion: <ol> <li>It is a form of energy generated when hydrogen interacts with metals like nickel &amp; palladium.</li> <li>No radioactive materials are used in cold fusion.</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is correct</u>. Cold fusion describes a form of energy generated when hydrogen interacts with various metals like nickel and palladium. It is a field of condensed matter nuclear science CMNS. It is also called low-energy nuclear reactions LENR. <u>Second statement is correct</u>. No radioactive materials are used in cold fusion. LANR occurs as the tiny protons, neutrons and electrons of hydrogen interact, releasing energy slowly. It releases energy without the dangerous radiation associated with conventional nuclear reactions, and cold fusion makes no radioactive waste."
