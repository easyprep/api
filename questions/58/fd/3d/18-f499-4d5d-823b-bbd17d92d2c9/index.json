  "question": "The 74th Constitution Amendment Act, 1992: <ol> <li>mandates direct election&nbsp;for the post of mayor&nbsp;in local government</li> <li>provides reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in every municipality</li> <li>provides&nbsp;term&nbsp;of 5 years for the municipality&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "3 Only",
  "option3": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 & 3 Only",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because the 74<sup>th</sup> Amendment Act, 1992 did not prescribe the manner of election, tenure or powers of the Mayors/Chairpersons of ULBs. Recently, a Constitutional Amendment bill has been introduced in Lok Sabha, as a private member's bill by Shashi Tharoor. The Bill mandates the direct election of the Mayor, fixes the Mayor&rsquo;s term to be coterminous with that of the municipality, and makes the Mayor the executive head of the municipality. The Bill was introduced because recently Tamil Nadu Assembly passed a Bill for indirect election of mayors. The manner of election of Chairpersons of municipalities has been left to be specified by the&nbsp;State Legislature (Article 243R)."
