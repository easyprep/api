  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "We have studied that the &#039;Mega food Park scheme&#039; is based on hub and spoke architecture with &#039;collection centres&#039; as smallest Unit. So first statement is wrong. Second statement is also wrong because the central government neither provides land nor bears cost of the land. Land cost is borne by the Special purpose Vehicle responsible for each MFP. Third statement is correct."
