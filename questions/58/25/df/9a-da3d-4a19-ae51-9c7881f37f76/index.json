  "answer": "people are willing but not get work",
  "explanation": "Open unemployment is a condition in which people have no work to do. They are able to work and are also willing to work but there is no work for them. They are found partly in villages, but very largely in cities. Most of them come from villages in search of jobs, many originate in cities themselves. Such employment can be seen and counted in terms of the number of such persons. Hence it is called open unemployment."
