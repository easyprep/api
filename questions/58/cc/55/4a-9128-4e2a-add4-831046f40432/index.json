  "answer": "Pakistan",
  "explanation": "Ehsan Mania, the current Chairman of Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), has been appointed chief of the ICC’s influential  Finance & Commercial Affairs (F&CA).  The move may not be music to Indian board’s (BCCI) ears. The fear within the Indian cricket circles is that it could pit India against Pakistan in the corridors of the game’s administration in the near future.  F&CA  is one of the ICC’s most important committees & is responsible for designing budgets for ICC events and distributing money to its member countries."
