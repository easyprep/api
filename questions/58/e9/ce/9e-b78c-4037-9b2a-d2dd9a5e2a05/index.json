  "question": "In recent times, the concept of &#8220;plug-and-play&#8221; projects was making news. Consider the following statements with this respect:<br> 1. All statutory clearances will be obtained by government before awarding the project<br> 2. Plug and Play model ensures that infrastructure projects don&#8217;t get delayed<br> Which among the above is / are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "In a bid to ensure that infrastructure projects don&#8217;t get stalled and later turn up as non-performing assets, a concept of plug-and-play projects has been conceived where only implementation-ready projects having all clearances in place would be allocated through a transparent auction process in the way coal blocks are being given out."
