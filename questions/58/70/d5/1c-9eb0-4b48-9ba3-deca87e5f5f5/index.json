  "question": "In which of the following plants, gametophyte is considered prothallus?",
  "option1": "Bryophyte",
  "option2": "Thallophyta",
  "option3": "Spermatophyte",
  "option4": "Pteridophyta",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Pteridophyta",
  "explanation": "Gametophyte is considered prothallus in Pteridophytes. Just as with seed plants and mosses, the life cycle of pteridophytes involves alternation of generations. This means that a diploid generation of the sporophyte, which produces spores is followed by a haploid generation i.e. the gametophyte or prothallus, which produces gametes."
