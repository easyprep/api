  "question": "Identify the Volleyball player's strategy. \"These players have the task for orchestrating the offence of the team. They aim for the second touch and their main responsibility is to place the ball in the air where the attackers can place the ball into the opponents' court for a point.\"?",
  "option1": "Setters",
  "option2": "Liberos",
  "option3": "Middle blockers",
  "option4": "Outside hitters",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Setters",
  "explanation": "Setters have the task of orchestrating the offence of the team. They aim for the second touch and their main responsibility is to place the ball in the air where the attackers can place the ball into the opponents' court for a point. They have to be able to operate with the hitters, manage the tempo of their side of the court and choose the right attackers to set. Setters need to have a swift and skilful appraisal and tactical accuracy and must be quick at moving around the court."
