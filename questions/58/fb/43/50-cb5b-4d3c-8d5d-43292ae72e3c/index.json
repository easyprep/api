  "question": "Motor-cyclist P started his journey at a speed of 30 km/hr. After 30 minutes, motor cyclist Q started from the same place but with a speed of 40 km/hr. How much time will Q take to overtake P?",
  "option1": "$latex 1\\ hours$",
  "option2": "$latex \\frac{3}{8}\\ hours&s=1$",
  "option3": "$latex \\frac{3}{2}\\ hours&s=1$",
  "option4": "$latex 2\\ hours$",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "$latex \\frac{3}{2}\\ hours&s=1$",
  "explanation": "Distance covered by motor cyclist P in 30 minutes. \r\n$latex = 30\\\\times \\\\frac{1}{2} = 15\\\\ km&s=1$\r\nRelative Speed = 40 - 30 = 10 km/hr\r\nâˆ´ Required Speed = Time taken to cover is km at 10 km/hr\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{15}{10} = \\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\ hours&s=1$\r\nHence option [C] is correct answer."
