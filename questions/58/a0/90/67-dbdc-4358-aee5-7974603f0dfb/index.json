  "option1": "Armenia",

  "option4": "Georgia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Georgia",
  "explanation": "Georgia's traditional intangible cultural heritage is \"Supra feast\". A supra is a traditional Georgian feast and a part of Georgian social culture. There are two types of supra: a festive supra called a keipi, and a sombre supra called a kelekhi, that is always held after burials. The traditions of supra, as an important part of Georgian social culture, were inscribed on the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Georgia list in 2017. Traditionally, and for many Georgians, up to the present, the foregrounded participants at a supra are men, with women relegated to secondary, supporting roles (especially as far as food preparation is concerned)."
