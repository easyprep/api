  "answer": "Timor-Leste and Australia",
  "explanation": "The CMATS Treaty, otherwise known as Treaty between Australia and the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea, provides for the equal distribution of revenue derived from the disputed Greater Sunrise oil and gas field between Australia and Timor-Leste. The field is located in the Timor Gap where Australia and Timor-Leste have overlapping claims over the continental shelf or seabed. CMATS also puts on hold the right by both countries to claim sovereign rights, discuss maritime boundaries or engage in any legal process in relation to maritime boundaries or territorial jurisdiction for 50 years which is the duration the treaty is in effect. CMATS is one of three treaties concerning the exploitation of gas and petroleum in the Timor Gap and is to be read together with the other two treaties, namely the Timor Sea Treaty of 2002 and the Sunrise International Unitization Agreement of 2003."
