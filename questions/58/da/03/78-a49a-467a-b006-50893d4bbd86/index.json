  "question": "The path of Halley’s Comet in its orbit around the sun is of what shape?",
  "option1": "Parabolic",
  "option2": "Hyperbolic",
  "option3": "Elliptical",
  "option4": "Circular",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Elliptical",
  "explanation": "Halley\\'s orbital period has varied between 74–79 years since 240 BC. Its orbit around the Sun is highly elliptical, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.967 (with 0 being a circle and 1 being a parabolic trajectory). The perihelion, the point in the comet\\'s orbit when it is nearest the Sun, is just 0.6 AU."
