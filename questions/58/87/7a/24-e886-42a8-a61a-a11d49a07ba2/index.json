  "answer": "Sebastian Pinera",
  "explanation": "Billionaire conservative Sebastian Pinera has won the 2017 presidential election of Chile on December 17, 2017. With 98.44% of the ballots counted, Pinera had won 54.57% in the run-off vote, to 45.43% for senator Guillier, a wider than expected margin in a race that pollsters had predicted would be tight. Pinera has pledged support and stable funding for Chile\\'s state-run miner Codelco , and has promised to slash red tape which had bogged down projects under Bachelet."
