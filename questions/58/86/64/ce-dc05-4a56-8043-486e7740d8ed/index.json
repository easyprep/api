  "question": "For the biomagnification of a particle to occur which of the following conditions should exist?",
  "option1": "Water soluble",
  "option2": "Short- lived",
  "option3": "Biologically active",
  "option4": "Immobile",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Biologically active",
  "explanation": "Biomagnification refers to the tendency of pollutant to concerntrate as they move from one trophic level to another. For biomagnification to take place a particle should be biologically active and mobile so that it can move to the higher level, it should be long-lived and soluble in fat.<strong><br /></strong>"
