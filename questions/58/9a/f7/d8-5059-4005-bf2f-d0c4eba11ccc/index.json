  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Trade Wind Deserts or Tropical Western Deserts are located on the western margins or the continents in the trade wind belt, between roughly 20° and 30° N and S latitudes. Trade winds are the prevailing winds and these easterly winds become dry by the time they reach the western margins of the continents. This is the reason why these areas are deserts. These regions also come under the influence of the sub-tropical belts of high pressure characterized by air subsidence; working as an important factor of the aridity of these regions. Examples:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Desert region in the northwestern part of India and the adjoining part of Pakistan (Thar Desert)</li>\r\n<li>Deserts of Arabia and Syria in southwest Asia</li>\r\n<li>Sahara in northern Africa</li>\r\n<li>Deserts of Colorado and Arizona in North America</li>\r\n<li>Great Australian Desert</li>\r\n<li>Kalahari Desert in South Africa</li>\r\n<li>Atacama Desert in South America</li>\r\n</ul>"
