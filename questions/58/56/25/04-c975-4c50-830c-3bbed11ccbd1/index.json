Distribution of smartphones will start during the 'Vikas Yatra' campaign of Chief Minister Raman Singh. The Yatra has been organised to create awareness about developmental activities undertaken by the incumbent BJP Government under Mr. Raman Singh. Distribution of smartphones would be taken up in two phases - 30 lakh in first phase and remaining in the second phase. Women heads of households will be the priority recipients of the smartphones as out of 50 lakh smartphones, 40 lakh will be given to women heads of households in villages having population of more than 1000, 5 lakh phones will be given to women heads belonging to poor families living in urban areas and 5 lakh phones will be given to college students. Proving smartphones will facilitate reach of citizen-centric services to the people in remote area through 11000 common service centres (CSCs) of Chhattisgarh Infotech Promotion Society (CHiPS), will apprise people of government's welfare schemes and will also help in cashless payments through digital transactions.",
