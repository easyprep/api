  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 2, & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Differentiated licensing is in contrast to universal banking. While under universal banking the existing PSBs and private sector banks can provide all banking services, under differentiated banking services, the Small Finance Banks and Payment Banks can provide only limited products. Also while the Payment Banks and Small Finance Banks require having a minimum capital of Rs 100 crores, universal banks should have a capital of Rs 500 crore. Differentiated bank license policy refers to the new guidelines by the RBI inviting individuals/entities to start banks in the form of either small finance banks or payment banks. <u>WLTF is the third category of a differentiated bank licence.</u> The RBI has already issued differentiated licences for payments banks and small finance banks."
