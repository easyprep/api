  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct because the core principle of the 1951 Refugee Convention is non-refoulement, which asserts that a refugee should not be returned or repatriated to a country where they face serious threats to their life or freedom. Second statement is incorrect because India is not a signatory to the convention."
