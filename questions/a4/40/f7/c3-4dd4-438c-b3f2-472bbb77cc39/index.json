  "question": "Delhi has flagged off its Terminator Train. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is to reduce mosquito breeding along the railway lines.</li>\n<li>Fourth generation pesticides, recommended by the Central Insecticide Board, contains malathion.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:<strong>Â </strong>",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Terminator Train is used by the Delhi municipality to curb mosquitoes along the railway tracks. These areas see stagnant waters, especially during monsoons, which is a favourable condition for mosquito breeding. The train will carry a power spray that will disperse the insecticide along the track and its vicinity.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Central Insecticide Board had recommended the government authorities to shift to 4<sup>th</sup> generation pesticides to control mosquitoes. This is because the insects have evolved resistance towards DDT and malathion that are used commonly. The 4<sup>th</sup> generation mix contains pirimiphos-methyl and diflubenzuron.\n&nbsp;"
