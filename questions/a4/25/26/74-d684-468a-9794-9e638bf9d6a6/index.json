  "question": "Consider the following statements about the “Hong Kong International Convention” that was in news recently: <ol> <li>India has recently ratified the convention</li> <li>The convention is related to Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Biological Weapons</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 nor 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u>. India has not ratified the convention as of now. However, the Indian government has drafted legislation to ratify the IMO’s Hong Kong Convention on safe ship-recycling. Only 6 countries have ratified the treaty, Turkey being the sixth country. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u> because the convention is for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ship. The Convention has still not entered into force. The following are the prerequisites for the convention to enter into force: <ul> <li>ratification by 15 states;</li> <li>representation by 40 per cent of world merchant shipping (by gross tonnage); and</li> <li>a combined maximum annual ship recycling volume not less than 3 per cent of the combined tonnage of the ratifying states</li> </ul>"
