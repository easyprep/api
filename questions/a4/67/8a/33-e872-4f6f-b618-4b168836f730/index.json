  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "None of them",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "In India, the scheduled areas can be declared by President by order. This means that just to declare a scheduled area, there is no need of any legislation. The President at any time can order that the whole or part of a schedule area ceases to be a scheduled area. Thus, the President of India has the power to declare an area as scheduled area and also the power to declare a scheduled area to be ceased to be known as scheduled area.<br />The power to alter the boundaries of the Scheduled President can also by order alter the boundaries of the scheduled areas. However, to change the boundary of a scheduled area, the president is required to consult the Governor of the state in which the area is located."
