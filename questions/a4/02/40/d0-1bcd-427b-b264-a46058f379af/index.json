  "answer": "2 only",
  "explanation": "Statement 1 is incorrect: The Asian Highway network is a regional transport cooperation initiative aimed at enhancing the efficiency and development of the road infrastructure in Asia, supporting the development of Euro-Asia transport linkages and improving connectivity for landlocked countries. The Asian Highway project was initiated in 1959 with the aim of promoting the development of an international road transport system in the region. From 1960 to 1970, potential routes were identified and analysed. However, the progress was slow until political and economic changes in the region spurred renewed interest in the network in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Statement 3 is incorrect: India signed the Inter-Governmental Agreement on Asian Highway Network during the 60th Annual Session of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific (UNESCAP), held in April, 2004. The Asian Highways (AH) 1 and AH 2 passes through the North-Eastern States of India following the National Highway stretches from the Indo-Myanmar border at Moreh in the State of Manipur via Imphal-Kohima (Nagaland)-Dimapur-Nagaon-Jorabat (Assam)-Shillong-Dawki- Tamabil up to Indo-Bangladesh border in the State of Meghalaya having a length of about 740 km."
