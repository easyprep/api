  "answer": "Dalbir Singh",
  "explanation": "General (Retd.) Dalbir Singh Suhag has been appointed as India\\'s new high commissioner to the Republic of Seychelles. He is expected to take up the assignment shortly. His appointment comes amid deepening military ties between India and the island nation.  Incidentally, Suhag was the chief of army staff when India conducted surgical raids across the Line of Control into Pakistan-administered Kashmir in 2016 after the terrorist attack on an Indian army camp in Uri. Seychelles is strategically important to India as New Delhi is developing Assumption Island as a naval base to expand its footprint in the strategically-key region where China has been trying to enhance its military presence."
