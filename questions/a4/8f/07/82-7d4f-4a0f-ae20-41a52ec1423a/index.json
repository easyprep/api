  "answer": "Spain",
  "explanation": "In the early 16th century, the Spanish Empire conquered the territory of El Salvador, incorporating it into the Viceroyalty of New Spain ruled from Mexico City. However, the Viceroyalty of Mexico had little to no influence in the daily affairs of the Central American isthmus including El Salvador, which would be colonized in 1524. In 1609 the area became the Captaincy General of Guatemala, of which El Salvador was part until its independence from Spain, which took place in 1821, as part of the First Mexican Empire."
