  "question": "The National Company Law Tribunal/ NCLT is to set up an Amaravati bench in Andhra Pradesh. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>NCLT benches can be chaired only by retired High Court Judges.</li>\n<li>NCLT is a quasi-judicial body.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nNCLT benches are chaired by either a retired or serving High Court Judge. These benches deal with cases that fall under the purview of Companies Act, 2013. After 2014 bifurcation of the united Andhra Pradesh, the Hyderabad bench was serving both the states. Now the new bench will serve AP exclusively.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe NCLT was established in 2016 as a quasi-judicial body. Quasi-judicial bodies are involved in interpretation of law. Such bodies usually have a specific area of expertise or authority. National Human Rights Commission is another example of a quasi-judicial body."
