  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nTurkey is located to the north of Syria. They are located in the West Asian region. Syria is bordered by Iraq in the east, Jordan in the south, Israel in the south-west and Cyprus Island off-shore in the west. The military action of Turkey against Syria has been criticised by India.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Arab nation does not have its border along the Red Sea. Its western coast is along the Mediterranean Sea. The country is considered as one of the states that form the ‘cradle of civilisation’. The seafloor between Cyprus and Syria is rich in oil deposits."
