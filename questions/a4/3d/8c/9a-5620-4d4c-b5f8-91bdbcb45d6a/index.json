  "question": "Why do you feel chill after having a dip in sea water?",
  "option1": "The difference in temperature between sea water and the atmosphere",
  "option2": "Evaporation of water from the body",
  "option3": "Deposition of salt on the body",
  "option4": "None of these",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Evaporation of water from the body",
  "explanation": "The sea water first makes us feel cool because of its cool temperature, then after sometime it makes our body chill due to the process of evaporation. But sweat will only evaporate in an environment where there isn\\'t much water in the air. In a place with high humidity, there\\'re already lots of water molecules in the air."
