  "question": "What is the rate of acceleration produced by 1 dyne force acting on a body of mass 1 gram?",
  "option1": "9.8 m s<sup>-2</sup>",
  "option2": "1 m s<sup>-2</sup>",
  "option3": "1 cm s<sup>-2</sup>",
  "option4": "9.8 cm s<sup>-2</sup>",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 cm s<sup>-2</sup>",
  "explanation": "One dyne force is that much force which produces an acceleration of 1 cm s<sup>-2</sup> in a body of mass one gram. 1 dyne = 1 g cm s<sup>-2</sup> Also, 1 N = 10<sup>5</sup> dyne"
