It is the national bird of Dominica. IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species classified this bird as a \"critically endangered species\", in terms of their conservation status. They are mostly seen in mountain forest areas of Morne Diablotins and Picard River valley forest of Dominica. A major cause for the population decline of this bird species has been hurricanes, habitat loss due to the human disturbance and illegal animal trading."
