  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Conservation Reserves can be declared by the State Governments in any area owned by the Government. The rights of people living inside a Conservation Reserve are not affected in conservation reserves.&nbsp;The Wildlife Protection Act defines five types of protected areas&nbsp;viz.&nbsp;National Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries, Community Reserves, Conservation Reserves and Tiger Reserves. These areas provide a&nbsp;greater role and opportunity for local communities, stakeholders and civil society&nbsp;to protect many areas of conservation value that cannot be designated under strict categories such as wildlife sanctuaries or national parks."
