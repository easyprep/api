  "question": "With reference to India being a Union of States, consider the following statements:<br> 1. Each state of Union of India is guaranteed a territorial integrity by the union<br> 2. The name of each state and union territory is mentioned in the constitution itself<br> 3. The union of India is a result of agreement among its constituent states and union territories<br> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "None of them",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "The first thing is that the Constitution of India does not <strong>guarantee the territorial integrity of any state of the Union</strong>. The parliament can even cut away the entire area of the state to form a new state. Thus statement 1 is incorrect. The second statement is correct as the names of states and union territories are entered into the first schedule. The third statement is incorrect. Indian Union is not a result of an agreement among its constituent states and UTs. This happened in US. Here, all princely states who acceded to Union once lost the right to secede from the Union for ever."
