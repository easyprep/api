  "answer": "Egypt",
  "explanation": "Al-Azhar Park is a public park located in Cairo, Egypt, which is listed as one of the world's sixty great public spaces by the Project for Public Spaces (PPS). The park was created by the Historic Cities Support Programme (HCSP) of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC), an entity of the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN). Al Azhar Park, located by the Old City of Cairo, offers a 30-hectare expanse of greenery on what was dust and rubble for over two centuries. Offering a contemporary design inspired by historic Islamic gardens, the nerve centre of the park forms a formal axis with a water channel leading in the direction of a small lake, with accompanying alleyways, and pointing towards the Citadel."
