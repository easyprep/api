  "question": "The Bombay Natural History Society is planning to release Himalayan Griffons into the wild. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is an endangered species.</li>\n<li>The bird population declined due to the drug Diclofenac.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nHimalayan Griffon or the Himalayan Vulture is a near threatened species according to IUCN. These birds along with others like White Backed Vulture, Long-billed Vulture and Slender-billed Vulture have been the subject of conservation efforts by BNHS backed Vulture Conservation and Breeding Centres.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe population had faced threats from the wide use of Diclofenac. It is a pain reliever that was used for cattle. When the vultures fed on the cattleâ€™s carcasses, they faced decline. However, the population decline was not as drastic as for other species of vultures. The veterinary use of diclofenac is banned.\n&nbsp;"
