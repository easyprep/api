  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "The archaeological remains at Mohenjo-daro extend around 300 hectares, and the site was considered as the biggest Harappan site till January 2014. But with the <u>discovery of two new mounds at Rakhigarhi site in January 2014</u>, the area of Rakhigarhi increased to 350 hectares, thus, making it the largest Indus Valley Site. <u>As per latest report published in April 2015</u>, based on C 14 radio-dating, it has been found that the mounds at Bhirrana village, situated on the banks of Ghaggar River, in Fatehabad district of Haryana date back to 7570-6200 BC, and the site has been declared as the oldest site of Indus Valley Civilization. The previous Pakistan-French study had put Mehrgarh site located near the Bolan Pass in Pakistan as the oldest site. Chanhudaro is the only site without any citadel. Archaeologists have also discovered shell-ornament makers and bead maker shops from this site."
