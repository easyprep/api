  "option2": "Phytosanitary Measures",
  "option3": "Technical Barriers to Trade",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Phytosanitary Measures",
  "explanation": "The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures &#8211; also known as the SPS Agreement is an international treaty of the World Trade Organization. It was negotiated during the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and entered into force with the establishment of the WTO at the beginning of 1995. Under the SPS agreement, the WTO sets constraints on member-states&#8217; policies relating to food safety (bacterial contaminants, pesticides, inspection and labeling) as well as animal and plant health (phytosanitation) with respect to imported pests and diseases. The SPS agreement is closely linked to the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which was signed in the same year and has similar goals."
