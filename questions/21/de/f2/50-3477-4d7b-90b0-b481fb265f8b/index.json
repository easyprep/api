  "answer": "3 only",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\n    Manipur is the first state to legislate on this matter. The Manipur anti-lynching legislation creates provisions like special courts, nodal officer for dealing with the issue. The law is closely based on the Supreme Court directive and was passed in 2018. The Rajasthan bill makes the western state the second in India to take measures against this issue. \n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe bill provides for strict punitive measures: life imprisonment and a fine of upto 5 lakh INR. The bill was passed after the agitations surrounding the Pehlu Khan case in Haryana. The bill defines attack by a collection of 2 or more people as a mob lynching.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nSimilar to the Manipur law, the Rajasthan bill also provides for appointment of a nodal officer for preventing such crimes. They are to be of Inspector General of Police level. The bill also provides for relief camps for victims in safe zones. It also provides for free of cost treatment and compensations for the victim."
