  "question": "In light of recent studies highlighting the sinking of deltas, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Ground water depletion contributes to delta sinking.</li>\n<li>Sediment starvation of delta leads to its sinking.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nRiver deltas sink naturally. However, anthropogenic reasons are also contributing to the rapid sinking of deltas. Ground water depletion has been determined as one of the leading causes of delta sinking. The Ganga delta is one example of sinking delta due to ground water depletion.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nSediment starvation is the reduction in rate of deposition of sediments at the delta by the river. This can be due to dams and restricted flow of rivers. This reduced sedimentation is also contributing to sinking of deltas."
