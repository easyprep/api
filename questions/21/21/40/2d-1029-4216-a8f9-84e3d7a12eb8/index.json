  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nKnesset is the term used to refer to Israel’s national legislature. The term Knesset is derived from Hebrew for ‘Great Assembly’. The body has been in news as even after 2 elections, a stable government is yet to be formed in Israel.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:   </strong>\nKnesset is unicameral unlike India. In unicameralism, only one house is present in the legislature. The Knesset has 120 seats. The Knesset is presided over by a Speaker and a post for the Deputy Speaker is also provided for."
