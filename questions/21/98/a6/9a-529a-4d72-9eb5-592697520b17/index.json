  "question": "In context of the recent plans of ISRO to construct the Thuthukudi spaceport, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It is to be constructed in Tamil Nadu</li>\r\n<li>It will enable ‘straight southwards’ launches.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nISRO is to set up a new spaceport (rocket launch site) in Thuthukudi district of Tamil Nadu. This is the second spaceport after the one in Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh. The site is located close to the eastern coast and smaller than the Sriharikota site.\r\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe Thuthukudi launch site will enable ‘straight southwards’ launch which isn’t possible from Sriharikota site. This will enable the rockets to carry heavier payloads into the space. The site will also aid in managing the increasing number of satellite launches by ISRO.\r\n&nbsp;"
