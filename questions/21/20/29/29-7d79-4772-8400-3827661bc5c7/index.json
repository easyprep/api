  "question": "In context with the recent Indo-German collaborative study on devulcanisation of rubber, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Devulcanisation is used to recycle rubber.</li>\n<li>A devulcanised rubber cannot be subject to vulcanisation again.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Â Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nDevulcanisation is the process by which rubber scraps are recycled. The study came up with a more efficient method of devulcanisation that would result in stronger end product. Devulcanisation involves the breaking of sulphur bonds. It can be used on scrap rubber tyres and other waste rubbers.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe technique developed by the team enables the recycled rubber to be vulcanised again. It uses a process called chain capping reaction during devulcanisation and is achieved with the help of an agent called TESPT. The recycled rubber is blended with fresh rubber before being vulcanised again."
