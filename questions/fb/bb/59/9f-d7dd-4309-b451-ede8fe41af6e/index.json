  "question": "What is the height of geo-stationary satellites from the surface of the earth?",
  "option1": "30000 km",
  "option2": "36000 km",
  "option3": "48000 km",
  "option4": "72000 km",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "36000 km",
  "explanation": "The satellite which appears stationary relative to earth is called a geostationary satellite. A geostationary satellite always stays over the same place above the earth. Such a satellite appears stationary due to its zero relative velocity w.r.t. that place on earth. The height of geo-stationary satellites from the surface of the earth is 36000 km."
