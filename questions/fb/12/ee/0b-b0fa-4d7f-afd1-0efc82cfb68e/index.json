  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nIndia had become a member of the SCO in 2017. India did not attend the recent meeting that was held in China’s Xi’an. This is because of India’s stand against the Belt and Road Initiative/ BRI project of China especially because of concerns regarding India’s sovereignty in the region.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nIndia is not one of the Shanghai Five. The group was responsible for the establishment of SCO in 2001. It consists of China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. This was after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Uzbekistan joined SCO in 2001. Pakistan joined SCO in 2017."
