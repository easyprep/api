  "question": "Two pieces of ice at 0°C would freeze together if pressed against each other and then released. In this context, which among the following is the correct principle in action in this?",
  "option1": "The melting point of pure ice decreases with pressure.",
  "option2": "The melting point of pure ice increases with Pressure",
  "option3": "The melting point of pure ice first increases, then decreases with pressure",
  "option4": "The melting point of pure ice first decreases then increases with pressure",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "The melting point of pure ice decreases with pressure.",
  "explanation": "Melting point of pure ice decreases with pressure at the rate of 0.0072°C per atmosphere and this is called regulation, which was discovered by Faraday and occurs at some 0°C or very slightly less temperature."
