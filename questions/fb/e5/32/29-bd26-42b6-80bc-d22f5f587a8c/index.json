  "question": "The excessive use of fertilizers has led to degradation of soil fertility. Consider the following statements in this context: <ol> <li>The average organic matter in Indian soils is in range of 1-1.5%, which is too low</li> <li>Organic farming helps in maintaining the fertility of soil fertility.</li> </ol> Which of the above is / are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "<strong>The excessive use of fertilizers has led to degradation of soil fertility. How to tackle the problem of soil fertility?</strong> &nbsp; One of the major fallout of excessive use of fertilizer is the loss of soil fertility. Generally the content of soil organic matter is 0.3% in the country; should be in the range of 1-1.5%. However, in case of Indian soil the content of organic matter is merely 0.3 %, which is quite low. <strong>How the soil fertility can be improved </strong> Soil Health card, which provides information on acidic levels, micronutrients and organic content of the soil, so that farmers can understand their soil and grow crop accordingly. Less water-intensive crops are another measure to maintain and improve the fertility of the soil. Another solution to the issue of soil fertility is to grow biomass on the farm utilizing the available moisture and return this organic content back to the soil.  Crop diversification is another solution for crop fertility. Instead of monoculture crops every year, crop rotation will help in the restoration of fertility. Apart from that Agroforestry will help in building humus substances that enrich the soil with micronutrients. Organic farming helps in maintaining the fertility of soil fertility. There is a direct co-relation in healthy soils and healthy food. Poisoned soils produce foods which will cause various health problems. India have just 2% of world's geographical area and 17% of the world's population so maintaining soil fertility is very crucial in order to ensure food security."
