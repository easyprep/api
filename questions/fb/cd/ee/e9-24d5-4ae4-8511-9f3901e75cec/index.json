  "explanation": "Caffeine can increase blood pressure and cause vasoconstriction. Doses of caffeine equivalent to the amount normally found in standard servings of tea, coffee and carbonated soft drinks appear to have no diuretic action.<br />Citric acid is a natural preservative and is also used to add an acidic (sour) taste to foods and soft drinks. In biochemistry, it is important as an intermediate in the citric acid cycle and therefore occurs in the metabolism of almost all living things.<br />All vitamins are best for strong bones and teeth. But, vitamin C is especially best for the formation of bones and teeth. Vitamin C, also called ascorbic acid, is important to many functions in the body. For example, it is needed to grow and repair tissues throughout the body.<br />Ascorbic acid acts as a preservative and prevents the browning of fruits.
