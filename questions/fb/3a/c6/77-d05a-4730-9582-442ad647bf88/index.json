  "question": "Madhya Pradesh is set to invoke the National Security Act against milk adulterators in the state. Consider the following statements about the act:\n<ol>\n<li>NSA allows preventive detention for a period of 6 months both by the centre and state governments</li>\n<li>Enacted in 1980, this is the first preventive detention law in India.</li>\n<li>NCRB records show that 14 lakh people are held under preventive laws.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "None of the above",
  "option3": "All of the above",
  "option4": "1 and 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Â Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nNSA allows the centre and state governments to hold a person for a period of 12 months. This is the maximum period for holding without charges. In presence of fresh evidence, the person can be held for longer. A person can be held for 10 days without informing the charges, under the NSA.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe 1980 law is not the first of its kind. In colonial era, 1818 Bengal Regulation III acted as a preventive detention law. 1919 Rowlatt act provided for imprisonment without trial. After independence, 1950 Preventive Detention Act and 1971 Maintenance of Internal Security Act are precursors of the NSA\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe NSA provides for detention without filing an FIR. NCRB/ National Crime Records Bureau has data only about those cases with FIR. Information of NSA arrests is available from the 2001 law commission report- which says that 14 lakh people are imprisoned under preventive laws in India.\n&nbsp;"
