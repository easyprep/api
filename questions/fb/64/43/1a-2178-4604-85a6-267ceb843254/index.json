  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Adam Smith",
  "explanation": "The concept of Economic Man was put forward by Adam Smith who asserted that everyone has a natural propensity to trade and if given a free rein, this tendency would stimulate economic activity, resulting in an increase in the production of goods. The profit motive is a natural instinct which inspires every trader in his activity. The selfish motive of the enterpriser is conducive to the general good because it harmonizes with national prosperity."
