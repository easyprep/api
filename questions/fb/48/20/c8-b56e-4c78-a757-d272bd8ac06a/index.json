  "question": "During the early medieval India, founders of which among the following dynasty was elected by the people?",
  "option1": "Pratiharas",
  "option2": "Palas",
  "option3": "Gangas",
  "option4": "Solankis",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Palas",
  "explanation": "The history of Bengal from the death of Harsha up to the ascendancy of the Palas is shrouded in bscruity. At this time, west bengal was known as Gauda and East Bengal as Vanga. Bengal was subjected to internal disorder what is called Matsya Nyaya (the rule of strong devouring the weak), leading up to a revolution by which a local chief Gopala (AD 750-770) was elected (Grahita) by the people. This is however, to be taken not in a strictly democractic or constitutional sense which was not possible in these days. Perhaps the election was nothing but his acceptance as a ruler by the people."
