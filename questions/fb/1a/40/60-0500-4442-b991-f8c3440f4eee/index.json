  "option1": "Jammu & Kashmir",
  "option2": "Sikkim",
  "option3": "Odisha",
  "option4": "Andaman and Nicobar Islands",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Sikkim",
  "explanation": "The four tribal groups in Sikkim i.e. Bhutia, Lepcha, Limboo and Tamang, were frequently in news due to proposal to increase the number of seats in the Sikkim Assembly from 32 to 40 to accommodate people of these tribes fair representation of communities as per rules laid down in constitution. As per constitutional provisions, the total number of seats for STs should be in proportion to the population. But as per the Delimitation Act, 2002, the number of seats in an Assembly of any State can only be readjusted on the basis of the first census conducted after 2026. Currently, the Bhutia tribal groups are fairing much better than the Limboo tribal groups when measured in terms of socio-political well being in the state."
