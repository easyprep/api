  "question": "With reference to various Parliamentary Committees, how the \"Public Accounts Committee\" is different from the \"Committee on Estimates\"?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>While the Public Accounts Committee is a financial committee, Committee on estimates is not a financial committee</li>\r\n<li>While the Public Accounts Committee has members from both Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha, members of Committee on estimates are only from Lok Sabha</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "In this question the first statement is not correct. There are three Financial Committees viz.<br />• Committee or Public Accounts<br />• Committee on estimates<br />• Committee on Public Undertakings.<br />The members of Public Accounts Committee and Committee on Public Undertakings are from both houses. The Committee on estimates has all 30 members from Lok Sabha. The difference between the Estimates committee and public Accounts committee is that Estimates committee scrutinizes the Estimates while the Public Accounts Committee scrutinizes the appropriation and manner of spending."
