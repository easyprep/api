  "question": "Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link, which is in news recently, is the proposed tunnel to connect islands of which of the following countries?",
  "option1": "Denmark and Germany",
  "option2": "France and Italy",
  "option3": "UK and Spain",
  "option4": "Brazil and Chile",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Denmark and Germany",
  "explanation": "Recently, German authorities approved an $8 billion rail and road tunnel linking Denmark and Germany, despite environmental objections. The project comprises a four-lane motorway and a two-track railway. It is part-funded by the European Union (EU). The 19 km Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link  is a planned immersed tunnel that is proposed to connect the Danish island of Lolland with the German island of Fehmarn. It was due to be completed in 2024, but has been delayed by environmental protests in Germany. The link would cross over the Fehmarn Belt in the Baltic Sea – 18 km wide – hence providing a direct link by railway and highway between northern Germany and Lolland, and thence to the Danish island of Zealand and Copenhagen.  Once completed, it will become the world’s longest road and rail tunnel, and will open new socio-economic opportunities on both sides of the border."
