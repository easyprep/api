  "question": "Which boxing punch is in which a punch is employed to prevent aggressive boxers from lunging in and involves two parts, one is regular and the other is footwork?",
  "option1": "Bolo punch",
  "option2": "Overhead punch",
  "option3": "Check hook punch",
  "option4": "Jab punch",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Check hook punch",
  "explanation": "A check hook is employed to prevent aggressive boxers from lunging in. There are two parts to the check hook. The first part consists of a regular hook. The second, trickier part involves the footwork. As the opponent lunges in, the boxer should throw the hook and pivot on his left foot and swing his right foot 180 degrees around. If executed correctly, the aggressive boxer will lunge in and sail harmlessly past his opponent like a bull missing a matador."
