It has cited domestic compulsions and has asked for more time for the agreement to be sealed. Background India and Myanmar share 1,643 km unfenced border along four states viz. Arunachal Pradesh (520 km), Nagaland (215 km), Manipur (398 km) and Mizoram (510 km) and permit free movement regime. To give it shape, Central Government had asked four border states with Myanmar to distribute\"border pass\" to all the residents living within 16 km. The agreement will facilitate movement of people on basis of valid passports and visas which will enhance economic and social interaction between two places.",
