  "question": "In context of the recent decision to go ahead with the 45,000 crore INR defence procurement project for submarines, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Nuclear powered submarines are capable of remaining submerged for longer than diesel- electric powered submarines.</li>\n<li>The Chakra submarine, which is featured in the procurement plan, is of German origin.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Indian Navy is to procure 6 submarines through the 45,000 crore INR defence procurement project. Indiaâ€™s submarines are either nuclear powered or diesel-electric powered. Nuclear powered submarines are capable of staying submerged for longer periods because they are capable of producing their own oxygen. In contrast, conventional submarines need to regularly surface.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Chakra class of submarines are originated from Russia. These are nuclear powered and can remain underwater for several weeks at a stretch as they produce their own oxygen. Sindhughosh class submarines- also of Russian origin- are also featured on the plan. These submarines are to be manufactured in India."
