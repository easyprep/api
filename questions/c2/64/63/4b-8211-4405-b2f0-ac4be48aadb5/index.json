  "question": "Which of the following observations about the elasticity of different materials is / are correct?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Glass is more elastic than rubber</li>\r\n<li>Elasticity of steel is more than that of copper</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Elasticity of steel is more than that of copper and so for equal applied force, the elongation of steel spring is less than that of copper for same initial length. This implies that the steel spring can bear a larger tension before the elastic limit is crossed. Further, steel recovers its original state quicker than copper after the deforming force is removed. Due to this reason, steel is preferred in making springs in comparison to steel. The second statement is correct. Glass is more elastic than rubber because for a given applied force per unit area, the strain produced in glass is much smaller than produced in rubber."
