  "explanation": "Miyawaki method is a method of urban afforestation by turning backyards into mini-forests.<br />It includes planting trees as close as possible in the same area which not only saves space, but the planted saplings also support each other in growth and block sunlight reaching the ground, thereby preventing the growth of weed.It helps to create a forest in just 20 to 30 years while through conventional methods it takes anywhere between 200 to 300 years."
