  "question": "The behaviour of the monsoon over India is affected by which of the following phenomena/events? <ol> <li>Rossby waves</li> <li>Indian Ocean Dipole</li> <li>El-Nino</li> </ol> Select the correct option from codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Rossby Waves are meridional waves like pattern in circumpolar areas and plays vital role in energy exchange between polar and temperate areas. These waves flow northwards for six months and then southwards for another six months. Rossby waves are also generated by the heating over the Bay of Bengal. Rossby wave breaking (RWB) also takes place during June-July in West Asia. The interaction between these waves and monsoonal circulation affects the Indian Monsoon. Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is a system of oscillating sea surface temperatures in which the western Indian Ocean becomes alternately warmer and then colder than the eastern part of the ocean. El Nino is the name given to the warm ocean currents along the Pacific coast of South America. It impacts the Indian Monsoon badly."
