  "question": "A UK study linked water carriage, clean drinking water access and sanitation with maternal and child health recently. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The study showed that access to tapped water lowered the chances of child death by 50%.</li>\n<li>Children of women who fetch water from far off places face the ‘Hobson’s Choice’.</li>\n<li>The Nal se Jal scheme aims to provide piped water to all rural households.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "All are incorrect",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe study linked increased chances of death/ other ill effects, both on children and women who have to depend on water carriage. The study involved a sample of 2.7 million people from 41 countries. Water carriage was linked to higher death rate (50%), diarrhoea, etc.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nHobson’s Choice is a condition where an individual can take both the offered options or none at all. This is faced by the children of women engaged in water carriage. They are either left alone for prolonged time period, increasing the risk of accidents or taken along on dangerous/ difficult routes.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nThe Nal se Jal scheme under the new Jal Shakti ministry seeks to provide piped drinking water to all rural households by 2024. It is a component of the Jal jeevan mission. This will help reduce the risk faced by the women and children due to dependence on far off water sources."
