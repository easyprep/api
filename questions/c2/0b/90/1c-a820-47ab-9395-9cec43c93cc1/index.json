  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Both the statements are correct. Kindly note that minimum support price scheme for MFPs was<a href=\\\"http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=171082\\\"> launched </a>in 2017 September. However, as per <a href=\\\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/government-to-release-tribal-funds-ahead-of-polls/articleshow/65958065.cms\\\">recent news,</a> the minimum support price scheme for minor forest produce (MFP) has been a complete non-starter. The centre has released unspent funds of Rs. 1500 crore on the basis of its own assessment but is now looking towards making changes in the scheme."
