  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 4",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe forest fires have increased drastically in India- almost double the 2003 numbers. The 2015-17 period saw a staggering 125% spike in forest fires. Climate change and recurring heat-waves of high intensity are some of the main reasons. They are also man-made- sometimes initiated to cover the tracks of illegal timber smuggling.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nMost number of forest fires occur in Madhya Pradesh. In 2017, there were 4781 incidents in MP. Odisha and Chhattisgarh also account for a large percentage of India’s forest fires. 23 states in India have reported increase in forest fire incidence. In Punjab, the incidence increased by seven fold.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nLarge Forest Fires Monitoring Programme was launched by the FSI/ Forest Survey of India in January, 2019. It is under the FAST/ FSI Fire Alert System. It gives real time data about forest fires. It will continuously assess the fire’s progress, identify areas for restoration work and also carry out damage assessment.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is correct:\nUttarakhand sees frequent fires, such as the 2016 incident. The fires have been blamed on the pine trees. These trees constitute 16% of the area and their resins are flammable. The state government is looking to generate electricity from the pine needles. The Pirul project will generate 675 KW of power when implemented."
