  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The Bill would help in laying down measures to deter economic offenders from evading the process of Indian law by remaining outside the jurisdiction of Indian courts. The cases where the total value involved in such offences is Rs.100 crore or more, will come under the purview of this Bill.\r\n<strong><u> Some of the   Salient features of the Bill:</u></strong>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Application before the Special Court for a declaration that an individual is a fugitive economic offender;</li>\r\n<li>Attachment of the property of a fugitive economic offender;</li>\r\n<li>Issue of a notice by the Special Court to the individual alleged to be a fugitive economic offender;</li>\r\n<li>Confiscation of the property of an individual declared as a fugitive economic offender resulting from the proceeds of crime;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Confiscation of other  property belonging to such offender in India and abroad, </strong>including benami property;</li>\r\n<li>Disentitlement of the fugitive economic offender from defending any civil claim; and</li>\r\n<li>An Administrator will be appointed to manage and dispose of the confiscated property under the Act.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nFurther, the Bill does not require the authorities to obtain a search warrant or ensure the presence of witnesses before a search<strong>.  </strong>This differs from other laws, such as the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973, which contain such safeguards.   These safeguards protect against harassment and planting of evidence."
