  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe SEBI had appointed a panel to strengthen the norms regulating related party transactions. One of the proposals by the panel is to define any entity or person holding 20% or more of the listed entity’s holdings to be considered as related party.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:   </strong>\nAn entity holding a large enough stake (20% or more) of the holding- either directly or indirectly- is to be considered as related party. SEBI had formed the panel under the chairmanship of Ramesh Srinivasan in November, 2019 to review the RPT policies."
