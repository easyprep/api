  "answer": "BharatNet",
  "explanation": "The Government of India (GoI) has launched 5,000 Wi-Fi Choupals in villages and delivery of rail tickets through Common Service Centres (CSCs). It was inaugurated by Electronics and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad in New Delhi on June 11, 2018. The move is aimed at transforming rural Internet connectivity through BharatNet. The WiFi Choupals will enable people in rural areas with an effective Internet access for their various digital processes. CSC has also tied up with IRCTC for booking of railway tickets. As per the agreement, all 2.9 lakh CSC will be able to book both reserved and unreserved train tickets. This will enable people in rural areas/villages to book tickets through CSC rather than going to the booking centres mainly located in cities. The BharatNet is the Central Government\\'s rural broadband connectivity project to connect 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats (GPs) by Optical Fibre Cable (OFC)."
