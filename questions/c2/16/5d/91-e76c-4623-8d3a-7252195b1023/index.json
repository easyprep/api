  "question": "A ‘black hole’ is a body in space which does not allow any radiation to come out. This property is due to which of the following features?",
  "option1": "very small size",
  "option2": "very large size",
  "option3": "very high density",
  "option4": "very low density",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "very high density",
  "explanation": "A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting gravitational acceleration so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it. ... This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to observe. The theoretical density of a black hole depends on how big it is and how you define its size. The density at the center of a black hole is infinite (it\\'s a famous \\\"singularity\\\", which leads to difficulties in modern cosmology). g/cm<sup>3</sup> for Aerogels and up to the heaviest substance, osmium, with a density of 22.61 g/cm<sup>3</sup>."
