  "question": "Nepal and India inaugurated South Asiaâ€™s first oil pipeline that runs across borders. In this context, consider the following statements about this project:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>India is to import petroleum products from Nepal through this pipeline.</li>\n<li>Nepal is to import oil through this project from India.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nIndia is an exporter of petroleum products to Nepal. The project is seen as a move to improve ties with the Himalayan state in light of China making inroads into it in form of aids and hydroelectric projects. The project received 3.24 billion INR from India as fund.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Himalayan state depends solely on India for its oil imports. Till date the imports were by use of tankers. The pipeline will enable transport of 2 million metric tonnes of petroleum product per year. This will reduce the oil prices in Nepal."
