  "question": "What will be the apparent frequency when the both source of the sound and listener move in the same direction with same velocity?",
  "option1": "it will be more than the actual frequency",
  "option2": "it will be less than the actual frequency",
  "option3": "it will be equal to the actual frequency",
  "option4": "None",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "it will be equal to the actual frequency",
  "explanation": "When both moves in the same direction with same velocity n' = n, i.e. there will be no Doppler effect because relative motion between source and listener is zero."
