  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 3",
  "option4": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "<strong>Data Secure Status - is related to EU trade </strong>\r\nThe Indian government has been thriving hard to get the “Data Secure status” from European Union but has not received it as of now. If the European Union provides India with “Data Protection” status, it will lift restrictions on the flow of outsourcing business to India. This would help Indian IT Industry to a great extent. India is not currently included in the list of countries considered data secure by the EU, thus preventing the flow of sensitive data, especially those related to telemedicine, to reach India.\r\n<strong>Preferential Market Access - is related to electronics / telecom industry</strong>\r\nThis policy required the foreign suppliers to source local content / components in India. Domestic equipment makers, however, are all backing the preferential market access (PMA), seen as crucial to efforts to boost local manufacturing, curb imports and create more jobs in the South Asian nation.\r\n<strong>National Fibre Authority</strong>\r\nUnder National Digital Communications Policy, a central authority, called the National Fibre Authority, will be put in place to handle utility between new initiatives being launched under the NDCP. The authority would coordinate access, standardisation of costs and timelines with respect to the National Digital Grid between the centre, states and local bodies. More importantly, such a mechanism will hopefully help remove barriers to obtaining approvals."
