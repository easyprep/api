  "option3": "All are incorrect",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Kuntala Waterfalls is the highest in Telangana. It is 147 feet high. It is a popular tourist spot but is also the site of frequent accidents and death. The reason is the fissure structure in the rockbed which is hazardous for unsuspecting visitors. Other reasons include alcohol consumption. The high accident rate here has made the government close the site to tourists.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe falls is located in a forest inhabited by the Gond tribe. The region has many Adivasis and they consider the waterfalls to be sacred. Because of this, they refuse to let the government close off the site. The falls is named after the mythological character of Shakuntala.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nThe waterfall is located in the mountain range of Sahyadri. Its source is the River Kadam. Sahyadri is also known as the Western Ghats. The mountains are one of the four watersheds of India. Godavari is one of the rivers arising from it and Kadam River is a minor tributary of the Godavari."
