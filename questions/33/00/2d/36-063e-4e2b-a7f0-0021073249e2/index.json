  "answer": "Germany",
  "explanation": "Germany celebrates the \"Volksfest\" festival. A Volksfest is a large event in Germany which usually combines a beer festival or wine festival and a travelling funfair. Attractions may include amusement rides, games of chance and skill, and food and merchandise vendors. When there is a beer festival, it is common to build one or more beer tents (Festzelte), usually sponsored by a brewery and set up beer gardens where it is possible to order traditional food and try the Festbier (beer specially brewed for the season). A large beer tent will have hundreds of wooden benches with a seating capacity in the thousands and offer live music, being a favourite place for patrons to spend the evening. The Oktoberfest is the world's biggest Volksfest and occurs yearly in Munich."
