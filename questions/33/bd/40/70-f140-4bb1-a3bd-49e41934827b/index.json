  "answer": "1, 2 & 4 Only",
  "explanation": "Blood, bones, hair with root, saliva, semen, teeth, and tissue can be used to study the DNA. The red blood cells (RBCs) contain haemoglobin and carry oxygen throughout the body, but it is true that they lack the DNA-containing nuclei found in all other cells. Unlike RBCs, white blood cells do contain nuclei and the informative molecule inside, DNA."
