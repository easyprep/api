  "answer": "1, 2 and 4",
  "explanation": "The present day improved varieties of rice, wheat and pulses possess all or combinations of major characters which enable the farmers for commercial production.  Further, improved varieties play pivotal role in enhancing productivity of any crop. Improved variety alone can add 20‐25 % to increased productivity, even if other components of production remain the same. Improved varieties/hybrids of cereals and millets helped in ushering the green revolution.  Hence selection of a variety / hybrid by the farmer for crop production is very important to realise the benefits."
