  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nKazakhstan is the world’s largest supplier of uranium. Together with Canada and Australia, Kazakhstan produces 70% of the world’s uranium. Kazakhstan’s Kazatomprom is a major supplier of uranium to India. India also sources uranium from Canada, Argentina and Nambia.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nUranium is not a rare earth element. It is noted for its radioactivity and use in nuclear energy and diagnostics fields. Rare earths are a collection of 17 elements from the lanthanides and actinides category of elements. They are often found in association with uranium in minerals and ores."
