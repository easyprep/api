  "explanation": "The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Mission of NASA has discovered its first Earth-size planet - HD 21749c. The newly-discovered planet is about 89% Earthâ€™s diameter. The planet is likely very hot, with surface temperatures perhaps as high as 800 degrees F (427 degrees C). It orbits HD 21749, a K-type dwarf star located 53 light-years away in the southern constellation. It is likely a rocky as it circles its parent star in just 7.8 days. This is the 10th confirmed planet discovered by TESS, and hundreds of additional candidates are now being studied."
