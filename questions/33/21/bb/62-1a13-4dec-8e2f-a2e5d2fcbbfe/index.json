  "option1": "Drug Trafficking",
  "option2": "Women Trafficking",
  "option3": "Child Trafficking",
  "option4": "Weapons smuggling",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Child Trafficking",
  "explanation": "It is estimated that 200,000 persons are trafficked in India every year. Only 10% of human trafficking in India is international, while almost 90% is interstate. Nearly 40,000 children are abducted every year of which 11000 remain untraced according to a report by the National Human Rights Commission of India. Although there is an Immoral Traffic Prevention Act in place against trafficking, it only refers to trafficking for prostitution hence does not provide comprehensive protection for children. Nor does the Act provide clear definition of &#8216;trafficking&#8217;. <u>Also, India has failed to uphold the the Palemo Protocol, which provides protection to children against trafficking.</u>"
