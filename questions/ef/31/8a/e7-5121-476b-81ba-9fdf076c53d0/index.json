  "question": "Which one of the following statements is not correct?",
  "option1": "The boiling point of an aqueous solution is higher than that of pure water",
  "option2": "Addition of solutes to a solution causes an increase in its water potential",
  "option3": "The vapour pressure of the water in a solution is lower than that of pure water",
  "option4": "When a solution is separated from water by a semi permeable membrane, water movement can be prevented by applying pressure to the solution.",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Addition of solutes to a solution causes an increase in its water potential",
  "explanation": "Adding solute lowers the water potential. When a solution is enclosed by a rigid cell wall, the movement of water into the cell will exert pressure on the cell wall. This increase in pressure within the cell will raise the water potential."
