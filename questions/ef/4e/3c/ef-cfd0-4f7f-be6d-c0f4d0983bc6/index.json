  "question": "The \"Bubi People\" are the indigenous community of which country?",
  "option1": "Ghana",
  "option2": "Guyana",
  "option3": "Equatorial Guinea",
  "option4": "Guinea",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Equatorial Guinea",
  "explanation": "Bubi people, also known as Bobe or Voove or Ewota or Bantu Bubi, are a Bantu ethnic group of people living in Central Africa indigenous to Bioko Island of Equatorial Guinea. Portuguese and Spanish colonialism and the consequent civil war lead to the drastic population decline of Bubi people. The Bubis are known for a particular type of tattooing that extends from the times of slave-trading and persists, though not as commonly, to the current day. Elder tribesmen carve grooves or lines into the faces of Bubi children - the original purpose of these markings was for self-identification among slave groups in the New World, and possibly to dissuade slavers from taking them in the first place, as the grooves look disfiguring to Western eyes."
