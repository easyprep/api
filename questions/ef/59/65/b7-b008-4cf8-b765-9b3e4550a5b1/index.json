  "question": "A maiden bilateral Mine Counter Measure Exercise was held in November. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It was conducted between India and Japan.</li>\n<li>Mine Counter Measure Vessels function as minesweepers but not as mine hunters.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Mine Counter Measure Exercise is the bilateral exercise between India and Japan held in November. This maiden engagement involved the participation of the Indian navy and the Japanese Maritime Self- Defence Force. Naval mines were first used during the Crimean War of the 1850s.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nMine Counter Measure Vessels play both the roles- of a minesweeper and a mine hunter. A mine hunter is a vessel used to detect and destroy naval mines. A minesweeper does not detect such explosives. It is simply used to neutralise and remove them."
