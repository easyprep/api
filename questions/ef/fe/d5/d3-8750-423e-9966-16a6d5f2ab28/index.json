  "question": "With reference to the recent reports of the vulnerability of the Clownfish population across the world, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>They are found only in the Atlantic Ocean.</li>\n<li>Clownfishes breed in sea anemones.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Clownfish is a marine fish species that is found in warm water oceans like the Indian Ocean, Red Sea, etc. They are not found in the Atlantic Ocean. They are found in the Pacific Ocean too, especially in the Great Barrier Reef region.\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Clownfish are known for their association with sea anemones. They are the only fishes that aren’t attacked by the sea anemone’s nematocysts (a kind of sting). The Clownfish breed in these anemones which provides a habitat while the fish safeguards it from other fishes."
