  "question": "As per which section of the RTI Act, the  Government of India (GoI) cannot refuse information if disclosure in public interest overshadows certain ‘protected interests’?",
  "option1": "Section 7(2)",
  "option2": "Section 6(2)",
  "option3": "Section 8(2)",
  "option4": "Section 9(2)",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Section 8(2)",
  "explanation": "Supreme Court Justice K M Joseph has recently delivered a separate judgment in the Rafale case. He countered the claim made by the Government of India (GoI) for privilege over Rafale purchase documents under the Official Secrets Act (OSA), which affected national security and relations with France. He stated that the Right to Information (RTI) Act supersedes the OSA. By referring to Section 8(2) of the RTI Act, Justice Joseph said the government cannot refuse information if disclosure in public interest overshadows certain ‘protected interests’. Hence, the separate judgment also offers a scathing critique on journalistic bias. The judge said “controlling business interests and political allegiances\\\" have eroded journalistic responsibility. The RTI Act confers on ordinary citizens the ‘priceless right’ to demand information even in matters affecting national security and relations with a foreign state."
