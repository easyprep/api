China has identified nations like India, Maldives &amp; Sri Lanka that connect its ports with Africa’s eastern coast. The Indian Government is trying to counter Maritime Silk Road of China with its own strategies which include revival of ancient <strong>spice route,</strong> ancient <strong>Cotton Route</strong> and the so called Project Mausam. Further, we note that India’s first cotton exports date back to the 1st century CE. There were regular supplies of large quantities of cloth of ordinary quality from Tagara (Ter in Maharashtra)."
