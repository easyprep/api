  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nRavines are mostly concentrated around the Vindhyan Ranges. These were formed millions of years ago and are mostly concentrated in the states of UP, MP, Gujarat and Rajasthan. The ravines were generated during the collision of the Indian Peninsula into the Eurasian plate to form the Himalayas.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThough ravines were formed millions of years ago, they are being expanded today due to soil erosion. Various bodies like Foundation for Ecological Security are adopting low cost techniques to curb the expansion. They have made use of fast growing bamboos to prevent soil erosion."
