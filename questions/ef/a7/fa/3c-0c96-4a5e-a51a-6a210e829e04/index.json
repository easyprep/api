  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about the soil chemistry?<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>In arid and semi-arid regions, soils tend to be alkaline.</li>\r\n<li>Soils in humid regions tend to be acidic.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",

  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "An important aspect of soil chemistry is acidity, alkalinity (baseness), or neutrality. Low pH values indicate an acidic soil, and a high pH indicates alkaline conditions. In arid and semi-arid regions, soils tend to be alkaline and soils in humid regions tend to be acidic."
