The lamps made for temples are artistically used in South India. The lamp usually consists of four parts—base (Keezhbagam), stem (kandam), oil container (Thanguli) and the apex or Prabhai. The Thanguli or oil container consists of V-shaped spouts to hold the wicks. These four parts are joined together with the help of screw threads. The lamps are suspended from the ceiling and richly decorated and always excellent in workmanship and design.</li>\r\n</ul>"
