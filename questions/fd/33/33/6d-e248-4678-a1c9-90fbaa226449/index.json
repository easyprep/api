  "question": "Use of magnetic water has been found more beneficial in agricultural&nbsp;applications like growth of legumes, chick peas and black eyed beans etc. With this reference, consider the following statements: <ol> <li>Plants treated with magnetic water have more water holding capacity than those treated with normal water</li> <li>Magnetic water increases the surface tension of water which facilitates faster movement of nutrients and water within soil</li> <li>Plants treated with magnetic water have more height than those treated with normal water</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "<u>Second statement is incorrect</u> because magnetic water decreases the surface tension of water which facilitates faster movement of water and nutrients in soil. Magnetic water is water passed through a magnetic field, which lead to change on behaviour of water molecules and salts ions, which leads to change in water physical properties. Magnetic water leads to lowering the water surface tension, which allows water and nutrients to move faster within the upper soil horizon and reach the root zone in a shorter time."
