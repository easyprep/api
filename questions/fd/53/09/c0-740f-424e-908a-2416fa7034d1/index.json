  "question": "The diagonal of a square A is (a+b). The diagonal of a square whose are is twice the area of square A, is",
  "option1": "$latex \\sqrt{2}(a-b)$",
  "option2": "$latex \\sqrt{2}(a+b)$",
  "option3": "$latex 2(a+b)^{2}$",
  "option4": "$latex 2(a+b)$",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "$latex \\sqrt{2}(a+b)$",
  "explanation": "Area of the square A = $latex \\\\frac{\\\\left ( diagonal \\\\right )^{2}}{2}= \\\\frac{\\\\left ( a+b \\\\right )^{2}}{2}&s=1$\r\nArea of the new square \r\n$latex = \\\\frac{\\\\left ( a+b \\\\right )^{2}}{2}\\\\times 2 = \\\\left ( a+b \\\\right )^{2}&s=1$\r\n$latex => side = (a+b)$\r\n$latex \\\\therefore Diagonal = \\\\sqrt{2}\\\\times side$\r\n$latex = \\\\sqrt{2}(a+b)$\r\nHence option [B] is the right answer."
