  "answer": "Atlantic Ocean",
  "explanation": "The Baffin Bay is located in the North Atlantic Ocean between the Baffin Island of Canada and Greenland Island of Denmark. The Baffin Bay is a marginal sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean via the Davis Strait and the Labrador Sea. The Baffin Bay is connected to the Arctic Ocean via Nares Strait and the Lincoln Sea. The bay is not navigable most of the year because of the ice cover and high density of ice and icebergs in the open areas."
