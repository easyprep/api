  "option1": "Hisar",
  "option2": "Mathura",
  "option3": "Ujain",
  "option4": "Bundelkhand",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Mathura",
  "explanation": "In 1669-70, the Jats of Mathura region rose under the leadership of a local Zamindar Gokul. Religion was main factor behind this revolt because Abdul Nabi, local officer of imperial Mughal government, had destroyed the temples of Hindus and disrespected their women.\r\nWe note here that Jat uprising occurred at a time Mughal government was by no means weak or imbecile. The Mughal army pursued the Jats and the leader Gokul was captured and executed. However, the rebel did not subdue completely. Taking advantage of the civil war amongst the sons of Shahjahan, the Jats again rose in arms and this rebellion finally culminated in establishment of sovereign Jat Kingdom under Raja Surajmal with Bharatpur its capital"
