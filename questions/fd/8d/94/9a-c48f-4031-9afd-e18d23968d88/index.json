  "explanation": "Dakota DC-3 aircraft of 1940's vintage named as 'Parshuram' ones again joined Indian Air Force more than four decades after the fleet was phased out following an illustrious service record. Notably, the Dakota DC-3 VP 905 aircraft was formally inducted at a grand ceremony held at Hindan air force station. The vintage aircraft was accepted by Chief of Air Staff Air Marshal B S Dhanoa from the Rajya Sabha MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar in February this year. The ceremony also included the representatives from the OEM, dignitaries from the High Commission of the UK and the proud veterans of the IAF who have operated this magnificent flying machine.",
