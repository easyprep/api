Since the answer is oral, supplementary questions might follow a starred question.</li>\r\n<li>An un-starred question requires written answer. Since the answer is given in written, there cannot be supplementary questions that follow an un-stared question</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nA question relating to a matter of public importance of an urgent character asked with notice shorter than <strong><u>ten days</u></strong> is called a “<strong>Short Notice Question</strong>” Short Notice questions are generally answered orally"
