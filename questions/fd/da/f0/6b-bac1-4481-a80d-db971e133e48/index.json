  "option1": "A belt of calm and light variable winds near the equator",
  "option2": "A particular area in the centre of the Pacific Ocean",
  "option3": "The region of the upper atmosphere extending upward from the tropopause to about 20 kms above the earth",
  "option4": "None of these",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "A belt of calm and light variable winds near the equator",
  "explanation": "The Doldrums are located a little north of the equator, but the effects can be felt from 5 degrees north of the equator to 5 degrees south of it. The trade winds border the Doldrums both to the north and south. While crossing the Equator, sailors in the 1700\\'s would often get their boats stuck due to lack of wind. They called this area the doldrums. The doldrums, or ITCZ, are part of the general circulation system of the Earth. These winds that get more moist and warm as they travel to the Equator meet at the doldrums."
