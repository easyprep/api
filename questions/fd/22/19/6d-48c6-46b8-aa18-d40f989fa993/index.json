  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Both statements are correct. Koti Lingala has a hoary past as the Satavahana kings used the Godavari for navigation and transportation of goods. It was the first capital of the Satavahana dynasty. It is located amid huge hillocks and thick green cover on the banks of the Godavari, and is considered one of the 16 great Janapada of early India. The Satavahana dynasty rulers used the navigation for the transportation of the goods as was evident from the wharf on the shores of the river Godavari. The shrine was in news recently due to risk of being submerged in the backwaters of the Sripada Yellampalli project."
