These colour codes are- blue, yellow and brown, and depict the level of risk that the MF scheme is likely to have. The blue colour coded box indicates low risk and is an ideal and the safest source of income. It includes instruments such as fixed maturity plans, gilt funds and income funds. The yellow colour coded box indicates medium risk, and is good for those who seek diversification between debt and equity. Brown colour coded box involves high risk and is suited to those with high-risk appetite."
