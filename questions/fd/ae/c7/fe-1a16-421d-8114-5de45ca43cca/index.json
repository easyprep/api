  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Officials of the state",
  "explanation": "The literal meaning of word Mansab is “official appointment of rank and emoluments”. Every important officer of Akbar held a Mansab or a rank in the imperial cadre and his rank was measured on how many horsemen he commanded. Thus, it was a military rank also. These Mansabdars were paid in Zat and Sawar. Zat was a fixed personal salary while sawar was paid as per their rank or number of horsemen to be controlled by them.\r\nAkbar classified the office holders into total 33 grades ranging from mansabs of 10 to 10 thousand. However, these all were broadly categorized into three types as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Those who commanded 10 to 400 horsemen were commonly called <em>mansabdars</em>(officers).</li>\r\n<li>Those who commanded 500 to 2500 horsemen were <em>amirs </em>(nobles)</li>\r\n<li>Those in higher ranks belonged to the category of <em>umara-i-kabir</em>or <em>umara-i-azim</em> (grandees).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe highest amir in the third category was honored with the title of <em>amir-ul-umara</em>."
