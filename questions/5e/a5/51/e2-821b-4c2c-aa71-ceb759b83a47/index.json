  "answer": "Valentina Elangbam",
  "explanation": "The Manipur government has appointed a 9-year-old girl Valentina Elangbam as the Stateâ€™s green ambassador  after  a video of her crying over felled trees goes viral. Hence, the state government issued an order in recognition of her immense love and affection for trees and for generating mass awareness on conservation of the environment for a period of one year from the date of issuing the order.   Valentina is a Class V student of Amutombi Divine Life English School in Kakching town.  She had planted the saplings of two Gulmohar (royal poinciana) trees by the side of a river when she was in Class I. However, in a rude shock to her, the trees were recently cut down as part of a road expansion project. Then, a video of the crying child over the trees was shared on Facebook by her uncle."
