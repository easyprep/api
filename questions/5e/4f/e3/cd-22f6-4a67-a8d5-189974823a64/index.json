  "explanation": "In the first round of the ‘two-plus-two dialogue’ in New Delhi, India and the United States signed military communications pact \\\"COMCASA\\\" , which will give India access to advanced new defence systems like armed drones and will enable the Indian armed forces to exploit existing US-origin platforms much more efficiently.  COMCASA is an India-specific version of the Communication and Information on Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA). It comes into force immediately & is valid for a period 10 years. The term \\\"COMCASA\\\" stands for Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA)  and is one of the four foundational agreements that the U.S. signs with allies and close partners to facilitate interoperability between militaries and sale of high end technology. COMCASA allows India to procure transfer specialised equipment for encrypted communications for US origin military platforms like the C-17, C-130 and P-8Is."
