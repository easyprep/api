  "question": "The 2019 Nobel Prize was awarded for the discovery of 51 Pegasi b. In this context, consider the following statements about 51 Pegasi b:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is a hot Jupiter planet.</li>\n<li>Water is found in its atmosphere.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\n51 Pegasi b is the first extra-solar planet to be discovered. It belongs to a class called the hot Jupiter. This is because it shares many characters with Jupiter and has an orbital period of less than 10 days. It was discovered in 1995.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nIn 2017, water was detected in Pegasiâ€™s atmosphere. It was observed in the day-side atmosphere of the exoplanet using the CRIRES instrument at the Very Large Telescope in Chile. However, the study did not show the presence of carbon dioxide or methane molecules."
