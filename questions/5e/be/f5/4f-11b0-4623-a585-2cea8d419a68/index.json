  "question": "&nbsp; Which of the following increases with increase of highly soluble impurities in water? <ol> <li>Melting point</li> <li>Boiling point</li> <li>Surface tension</li> </ol> &nbsp; Select the correct option from codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "3 Only",
  "option3": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 & 3 Only",
  "explanation": "The melting point of a pure substance is always higher than the melting point of that substance when a small amount of an impurity is present. Melting point decreases with increase of impurity in water. Increase in impurity increases the electrostatic attraction between ions and thus more energy is needed to break the bonds. The surface tension of water increases when highly soluble impurities are added to it."
