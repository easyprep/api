India is mulling over establishing a similar project along its north-western region.\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nIndia’s Green Wall is aimed at combating land degradation and restoration of the Aravali Range. The wall is to stretch from Delhi-Haryana to Gujarat. It is to be about 5km wide and 1,400km long. It is to cut the expansion of the Thar Desert into the adjoining areas.\n&nbsp;"
