  "answer": "4 per cent",
  "explanation": "As per a research paper authored by RBI Deputy Governor Michael Debabrata Patra and another official, maintaining 4 per cent inflation is appropriate for India.<br />The paper highlights that targeting a lower rate could create a deflationary stand to the monetary policy.
