This war began after the Interim Peace period from 13 March 1940 to 25 June 1941 following the Winter War. Finland invaded the Soviet Union to regain the territories lost during the Winter War. The Continuation War led to the victory of the Soviet Union which further leads to the signing of the Moscow Armistice which ceded the Petsamo region and leased the Porkkala Peninsula to the USSR."
