  "answer": "Coal-tar",
  "explanation": "Naphthalene is obtained from either coal tar or petroleum distillation. Naphthalene is derived from a kind of naphtha which is a broad term encompassing any volatile, namable liquid hydrocarbon mixture, including coal tar. It is also produced when things burn, so naphthalene is found in cigarette smoke, car exhaust, and smoke from forest fires. It is used as an insecticide and pest repellent. Naphthalene was first registered as a pesticide in the United States in 1948."
