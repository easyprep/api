  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Lion-tailed Macaque Macaca silenus is an endangered primate endemic to Western Ghats. Even within the Western Ghats, this animal has a limited distribution. These gregarious monkeys live in troops consisting between 12 and 20 individuals. They almost exclusively live on the canopy of the evergreen forests where they move with at a leisurely pace searching for food. They seldom descend to the ground. Being omnivores, these macaques feed on fruits, leaves, insects and other small animals. <em><u>The lion-tailed </u></em><em><u>Macaque </u></em><em><u>is </u></em><em><u>the only Indian macaque with a black coloured coat.</u></em> It measures 50-60 cm. including head and body with the tail measuring another 30-40 cm. The females are slightly smaller. A glossy black coat, long, dark grey or brownish grey hairs growing from the temples and cheeks that form a mane are very characteristic of the species. An interesting feature is the short tail that ends in a tassel of hairs, very similar to that of the Lion, earning it the name. Their dark colour, their habit of living in dimly lit forests and their shy nature make spotting this macaque difficult. However, their occasional call to communicate with members of the troop can give away their presence. Their call resembles the loud cough of a man. The meat of these macaques is supposed to have medicinal value. Hence, they are hunted for their meat, besides their skin. Poaching and destruction of its evergreen forest habitat are major threats to the survival of this species. Albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds, and the great albatrosses (genus Diomedea) have the largest wingspans of any extant birds, reaching up to 12 feet (3.7 m)."
