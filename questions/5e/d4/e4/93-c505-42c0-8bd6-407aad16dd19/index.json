  "question": "Consider the following statements: <ol> <li>Administrator/Lieutenant Governor of a Union Territory has more powers in comparison to the Governor of a State</li> <li>Any change in the provisions of a Union Territory is deemed as change in federal provisions of the constitution, and requires constitutional amendment by the parliament</li> </ol>  Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct. As per Article 239 of the constitution, the Administrator can act “as he thinks fit,” while as per the UT Act, “he can act in his discretion, and his decision shall be final. Article 239AA of the Constitution and Section 44 of the UT Act confer enormous powers on the Administrator. Article 239AA (4) says in the case of difference of opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and his Ministers on any matter, the Lieutenant Governor shall refer it to the President for decision and act according to the decision given thereon by the President. Second statement is incorrect because the Parliament has power, as per Article 239AA (7) and (8), to change the provisions of the UT which will not be deemed to be the Amendment to the Constitution. Thus, the Union Government can exercise executive and legislative power on all State subjects with reference to a Union Territory, which is otherwise not possible in a full-fledged State Government."
