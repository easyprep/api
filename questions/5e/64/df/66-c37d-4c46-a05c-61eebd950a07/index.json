  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only  2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nWith the ascension of Emperor Naruhito, the current imperial era in Japan is called the Reiwa era. When an emperor ascends the Chrysanthemum Throne, his era/ reign is given a name called the gengo. This is used along with western calendar years.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe gengo of the previous monarch, Emperor Akihito, is known as the Heisei era. The era had concluded when the emperor abdicated the throne due to poor health. The Heisei era was preceded by the Showa era. Before that, it was the Taisho era."
