  "question": "A can do a piece of work in 20 days and B can do the same piece of work in 30 days. Find that in how many days both can do the work?",
  "option1": "10 days",
  "option2": "12 days",
  "option3": "14 days",
  "option4": "16 days",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "12 days",
  "explanation": "A\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{20}&s=1$\r\nB\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{30}&s=1$\r\nâˆ´ (A + B)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{20} + \\\\frac{1}{30} = \\\\frac{3+2}{60} = \\\\frac{1}{12}&s=1$\r\nSo, the work will be completed in 12 days if they work together.\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer."
