  "explanation": "&lt;ch^&gt;\r\n<table width=\\\"100%\\\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\\\"100%\\\">Article 75(3) of our constitution incorporates the Principle of Collective Responsibility. This article says that Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to \\\"Lok Sabha\\\". This means that if the Ministry loses the confidence of the “Lok Sabha”, all ministers including those who are from Rajya Sabha have to go. The entire ministry is obliged to resign. This means that ministers fall and stand together. This is called “Rule of Collective Responsibility”. What is the implication of Rule of Individual Responsibility As mentioned above, Individual responsibility means that Individual minister holds the office during the pleasure of the president. It means that this is a “powerful weapon” of the President in the hands of the prime Minister. Losing confidence of the Prime Minister leads to dismissal by the President.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n&lt;ph^&gt;"
