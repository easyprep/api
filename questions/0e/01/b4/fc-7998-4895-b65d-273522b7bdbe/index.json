  "question": "Indian scientists at which organisation have discovered a new enzyme \"Murein Endopeptidase\" to break the bacterial cell wall?",
  "option1": "IIT Delhi",
  "option2": "CCMB",
  "option3": "DRDO",
  "option4": "BARC",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "CCMB",
  "explanation": "Scientists at the Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) have discovered a new enzyme ‘Murein Endopeptidase’ which helps in breaking cell walls of bacteria. This discovery offers a potential for a new drug delivery route to arrest the anti-bacterial resistance through existing antibiotic drugs. Hence, it opens up fresh ways to target microbes, leading to a new wave of antibiotic drugs. The man behind this discovery is Pavan Kumar Chodisetti, research student and his mentor Dr Manjula Reddy. Antibiotics are medicines used to prevent and treat bacterial infections. The findings have been published in the latest issue of Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences, USA"
