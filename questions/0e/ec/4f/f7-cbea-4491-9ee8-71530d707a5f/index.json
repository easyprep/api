  "question": "An article listed at 800 Rs. is sold at successive discounts of 25% and 15%. The buyer desires to sell it off at a profit of 20% after allowing a 10% discount. What would be his list price?",
  "option1": "600 Rs.",
  "option2": "620 Rs.",
  "option3": "640 Rs.",
  "option4": "680 Rs",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "680 Rs",
  "explanation": "Effective discount\r\n$latex = 25+15-\\\\frac{25\\\\times 15}{100}&s=1$\r\n$latex = 40-3.75 = 36.25\\\\%$\r\n∴ CP = (100 - 36.25)% of 800\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{63.75\\\\times 800}{100} = 510\\\\ Rs.&s=1$\r\n∴ To gain 20%, \r\n$latex SP = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{120\\\\times 510}{100} \\\\right ) = 612\\\\ Rs.&s=1$\r\nLet the list price be x Rs. \r\n∴ 90% of x = 612 Rs. \r\n$latex => \\\\frac{90x}{100} = 612&s=1$\r\n$latex x = \\\\frac{61200}{90} = 680\\\\ Rs.&s=1$\r\nHence option [D] is correct answer"
