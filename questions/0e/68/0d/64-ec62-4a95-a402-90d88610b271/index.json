Currently, ASTRA is capable of engaging targets upto a distance of 110 km. The ASTRA missiles are integrated with Sukhoi Su-30 MKI aircrafts of India.<br />Now, DRDO plans to increase the range of the missile to 160 km.

There are also plans to integrate the missiles with other aircrafts like Dassault, MiG-29, HAL Tejas."
