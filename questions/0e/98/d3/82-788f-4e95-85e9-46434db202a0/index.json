  "question": "Which country houses the \"Farasuto Forest Community Nature Reserve\"?",
  "option1": "The Gambia",
  "option2": "Gabon",
  "option3": "Ghana",
  "option4": "Guinea",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "The Gambia",
  "explanation": "Farasuto Forest is a community nature reserve located in The Gambia, which is a relict patch of what might best be described as ‘wet evergreen forest’ though the place is only really wet during the rains – broadly from June to October. About a century ago most of the Gambia was reported to be covered by dense and almost impenetrable forest even after large areas had been cleared for groundnut cultivation. At that time the forests were rich in wildlife and habitat for a variety of large mammals which are nowadays rare (such as hippopotamus, waterbuck, roan) or extinct (such as buffalo, giraffe, elephant, lion etc.). Farasuto Forest is among the few remaining and now isolated forest patches left in the whole of the Gambia. It transpires that the forest surrounding Farasuto was cut down about 60 years ago, that is in the late 1940s. The section which is now the reserve was in earlier days used as a place for ceremonial male and female circumcisions and was therefore spared. It may be compared with the somewhat larger Abuko forest which will be known to many visitors to the country. Abuko is the Gambia's largest remnant block of forest and is apparently the Gambia's most visited tourist destination. Farasuto Forest is small in comparison and lies about 10 miles south-east of Abuko."
