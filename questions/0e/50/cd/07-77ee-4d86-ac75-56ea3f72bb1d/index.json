  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about Ocean Temperature?<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The surface temperature of the oceans declines from the equator towards the poles.</li>\r\n<li>The oceans of the Southern are warmer than that of the Northern Oceans.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "The uppermost 10 percent of the oceans contain more heat than the entire atmosphere. The temperature of the oceans is not uniform.<br />The surface temperature of the oceans declines from the equator towards the poles as the Sun's rays are vertical on the equator and become slanting as one move towards the poles.<br />The Northern Hemisphere has more land area than that of the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, the oceans of the Northern are warmer than that of the Southern Oceans."
