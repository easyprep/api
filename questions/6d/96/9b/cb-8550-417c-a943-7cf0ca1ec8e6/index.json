  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "A&nbsp;peneplain&nbsp;is a&nbsp;low-relief non-constructional&nbsp;plain found on the land surface. An extensive plain formed by the coalescence of&nbsp;pediments is called pediplain. Pediplains are normally formed in areas of&nbsp;arid&nbsp;and&nbsp;semi-arid&nbsp;climate. An&nbsp;abyssal plain&nbsp;is an underwater&nbsp;plain&nbsp;on the deep ocean floor, usually found at depths between 3,000 metres and 6,000 metres. Abyssal plains&nbsp;cover more than 50% of the Earth&#039;s surface."
