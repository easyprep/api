  "explanation": "Demographic Transition is credited to Frank W Notestein, who gave his theory in 1945. This theory was based on the data from western countries, which experienced a transition in demography from the stage of low birth rates and low mortality with a consequent declining population.<br />Fourth stage (low fluctuating ) - Stage of low birth rate and death rate.<br />− In the fourth stage of demographic transition, a low birth rate and low death rate lead to a stationary or declining population.<br />− It is called a stage of stationary population.<br />− Birth and death rates both are low. Population is steady or declining as in many Western European nations at present."
