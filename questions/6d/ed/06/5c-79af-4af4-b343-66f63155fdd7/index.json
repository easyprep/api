  "question": "Who is the author of the book “On Fire”?",
  "option1": "David Warner",
  "option2": "Ben Stokes",
  "option3": "Virender Sehwag",
  "option4": "AB de Villiers",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Ben Stokes",
  "explanation": "Stokes claimed in his new book On Fire that Warner had \\\"his heart set on disrupting me\\\" throughout his unbeaten 135, which saved England from almost-certain defeat in the third Test. He added that he had been motivated by the idea of shaking Warner\\'s hand at the end of the game. Australia captain Tim Paine has hit out at Ben Stokes after the England all-rounder said David Warner\\'s on-field sledging had inspired his match-winning Ashes hundred at Headingley."
