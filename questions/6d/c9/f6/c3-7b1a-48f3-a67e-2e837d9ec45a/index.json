  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Sravasti was located in Uttar Pradesh around area of Balrampur in modern Uttar Pradesh. It is closely associated with the life of Buddha because Buddha had spent 24 Chaturmasas here. Thus, we can say that most of monastic life of Buddha was spent in Shravasti.  Amaravati in Andhrapradesh’s Guntur district is also known as Dhanyakataka or Dharanikota and was the site of a great Buddhist Stupa built in pre-Mauryan times, ruled by Satavahana kings. Borobudur is located in Indonesia and comprises six square platforms topped by three circular platforms, and is decorated with 2,672 relief panels and 504 Buddha statues."
