  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "<strong>Swine Flu<br /></strong>Swine flu is thought to be spread mainly by coughing and sneezing by infected people. <br /><strong>Ebola</strong> <br />Ebola spreads by direct contact. There seems to be no evidence indicating that Ebola virus is spread by coughing or sneezing. Ebola virus is transmitted through direct contact with the blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with Ebola; the virus is not transmitted through the air (like measles virus). However, droplets (e.g., splashes or sprays) of respiratory or other secretions from a person who is sick with Ebola could be infectious, and therefore certain precautions (called standard, contact, and droplet precautions) are recommended for use in healthcare settings to prevent the transmission of Ebola virus from patients sick with Ebola to healthcare personnel and other patients or family members. <br /><strong>AIDS and Malaria</strong><br />AIDS and Malaria donâ€™t spread by coughing and sneezing."
