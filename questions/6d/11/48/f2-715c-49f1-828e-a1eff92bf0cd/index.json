  "explanation": "Laski was concerned about the undemocratic control of industry and politics by the ecconomic overloads in society. in order to transform this state of affairs he shifts from his socialist solutions to an alternative scheme of democratization of power in which he identified four bases of economic power -\r\n1. Supply of capital and credit\r\n2. Ownership and control of land\r\n3. Control of Import and Export\r\n4. Control of transport\r\nTherefore, socialization of these vital resources will avert concentration of economic power in society and start the process of democratization of power."
