  "answer": "A burial mound",
  "explanation": "A tumulus (plural tumuli) is a mound of earth and stones raised over a grave or graves. There are two tumuli at Marathon, Greece. One is a burial mound or \"Soros\" that houses the ashes of 192 Athenians who fell during the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC. The other houses the inhumed bodies of the Plataeans who fell during that same battle. The burial mound dominates the plain of Marathon, where the eponymous battle took place, along with the tumulus of the Plataeans, and a victory column erected by the Athenians to commemorate their victory over Darius' Persian expedition. The tumulus is encompassed in a park today.",
