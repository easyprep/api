  "question": "6.4 billion USD was spent by UNCCD member states to combat land degradation between 2017 and 2019. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The Land Degradation Neutrality Fund/ LDNF is aimed at achieving sustainable development goal no.15.</li>\n<li>The fund is managed by the World Bank.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe LDN fund was launched in Ordos, China in 2017. It aimed to raise 300 million USD but it has barely raised about a 100 million USD. A report by the Global Environment Facility puts annual spending to tackle land degradation and desertification at 450 billion USD. The LDNF was meant to achieve goal 15 of SDG- this is ‘life on land’.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe fund is managed by a private investment management firm Mirova. It is a firm that is dedicated to responsible investing and it was selected for the role by a competitive process. The fund is backed by several bodies like the European investment Bank, French Development Agency, etc."
