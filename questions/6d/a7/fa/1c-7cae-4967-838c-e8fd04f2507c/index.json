The city itself was founded as the capital of Mughal Empire in 1571 by Emperor Akbar, The name of the city is derived from the village called Sikri. An Archaeological Survey of India excavation from 1999-2000 indicated that there was a habitation, temples and commercial centres here before Akbar built his capital. The dynastic architecture of Fatehpur Sikri was modelled on Timurid forms and styles. The city was built massively and preferably with red sandstone. The city\\'s architecture reflects both the Hindu and Muslim form of domestic architecture popular in India at the time."
