In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The National Framework for Malaria Elimination seeks to eliminate the disease by 2020.</li>\n<li>Cerebral malaria can cause brain damage.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe National for Malaria Elimination looks to eliminate the disease by 2030. It is in line with the WHO Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016â€“2030 and the Asia Pacific Leaders Malaria Alliance Malaria Elimination Roadmap. The project seeks to make the low and moderately endemic states malaria-free by 2022.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe cerebral malaria can result in brain damage. It is the leading cause of neurological defects in African children. It is caused by the infection of <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>. This can cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the brain tissues. It mainly affects the cerebellum of brain.\n&nbsp;"
