  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "First statement is incorrect because the event led Gandhi to call off the Non-Cooperation movement from Bardoli in February 1922. Second statement is correct that there was a schism in the Congress. Third statement is incorrect. Swaraj Party took a resolution to boycott elections and not rest before attaining swaraj Moti lal Nehru, C R Das, N C Kelkar, GS Gharpade and S Srinivas founded the Swaraj party. The third statement is incorrect, as they chose a middle path, as none of them was capable to lead such a large scale movement. So, they decided swaraj within the British Raj and that `s what led them to contest the elections and win some handsome number of seats."
