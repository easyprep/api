  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nLIDAR is Light detection and ranging technology. The Central railway zone is looking to implement this in its network after the technology’s use in the Konkan railways. It will create 3D maps to detect faults and cracks in the tracks in matter of minutes, enabling immediate response. It will minimise human intervention and reduce staff causalities.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nAutomated Train Examination System/ ATES was introduced in the Central railway zone. It eliminates the need for manual monitoring. It was developed by Konkan Railway Corporation limited. It was developed as part of Make in India initiative, to check for cases of hot axle, brake binding etc., on all trains passing through the track on which it’s installed.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nRashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh was a fund set up in 2017-18 for critical safety works in the railways. It was on the recommendation of Dr. Anil Kakodhar - a former chairman of Atomic Energy Commission. It is a non-lapsable fund of 20,000 crore INR."
