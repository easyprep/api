The main attraction during the fair was the sale and purchase of Chamurthi horses â€” an endangered species known as the \\'ship of the cold desert\\'. The Lavi Fair is approximately 400 years old & dates back to the time when Raja Kehari Singh of Rampur Bushahr state signed a treaty to promote trade with Tibet. Rampur  was once a major trade centre as it is located on the old silk route connecting Afghanistan, Tibet and Ladakh. The traders from Tibet used to bring raw wool, herbs and leather products and take back wheat flour, rice, spices, butter, farm implements and livestock."
