  "question": "With reference to the Asia Land Forum conducted in Udaipur, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Pastoralism is a major contributor to bio-diversity loss.</li>\n<li>India has a policy for grazing lands.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe experts at the Asia Land Forum in Udaipur called for recognition of the positive contribution of pastoralism to the environment. The practice is reported to conserve bio-diversity and also local ecology. The movement of the small ruminants along the pastoral lands tend to fertilise these areas.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nIndia does not have a national policy for pastoral land. The profession isnâ€™t recognised under law. The pastoralists are classified as SC, ST or other backward community members. The Supreme Court in 2011 had directed the government to construct a policy for grazing lands."
