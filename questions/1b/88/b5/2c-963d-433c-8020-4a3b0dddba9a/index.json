  "question": "A train, 110 m long, is running at a speed of 60 km/hr. How many seconds does it take to cross another train, 170 m long, standing on parallel track ?",
  "option1": "15.6 sec",
  "option2": "16.8 sec",
  "option3": "17.2 sec",
  "option4": "18 sec",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "16.8 sec",
  "explanation": "$latex Speed\\\\ of\\\\ train = \\\\frac{Sum\\\\ of\\\\ length\\\\ of\\\\ both\\\\ trains}{Time\\\\ Taken}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{60\\\\times 5}{18} = \\\\frac{110+170}{t} = \\\\frac{280}{t}&s=1$\r\n$latex => t = \\\\frac{280\\\\times 18}{60\\\\times 5} = 16.8\\\\ seconds&s=1$\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer."
