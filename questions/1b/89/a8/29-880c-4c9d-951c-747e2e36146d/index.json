  "question": "Which of the following causes the drop of water to be in spherical shape?",
  "option1": "Viscosity",
  "option2": "Air resistance",
  "option3": "Surface tension",
  "option4": "Temperature",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Surface tension",
  "explanation": "Surface tension is the tendency of liquid surfaces to shrink into the minimum surface area possible. Surface tension allows insects, usually denser than water, to float and slide on a water surface. It is the reason for the water dropletâ€™s round shape."
