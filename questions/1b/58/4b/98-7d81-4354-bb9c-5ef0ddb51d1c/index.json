  "question": "Which country has developed the World&#039;s first &#039;water-wave laser&#039;?",
  "option1": "China",
  "option2": "Russia",
  "option3": "Israel",
  "option4": "Argentina",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Israel",
  "explanation": "Scientists from Israel have created the world&rsquo;s first &lsquo;water-wave laser&rsquo; that emits a beam through the interaction of light and water waves. A typical laser can be created when the electrons in atoms become \"excited\" by energy absorbed from an outside source causing them to emit radiation in the form of laser light. The &lsquo;water-wave laser&rsquo; may be used in &lsquo;lab-on-a-chip&rsquo; devices to study cell biology and test new drug therapies. It can be used in tiny sensors that combine light waves, sound and water waves."
