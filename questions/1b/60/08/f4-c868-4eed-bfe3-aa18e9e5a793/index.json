  "explanation": "Zonel Sougaijam, a 22-year-old civil engineer from Manipur, has been honoured by Facebook for discovering a WhatsApp bug that violated the privacy of a user. The social media giant awarded $5000 to him and also included him in the ‘Facebook Hall of Fame 2019’ for detecting the WhatsApp bug. Mr. Sougaijam detected that during a voice call through WhatsApp, the bug used to allow the caller to upgrade it to a video call without the authorization and knowledge of the receiver. The caller was then able to see what the other person was doing that breached the privacy of the receiver. Mr. Sougaijam’s name is currently at the 16th position in a list of 94 people, in the ‘Facebook Hall of Fame’ for this year."
