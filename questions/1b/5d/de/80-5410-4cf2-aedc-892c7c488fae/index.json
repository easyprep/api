India is the worldâ€™s second-largest cultivator of bamboo after China with over 130 species. In the Budget presented in Parliament on July 2019, Government of India (GoI) focused on reviving traditional industries such as bamboo, khadi and honey, through a cluster-based approach. It will be done under the Scheme of Fund for Regeneration of Traditional Industries (SFURTI), which aims to organise such industries and artisans into clusters to make them competitive."
