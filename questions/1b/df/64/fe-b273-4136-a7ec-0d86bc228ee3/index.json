  "answer": "Trojan asteroids",
  "explanation": "The large group of asteroids that share the Jupiter's orbit around the Sun are commonly called as Trojan asteroids or Jupiter Trojans. The trojans follow the same orbit of planet but stay either around 60 degrees ahead or 60 degrees behind along the orbit.\r\nRecently, a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii and Queenâ€™s University Belfast have found that 2019 LD2 is the first known Jupiter trojan asteroid to have a comet-like tail. It was first discovered in June 2019 by the ATLAS system funded by NASA. But it could not be observed then, as it passed behind the sun."
