  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong> The red eared terrapin/ turtle is considered as one of the 100 most invasive species by IUCN. Its import or trade is banned in several countries like Australia and several EU countries. They have a tendency to displace native population due to their ability to multiply fast. They are also restricted due to their tendency to carry infections like Salmonella. <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong> The terrapin is a native of Mexico and Southern US. Due to their trade as a popular pet, the reptile has spread its territory to many parts of the world including south-east Asia. It is illegal to own these terrapins as pets in India."
