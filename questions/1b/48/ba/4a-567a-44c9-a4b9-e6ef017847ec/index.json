  "question": "Who among the following gave the Uncertainity principle?",
  "option1": "R.A Milkman",
  "option2": "Ernset Rutherford",
  "option3": "S.N Bose",
  "option4": "Werner Heisenberg",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Werner Heisenberg",
  "explanation": "Werner Heisenberg, a german Physicist, discovered the Uncertainity principle. As per the uncertainty principle, we cannot measure the position (x) and the momentum (p) of a particle with absolute precision. The more accurately we know one of these values, the less accurately we know the other. It represnts the effects of wave-particle duality on the properties of subatomic objects."
