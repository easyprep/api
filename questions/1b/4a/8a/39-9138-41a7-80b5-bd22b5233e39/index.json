  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "In the mid of the 17th century, there were 8000 Mansabdars out of which less than 500 controlled more than 60% of the revenue , so there was a mutual jealsey among the aristocrats. In 18th century, there was not enough surplus to pay for cost of administration and wars. The area which was to be distributed as Jagirs remained constant and even decreased but the number of Masabdars increased drastically, giving a condition that “Too many mansabdars chased a few Jagirs”. Many of these Jagirdars were left without their Jagirs too and that is why there was a general sense of insecurity among these aristocrats."
