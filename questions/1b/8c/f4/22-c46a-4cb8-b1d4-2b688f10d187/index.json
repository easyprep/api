  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Shifting cultivation is a temporary type of farming where clearings in the forest are done to grow food. When the soil is no more fertile after two to three years of cultivation, the cultivators abandon the field to look for another suitable plot of land. The first field is left to fallow, or rest and they begin the cycle of activities on a new plot of land. The cultivators may return to the same plot of land after 20 to 30 years.</span>"
