  "question": "Consider the following statements about the Unnat Bharat Abhiyan: <ol> <li>It is an initiative by the Ministry of Finance</li> <li>It aims to promote entrepreneurship amongst the economically weaker section of the society</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because Unnat Bharat Abhiyan is an initiative by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) and not under the Ministry of Finance. <u>Second statement is also incorrect</u>. The Unnat Bharat Abhiyan has nothing to do with entrepreneurship. In fact, the scheme aims to connect institutions of Higher Education with local communities to address the development challenges through application of technologies. Under this scheme, the representatives of Higher Education Institutions will interact with local bodies and community in selected village clusters and provide knowledge inputs into the Gram Panchayat Development Plans."
