  "question": "A bar magnet, tied in the middle with a thread, was suspended at the North Pole. It would be stable in __:",
  "option1": "Vertical position with its south pole downward",
  "option2": "Vertical position with its north pole downward",
  "option3": "Nearly vertical position with its south pole downward",
  "option4": "Nearly vertical position with its north pole downward",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Nearly vertical position with its north pole downward",
  "explanation": "A bar magnet points north south direction when tied in the middle with a thread because the north pole of the magnet inside it is attracted to the south pole of Earth's built-in magnet and vice versa. As the Earth's magnetic field lines are not parallel to the surface, so it creates nearly vertical position with its north pole downward."
