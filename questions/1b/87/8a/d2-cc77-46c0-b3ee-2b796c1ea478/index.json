  "answer": "Georgia",
  "explanation": "Georgia's intangible cultural heritage is \"Kvevri and the tradition of wine-making\". Kvevri is large earthenware vessels used for the fermentation, storage and ageing of traditional Georgian wine. Resembling large, egg-shaped amphorae without handles, they are either buried below ground or set into the floors of large wine cellars. \"Kvevri and the tradition of wine-making in kvevri\" was inscribed on the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Georgia registry in 2011. In 2013, UNESCO added the traditional Georgian method of making wine in kvevris to its list of intangible cultural heritage."
