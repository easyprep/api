  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Atacama",
  "explanation": "This desert is blocked from moisture on both sides by the Andes mountains and by the Chilean Coast Range. A coastal inversion layer created by the cold Humboldt Current and the anticyclone of the Pacific is essential to keeping the climate of the Atacama dry. Some parts of this desert have never received any rain."
