  "question": "Consider the following: \r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Sodium </li>\r\n<li>Potassium </li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above plays vital role in restoring the body fluid?",
  "option1": "1 only",
  "option2": "2 only",
  "option3": "Both 1& 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1& 2",
  "explanation": "Potassium and sodium are electrolytes needed for the body to function normally and help maintain fluid and blood volume in the body. To restore balance, the sodium-potassium pump transfers sodium back to the extracellular fluid and water follows. Every cycle of the sodium-potassium pump involves the movement of three sodium ions out of a cell, in exchange for two potassium ions into a cell."
