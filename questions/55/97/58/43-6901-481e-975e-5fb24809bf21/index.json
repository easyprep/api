  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "All the crops given in the question are pulses. Pulses are important food crops due to their high protein and essential amino acid content. Like many leguminous crops, pulses play a key role in crop rotation due to their ability to fix nitrogen. To support the awareness on this matter, the United Nations general assembly had declared 2016 as the “International Year of Pulses”. The move is to raise the awareness of pulses globally and the important role pulses can play in advancing health and nutrition, food security and environmental sustainability."
