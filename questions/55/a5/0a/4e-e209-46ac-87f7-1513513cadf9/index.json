  "option1": "Turkey",
  "option2": "Israel",

  "answer": "Greece",
  "explanation": "Konstantinos Mitsotakis (98), the former conservative Prime Minister of Greece, has recently passed away in Athens, Greece on May 29, 2017.  He will be remembered for fierce confrontations with Greece\\'s liberal and socialist parties as well as early free-market reforms during a 60-year political career. He was credited with starting unpopular free-market policies, which were quietly continued by later governments, and with improving relations with Turkey. But he was often considered a divisive figure in a country struggling to escape its volatile political history."
