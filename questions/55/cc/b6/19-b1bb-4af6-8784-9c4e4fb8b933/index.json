Consider the following statements with regards to anthrax:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Cutaneous anthrax can spread through inhalation.</li>\n<li>Anthrax is a viral disease.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",

  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nCutaneous Anthrax spreads through skin – when the anthrax spores get into the cuts and scrapes. The Anthrax can spread in three forms. While the Cutaneous anthrax spreads through skin, the pulmonary anthrax spreads through inhalation and the gastrointestinal anthrax spreads through stomach when the affected animal’s meat is consumed.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nAnthrax is a bacterial disease. It is an infectious disease caused by gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria known as Bacillus anthracis. This bacterium is naturally found in the soil. It commonly affects the animals. Anthrax is not contagious. However, a contact with this microbe can cause severe illness to both the humans and the animals."
