  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Some people broadly divide the geographical land area of India into three parts viz. Deccan trap, Gondwana and Vindhyan. The Deccan Trap covers almost all of Maharashtra, some parts of Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and marginally Andhra Pradesh. Deccan Trap is thought to have formed as result of sub-aerial volcanic activity associated with the continental deviation in this part of the Earth during the Mesozoic era. This implies that generally, the rocks of Deccan Trap are igneous."
