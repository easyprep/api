  "option1": "Jammu & Kashmir",
  "option2": "Maharashtra",
  "option3": "Odisha",
  "option4": "Mizoram",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Mizoram",
  "explanation": "BRU tribes were earlier found predominantly in Tripura. However, the community people were not treated well by the then Tripura Raja and most of them were forced to flee to the deep forest not only in the hill areas of Tripura but also in the adjoining areas of Mizoram. This migration from Tripura to Mizoram continued for a longer period of time and now this tribe is predominantly found in Mizoram. Recently, the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) launched a “Special Project” as a component of the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) for skilling BRU Tribes."
