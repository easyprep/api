  "question": "A recent study was conducted to profile human traffickers in West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Andhra Pradesh accounts for the largest percentage of human trafficking in India.</li>\n<li>In most cases, the trafficking is done by the victim’s relative.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nWest Bengal accounts for the largest percentage of human trafficking done in India. The 2016 records from National Crime Record Bureau say that 44% of the cases were from the eastern state. The study found that 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the traffickers were women.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe study found that the largest percentage of the traffickers were neighbours or acquaintances of the victims. This accounts for 34%. The next largest section (comprising 31%) of the traffickers was strangers to the victims. In contrast to common belief, a very small portion of the trafficking is done by relatives of the victims."
