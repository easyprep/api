  "question": "What are the significances of a practical approach to sugarcane production known as ‘Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative’?<br> 1. Input cost very low in this compared to the conventional method of cultivation.<br> 2. Drip irrigation can be practiced very effectively in this.<br> 3. There is no application of chemical/ inorganic fertilizers at all in this.<br> 4. The scope for intercropping is more in this compared to the conventional method of cultivation.<br> Select the correct option from the codes given below:",

  "option2": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "option3": "Only 1, 2 & 4",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1, 2 & 4",
  "explanation": "Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative is all about cultivating sugarcane mainly by changing the way the inputs and methods are used. It involves less use of seeds; less user of water and optimum utilization of fertilizers and land; so that more yields is obtained with minimum use of inputs. Its basic premise is to obtain “more with less” in agriculture. By changing the way of raising nursery, it brings down the cost up to 75%. It reduces plant mortality rate; helps in increasing the length and weight of cane. However, SSI is farmer driven method; and its advantages are dependent on the efforts of cultivator himself rather."
