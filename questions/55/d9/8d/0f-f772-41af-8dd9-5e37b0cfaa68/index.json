  "question": "With reference to the India-Australia dialogue on energy and resources, consider the following statements about coal, a major Australian export to India:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>India is the largest importer of coking coal.</li>\n<li>Australian coking coal is considered as the industrial benchmark.</li>\n<li>Demand for metallurgical coal is dependent on demand for steel.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nCoking coal is the type of coal used for producing coke, a form of carbon. China is currently the largest importer of coking coal. India is expected to become the largest importer by 2022 as it imports about 85% of its needs.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nAustralia is a major exporter of coking coal. There are 3 types of coking coal: hard coking coal (HCC), semi-soft coking coal and pulverised coal injection variety. The Australian HCC has better coking capacity than the other varieties and is considered the benchmark.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nCoking coal is also called metallurgical coal. It is different from thermal coal, which is used to produce heat and energy. Coking coal is used as a carbon source for making steel. Because of this, the demand for coking coal is dictated by the demand for steel."
