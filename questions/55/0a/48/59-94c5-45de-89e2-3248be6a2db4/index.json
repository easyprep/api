  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about the soil chemistry?<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>High pH values indicate an acidic soil.</li>\r\n<li>A low pH indicates alkaline conditions.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "An important aspect of soil chemistry is acidity, alkalinity (baseness), or neutrality.<br />Low pH values indicate an acidic soil, and a high pH indicates alkaline conditions. Most complex plants grow only in the soils with levels between pH 4 and pH 10 but optimum pH varies with the plant species."
