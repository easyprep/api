  "explanation": "Sukharanjan Sengupta (85), the veteran journalist, has passed away in Kolkata, West Bengal on December 9, 2017. He had worked for Bengali dailies \\'Jugantar\\' and \\'Ananda Bazar Patrika\\' in his long career spanning over six decades. Sengupta extensively covered the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1970-71. He came to the limelight after managing to sneak into Marichjhapi, a reserved island in the Sundarbans, on the eve of a state crackdown on migrant settlers in 1979 and filing reports about the state-sponsored cruelty. Despite age, Sengupta never gave up on his journalism and continued to freelance for several Bengali newspapers even years after his official retirement. He has authored several books, mostly in Bengali."
