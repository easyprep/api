  "question": "The researchers at which institute have developed cheaper organic solar cells using vitamin B12 derivative?",
  "option1": "IISER Pune",
  "option2": "IIITM Gwalior",
  "option3": "IISER Bhopal",
  "option4": "IISc Bangalore",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "IISER Bhopal",
  "explanation": "The researchers at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Bhopal have developed cheaper and more flexible organic solar cells using a synthetic derivative of vitamin B12. An organic solar cell is made up of acceptor and donor materials. The donor absorbs light from solar radiation and the harvested energy is passed to the electrodes with the help of the acceptor. In the present study, the researchers synthesized the donor using an artificial aromatic chemical (corrole) which has a similar structure to the corrin ring in vitamin B12. The artificially synthesised corrole (Cor-BODIPY) absorbs light much like porphyrin in natural chlorophyll. Currently, corroles are used as sensors, catalysts and in biomedical imaging. This is the first study wherein a corrole has been utilised for a bulk heterojunction solar cell as a donor material."
