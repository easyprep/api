  "question": "The researchers of which country have developed a new automated non-invasive technique for diagnosing eye surface cancer?",
  "option1": "India",
  "option2": "Australia",
  "option3": "Japan",
  "option4": "China",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Australia",
  "explanation": "Australian researchers, at the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Nanoscale BioPhotonics, have developed a new automated non-invasive technique for diagnosing eye surface cancer. The novel technique involves custom-building of an advanced imaging microscope linked with computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) operations. It results in an automated system that is able to successfully identify between diseased and non-diseased eye tissue, in real-time, through a simple scanning process. The new technique scans natural light given off by specific eye cells -- diseased cells -- that have their own unique \\'light-wave signature\\'. This new technique offers the potential to reduce the need for biopsies, prevent therapy delays, and make treatment far more effective for patients. Eye surface cancer, also known as Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia (OSSN), is a common malignancy of the cornea and conjunctiva parts of the eye."
