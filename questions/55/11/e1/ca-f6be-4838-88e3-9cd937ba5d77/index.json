In 1884, Cameroon became a German colony. After World War I France and United Kingdom had an agreement allowing France to take control of Cameroon. Freedom struggle against French colonization leads to the Bamileke War between French forces and Cameroonian nationalists. Finally, in 1960, the French-administered part of Cameroon became independent."
