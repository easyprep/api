  "question": "Which of the following fertilisers leaves acidic residue?",
  "option1": "Ammonium phosphate",
  "option2": "Ammonium sulphate",
  "option3": "Urea",
  "option4": "Sulphate of potash",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Sulphate of potash",
  "explanation": "K+ is an unreactive ion as it produced from the dissolution of the weak base KOH. However, SO42- is produced from the dissociation of strong acid HSO4- so it is slightly acidic. So the product K2SO4 would be slightly acidic."
