  "question": "Marayoor Jaggery, which recently got the GI Tag, is associated to which of the following states?",
  "option1": "Kerala",
  "option2": "Odisha",
  "option3": "Karnataka",
  "option4": "Tamil Nadu",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Kerala",
  "explanation": "The traditional and handmade ‘Marayoor Jaggery’ from Idukki district of Kerala has finally got the Geographical Indication (GI) tag that makes it safe for consumption while rejuvenating the traditional way of production and ensuring a safe market in future. It has been a long-term demand of farmers in Marayur and Kanthallur grama panchayats, where jaggery is produced without adding any chemicals. Though the Marayur jaggery has always been known for its high quality, fake jaggery with a salty taste was being marketed as Marayur jaggery. Hence, The GI tag would aid in initiating legal action against fake jaggery being sold as Marayur jaggery. The dark brown Maryur jaggery is handmade at household units in Marayur and Kanthallur. It has high sweetness with less saltiness, high content of iron and less sodium. The produce is free of impurities and the sugar cane fields are free of chemical pesticides and fertilisers."
