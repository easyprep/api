  "option1": 0.075,
  "option2": 0.1,
  "option3": 0.08,
  "option4": 0.12,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 0.1,
  "explanation": "Price after 10% first discount = $latex 1000\\\\times \\\\frac{100-10}{100}&s=1$\r\n$latex => 1000\\\\times \\\\frac{90}{100} = 900 Rs.&s=1$\r\nPrice after second discount = 810 Rs.  (Given)\r\n∴ Second discount = 900 - 810 = 90 Rs. \r\n∴ Percentage of second discount = $latex \\\\frac{90\\\\times 100}{900} = 10\\\\%&s=1$\r\nHence option [B] is the right answer."
