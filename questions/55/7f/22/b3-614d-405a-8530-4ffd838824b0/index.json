  "option2": "orographic precipitation",
  "option3": "cold ocean currents",
  "option4": "subtropical high pressure",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "cold ocean currents",
  "explanation": "Cold ocean currents contribute to the formation of coastal deserts. Cold ocean currents contribute to the formation of coastal deserts. Air blowing toward shore, chilled by contact with cold water, produces a layer of fog. This heavy fog drifts onto land. Although humidity is high, the atmospheric changes that normally cause rainfall are not present. A coastal desert may be almost totally rainless, yet damp with fog.<br> The Atacama Desert, on the Pacific shores of Chile, is a coastal desert. Some areas of the Atacama are often covered by fog. But the region can go decades without rainfall. In fact, the Atacama Desert is the driest place on Earth. Some weather stations in the Atacama have never recorded a drop of rain.
