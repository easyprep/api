  "answer": "Raxaul",
  "explanation": "India will build a strategic railway link between Raxaul in Bihar and Kathmandu in Nepal to enhance people-to-people linkages and promote economic growth and development. Announcement in this regard was made on April 7, 2018, after delegation-level talks between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Nepalese counterpart K P Sharma Oli. Thus, a new electrified rail line connecting Raxaul to Nepal's Capital Kathmandu will be constructed and will be entirely financed by India. This railway line holds strategic significance as in March 2016, China had agreed to construct a railway link with Nepal through Tibet, aimed at reducing Kathmandu's dependence on India.",
