  "explanation": "Iceland houses the geyser \"Strokkur\". Strokkur is a fountain-type geyser located in a geothermal area beside the Hvita River in Iceland in the southwest part of the country, east of Reykjavik. Strokkur and its surrounding areas regularly attract tourists hoping to see the geyser erupt, as it is one of the very few natural geysers to erupt frequently and reliably.",
