  "question": "Which of the following orbital will be filled first among two orbitals?",
  "option1": "Orbital with higher value of (n+l)",
  "option2": "Orbital with lower value of (n+l)",
  "option3": "Orbital with lower value of (n)",
  "option4": "Orbital with lower value of (l)",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Orbital with lower value of (n+l)",
  "explanation": "The rule for orbital filling states that the orbitals with lower value of (n+l) are filled first as they have lower energy."
