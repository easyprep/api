WAYU is developed by Council of Scientific and Industrial Research â€“National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-NEERI) to mitigate air pollution at traffic junctions.  The prototype device has the capacity to purify air in an area of 500 meter square. It consumes only half a unit of electricity for 10 hours of running and has a maintenance cost of only Rs. 1500 per month.  Along with particulate matter, the device will remove poisonous gases such as volatile organic compounds and carbon monoxide. This device works on two principles mainly wind generation for dilution of air pollutants and active pollutants removal."
