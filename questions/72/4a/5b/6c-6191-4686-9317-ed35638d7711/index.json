  "question": "Which country has appointed Hana Khatib as first female judge in its Muslim sharia court system?",
  "option1": "Iran",
  "option2": "Israel",
  "option3": "Palestine",
  "option4": "Iraq",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Israel",
  "explanation": "Israel has recently appointed Hana Khatib as first female judge in its Muslim sharia court system.  Hana Khatib, an attorney from the northern town of Tamra, was selected by an Israeli justice committee to become a religious judge, or qadi, in the courtâ€™s ruling on personal law for Muslims inside Israel.  Khatib is the first woman not only for the Muslim sharia courts but also for all the religious courts in Israel, as no women serve as judges in the Jewish or Druze courts. Because of this, her appointment is a precedent for Israel. Khatib will be sworn in by Israeli President Reuven Rivlin in a few weeks."
