  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Rubber is a common viscoelastic material which means it is both viscous and elastic. Further, Rubber is also characterized by another property called resilience. Resilience is the ability of a material to absorb energy when it is deformed elastically, and release that energy upon unloading. Higher the resilience, higher is the bounce in a rubber ball, which means higher elasticity and lesser viscosity. We note here that the butadiene rubber has higher resilience property, followed by natural rubber."
