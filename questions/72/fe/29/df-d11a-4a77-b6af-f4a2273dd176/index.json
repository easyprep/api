  "question": "Which of the following National parks has become the largest habitat of the endangered estuarine crocodiles in India?",
  "option1": "Jim Corbett National Park",
  "option2": "Bhitarkanika National Park",
  "option3": "Ranthambore National Park",
  "option4": "Nagarhole National Park",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Bhitarkanika National Park",
  "explanation": "The Bhitarkanika National Park (BNP) of Odisha has become the largest habitat of the endangered estuarine crocodiles in India with a record number of their nesting sites spotted in it. Recently, the enumerators have spotted 101 nests of crocodile in Kanika, Gahirmatha, Mahakalapada and Rajnagar wildlife forest range divisions under the park. As per the January 2018 crocodile census report, the water bodies of Bhitarkanika are home to 1,698 saltwater crocodiles. Estuarine crocodiles are also found in West Bengal\\'s Sundarban areas having the country\\'s largest mangrove cover. Besides, the mangrove wetlands in Andaman Islands are home to these species, but those cannot match the density and population of crocodile available in the wild habitats of Bhitarkanik National Park (BNP)."
