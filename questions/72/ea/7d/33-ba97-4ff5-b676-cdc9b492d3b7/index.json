  "question": "Consider the following statements: <br />A 4-wheel vehicle moving a sharp circular path at high speed will<br />1. Overturn about its outer wheels<br />2. Overturn about its inner wheels<br />3. Skid outwards<br />4. Skid inwards<br />Which of these statements are correct?",
  "option1": "1 and 3",
  "option2": "2 and 4",
  "option3": "2 and 3",
  "option4": "1 and 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 and 3",
  "explanation": "In case of object moving along a circular path two types of forces centripetal and centrifugal acts upon it. As they have opposite impact thus, the object remains in balance. When centrifugal force gets disturbed then the object will leave the balance and skid toward an outward direction."
