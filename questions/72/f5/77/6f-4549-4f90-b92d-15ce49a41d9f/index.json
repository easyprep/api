  "explanation": "In a unique initiative, the Ambikapur municipal corporation of Chhattisgarh will soon open India’s first \\'Garbage Cafe\\' in the city of Ambikapur. This initiative is a step towards making the city plastic-free.   In this unique Cafe\\' poor people and rag pickers will get free food in exchange for 1Kg of plastic, while breakfast will be provided if half a kilogram of plastic is brought to the cafe. The collected garbage will be sold at Solid Liquid Resources Management Centre (SLRMC). The collected plastic waste would further be turned into granules and will then be used in the construction of roads in the city. Ambikapur is Chhattisgarh’s first dustbin-free city. The city has an efficient solid waste management system. The Self Help Groups (SHGs)of women are involved in door to door collection of waste. The city has been hailed as the 2nd cleanest city in the country in Swachhata rankings. The opening of this garbage cafe is another step towards the city’s aim to become free from plastic waste."
