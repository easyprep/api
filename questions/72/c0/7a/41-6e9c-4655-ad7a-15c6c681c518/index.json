  "question": "&nbsp; &nbsp;Consider the following pollutants: <ol> <li>Sulphur dioxide</li> <li>Nitrogen dioxide</li> <li>Volatile organic compounds&nbsp;(VOCs)</li> </ol> &nbsp;Which of the above is/are mainly responsible for acid rain?",
  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "1 Only",
  "option3": "3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 & 2 Only",
  "explanation": "Acid rain results when sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>X</sub>) are emitted into the atmosphere and transported by wind and air currents. &nbsp;The SO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;and NO<sub>X</sub>&nbsp;react with water, oxygen and other chemicals to form sulphuric and nitric acids. These then mix with water before falling to the ground."
