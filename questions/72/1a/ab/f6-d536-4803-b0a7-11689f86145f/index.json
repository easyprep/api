  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Lord Cornwallis",
  "explanation": "In order to consolidate the British rule in India, the civil services were reformed, modernised and rationalised by Lord <br />Cornwallis and hence, he is known as the “Father of Indian Civil Service”. The basic principle was the separation of revenue administration from the judicial administration. The Collector was diprived of judicial and magisterial powers, he became only the head of revenue administration. The posts of district judges were created to look after judicial administration. He reserved all the convenanted services for Britishers and excluded Indians from superior posts. Due to doubtfulness about the integrity and ability of Indians, he introduced this policy."
