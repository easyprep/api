  "question": "September 10 is observed as the World Suicide Prevention Day. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Low income countries exhibit the highest suicide rate according to WHO.</li>\n<li>The inequality between the suicide rates of men and women is higher in low income countries.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe international body reports that the suicide rate is highest among the high income countries. This is despite the fact that about 79% of suicides across the world occur in low and middle income countries. The high income countries have an average suicide rate of 11.5 per 100,000.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nWHO reported that the difference between the suicide rates of men and women is higher in high income countries. Three times as many men commit suicide than women in these countries. In low and middle income countries the gender gap is much lesser.\n&nbsp;"
