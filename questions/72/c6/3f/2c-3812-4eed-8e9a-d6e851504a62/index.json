  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "The Minimum Support Prices were announced by the Government of India for the first time in 1966-67 for Wheat in the wake of the Green Revolution and extended harvest, to save the farmers from depleting profits. Since then, the MSP regime has been expanded to many crops. Minimum Support Price is the price at which government purchases crops from the farmers, whatever may be the price for the crops. The MSP is announced by the Government of India for different crops currently at the beginning of each season viz. Rabi and Kharif.<br />In this question, second statement is incorrect because protection of farmers is primary objective. Third statement is incorrect because it protects from price fall only when they have bumper harvest. For crops failure, they need insurance. Fourth statement is also incorrect because MSP increases fiscal deficit."
