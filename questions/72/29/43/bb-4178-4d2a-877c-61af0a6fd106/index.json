Unlike every year, this year (2019) there is no specific theme but the day aims to draw attention towards maternal health. This year, the day calls for global attention to the unfinished business of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development. The landmark conference was attended by 179 governments who recognized that reproductive health and gender equality are essential for achieving sustainable development."
