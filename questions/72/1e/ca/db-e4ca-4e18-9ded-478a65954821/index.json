  "question": "&nbsp; Consider the following statements: <ol> <li>The majority of meteorites&nbsp;to the earth come from asteroid&nbsp;belt located&nbsp;between&nbsp;Mars and Jupiter&nbsp;</li> <li>Meteors&nbsp;burn&nbsp;up in the&nbsp;mesosphere</li> </ol> &nbsp; Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Both are correct statements<br> Most of the asteroids in our solar system can be found between the orbits of&nbsp;Mars&nbsp;and Jupiter.&nbsp;The majority of meteorites&nbsp;to the earth come from asteroid&nbsp;belt located&nbsp;between&nbsp;Mars and Jupiter.&nbsp;When a meteoroid enters the mesosphere, it encounters the molecules present in the mesosphere and rubs up against them. The heat generated by frictional rubbing burns the meteors."
