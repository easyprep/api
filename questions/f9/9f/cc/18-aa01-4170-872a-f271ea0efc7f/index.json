  "question": "With reference to the intense haze enveloping southeast Asia, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The September haze was caused by the Amazonian forest fires.</li>\n<li>Slash and burn cultivation is a cause of the Southeast Asiaâ€™s haze.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe September haze was caused by fires in Indonesia. The haze had spread across several countries including Singapore and Malaysia apart from Indonesia itself. This is an annual phenomenon. The case shows the globalisation of such environmental issues. The government had asked its citizens to stay indoors and take protective measures because of the intensity of the haze.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nSlash and burn cultivation is practiced in Indonesia. The September haze was blamed on the burning done for its palm oil plantations and cultivations for its pulpwood industries. This is also practiced in India, where it is called Jhumming. The haze had attained hazardous levels this year.\n&nbsp;"
