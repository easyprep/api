  "question": "Which of the following gas is used for artificial ripening of green fruits?",
  "option1": "Carbon dioxide",
  "option2": "Ethane",
  "option3": "Hydrogen",
  "option4": "acetylene (ethyne)",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "acetylene (ethyne)",
  "explanation": "Calcium carbide is also used in some countries for artificially ripening fruit. When calcium carbide comes in contact with moisture, it produces acetylene gas, which is quite similar in its effects to the natural ripening agent, ethylene. Acetylene acts like ethylene and accelerates the ripening process."
