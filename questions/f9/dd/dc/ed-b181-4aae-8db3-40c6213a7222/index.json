  "question": "In light of IMF highlighting the significance of oil deposits in South America, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The Orinoco Belt is in Guyana.</li>\n<li>The Stabroek exploration block is in the Atlantic Ocean.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Orinoco Belt is in Venezuela. The region has some of the largest oil deposits in the world. It lies south of the Orinoco River basin. It stretches for 600km from west to east. The deposits are of extra heavy crude.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Stabroek exploration block lies in the Atlantic Ocean, offshore of Guyana. It was discovered in 2015. Because of the discovery, it is expected that Guyana will be the country that produces the most crude per citizen. IMF also predicts that the country will be the fastest growing in 2020 with oil forming about 40% of its economy.\n&nbsp;"
