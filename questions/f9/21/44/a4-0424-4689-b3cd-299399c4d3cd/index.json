  "question": "Which among the following is/are primary forces which influence the ocean currents?<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Salinity difference</li>\r\n<li>Heating by solar energy</li>\r\n<li>Wind</li>\r\n<li>Gravity</li>\r\n<li>Coriolis Force</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1, 2 & 4",
  "option2": "2, 3, 4 & 5",
  "option3": "1, 2, 3 & 5",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3, 4 & 5",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2, 3, 4 & 5",
  "explanation": "Ocean currents are influenced by two types of forces namely:<br />primary forces that initiate the movement of water - heating by solar energy, wind, gravity and Coriolis force.<br />secondary forces that influence the currents to flow - Temperature difference, Salinity difference."
