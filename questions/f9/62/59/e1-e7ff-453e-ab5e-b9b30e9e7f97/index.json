  "question": "Recently, Scientists have discovered rare, living specimens of stromatolites, which provide information about the oldest evidence of life on Earth. These specimens of stromatolites have been discovered in which country?",
  "option1": "South Africa",
  "option2": "Brazil",
  "option3": "Australia",
  "option4": "China",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Australia",
  "explanation": "Stromatolites are laminated structures of micro- organisms which have created layers of minerals using elements dissolved in the water in which they live. The discovery of living stromatolites in Tasmania, Australia is highly significant because stromatolites are rare globally and not previously known from Tasmania except as ancient fossils. The DNA analysis indicates that the Tasmanian stromatolites are micro-organism communities which differ from all other known stromatolites."
