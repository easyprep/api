  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "In the budget speech (2017-18), the Finance Minister announced for setting up of “Mahila Shakti Kendra”. The MSK is meant to provide “one-stop convergent support services for empowering rural women with opportunities for skill development, employment, digital literacy, health and nutrition”. Mahila Shakti Kendra (MSK) is a sub-scheme under the Umbrella Scheme Pradhan Mantri Mahila ShashaktikaranYojana (PMMSY). The new scheme MSK is envisaged to work at the National level, State level, District and at the Block level. Under this scheme, student volunteers will cater to awareness about government schemes/programs, training and capacity building for the empowerment of rural women through block-level intervention. They will provide an interface for rural women to approach the government for availing their entitlements. At the state level, the State Resource Centre for Women (SRCW) set up will provide technical assistance to women for effective implementation of the social programmes. At District Level, a new component namely District Level Centre for Women (DLCW) has been envisaged which will collate information on government programmes, schemes and services meant for women empowerment. Each DLCW will be manned by 3 persons. At block level, the MSK will be implemented at the Gram Panchayat level."
