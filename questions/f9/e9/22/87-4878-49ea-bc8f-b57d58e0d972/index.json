  "question": "Which protein has recently found to be responsible for increasing insulin action in obesity-induced diabetes?",
  "option1": "Fibrous",
  "option2": "Keratin",
  "option3": "Collagen",
  "option4": "Secretagogin",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Secretagogin",
  "explanation": "Scientists at the CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) in Hyderabad have demonstrated the role of a protein secretagogin (SCGN) in increasing insulin action in obesity-induced diabetes. <br />SCGN works as a functional insulin-binding protein with therapeutic potential against diabetes. SCGN binds to insulin and protects it from various stresses, increases its stability and adds to its action.Diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease are often linked with each other. SCGN is found in lower quantities in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients."
