  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The CPEC is part of China’s one belt one road initiative. India is strongly objecting to the CPEC since it is passing through the disputed region of PoK. Hence Statements 1 and 2 are correct. CPEC connects Gwadar port with Kashgar of China. Kunming is part of the BCIM corridor which connects India (Kolkata) and china (Kunming) via Bangladesh (Dhaka) and Myanmar (Mandalay). Thus, statement 2 is incorrect"
