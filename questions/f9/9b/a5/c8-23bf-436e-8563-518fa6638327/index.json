  "question": "Which of the following is / are consequences of deforestation? \r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Reduction in atmospheric moisture</li>\r\n<li>Increase in emission of carbon dioxide</li>\r\n<li>Increase in thickness of  ice sheets on earth</li>\r\n<li>Slope stabilization</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes give below:",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 4 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 & 2 Only",
  "explanation": "Deforestation leads to increase in green house gases on earth and thus increase in temperature of earth surface. This in turn leads to melting of ice and reduction in size of ice-sheets on earth. Slope stabilization reduces due to increase in erosion activities by wind, water etc. after deforestation."
