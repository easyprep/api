  "explanation": "Akbar established Ibadat Khana at Fatehpur Sikri in 1575. It was for the purpose of conducting religious discussions and debates. Akbar promulgated Mazharnama in order to take all religious matter into his own hands. &nbsp;Duaspa and Sihaspa literally mean troopers with 2-3 horses. This rank was introduced by Jahangir and was allotted to those Mansabdars engaged in military operations and expeditions."
