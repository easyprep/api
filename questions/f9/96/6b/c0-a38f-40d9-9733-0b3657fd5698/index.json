  "answer": "Lakshadweep",
  "explanation": "The Union territory of Lakshadweep joined UDAY (Scheme Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana) Scheme. This will ensure operational turnaround of Lakshadweep's Electricity Department. Lakshadweep will receive an overall net benefit of around Rs. 8 crore through the UDAY Scheme. This will be achieved by cheaper funds, reduction in AT&C (Aggregate Technical and Commercial) losses, interventions in energy efficiency, etc. The Central Government will help Lakshadweep in improving Power infrastructure which will result in further reduction of the cost of power.",
