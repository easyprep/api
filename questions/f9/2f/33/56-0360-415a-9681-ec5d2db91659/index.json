The countries where Pagoda style monuments can be found are Nepal, India, China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Burma and other parts of Asia. The origin of Pagoda style is from India and Nepal. The style originated via the stupas. The most famous Pagoda style temple is the Pashupatinath temple, a 5th-century shrine dedicated to Lord Shiva in Nepal. The pagoda-style temple has been in its current form since 1640, built by King Bhupatindra Malla. The shrine attracts lakhs of pilgrims every year. Legend says that Adi Shankaracharya sent priests to this temple. Recorded history confirms that South Indian priests have been heading the shrine without break since the 10th century. In India, the famous example is the Global Vipassana Pagoda in Gorai area of Mumbai, India. The Pagodas found in East Asia are different from those found in South East Asia."
