  "question": "A can do a piece of work in 4 hours, B and C can do it in 3 hours. A and C can do it in 2 hours. How long will B alone take to do it?",
  "option1": "8 hours",
  "option2": "24 hours",
  "option3": "10 hours",
  "option4": "12 hours",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "12 hours",
  "explanation": "A\\'s one hour\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{4}&s=1$\r\n(B + C)\\'s one hour\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{3}&s=1$\r\n(A + C)\\'s one hour\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{2}&s=1$\r\nâˆ´ C\\'s one hour\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{2}-\\\\frac{1}{4} = \\\\frac{2-1}{4} = \\\\frac{1}{4}&s=1$\r\nB\\'s one hour\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{3}-\\\\frac{1}{4} = \\\\frac{4-3}{12} = \\\\frac{1}{12}&s=1$\r\nHence B alone can do the work in 12 hours, so option [D] is correct answer"
