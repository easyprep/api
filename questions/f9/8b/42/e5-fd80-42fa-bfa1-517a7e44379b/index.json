  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "<p class=\\\"Explanation\\\">Even though it is cleaner than coal and oil, it still contributes a large amount of carbon dioxide to greenhouse gases. By itself natural gas is mostly methane, which is 21 times more dangerous for greenhouse warming than carbon dioxide so any leakage of the gas (from animals, landfills, melting tundra, etc) contributes strongly to greenhouse emissions."
