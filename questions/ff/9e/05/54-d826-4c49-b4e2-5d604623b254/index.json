  "question": "Over the next decade, India plans to spend over a billion dollars to develop deep sea technology to cater to its deep sea mining ambitions. Consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>Deep sea mining is monitored by International Seabed Authority.</li>\n<li>China accounts for most licenses held for deep sea mining.</li>\n<li>Scaly foot snail is the first species to be officially declared threatened due to deep sea mining.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "None of the above",
  "option3": "All of the above",
  "option4": "1 and 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong> Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe International seabed authority is an inter-governmental agency charged with regulating mining activities in seas that are beyond the states’ jurisdiction. It was established under UN convention on the Law of the Sea. It has 167 members, apart from the EU countries. It gives licenses to states for exploration of area limited to 150,000 sq.km. After 8 years, half of the area is to be returned to ISA.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nChina holds 4 out of the 29 licences given out by ISA. The country controls more area in the deep seas for exploration than any other country. Furthermore, the country accounts for 90% rare earth elements production in the world. India has permission to explore an area of about 75,000 sq.km in the IOR.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe scaly foot snail was declared the first victim of deep sea mining in the IOR. It was added by the IUCN to its Red list- that holds the species that are endangered by various factors- especially anthropogenic in origin. The snail is found in hydrothermal vents of the sea bed. They are found at only 3 spots in the IOR."
