  "question": "Which of the following atomic nuclear power stations of India are using Pressurized heavy water reactor technology?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Kaiga</li>\r\n<li>Tarapur</li>\r\n<li>Narora</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Pressurized Heavy water reactor – It is nuclear reactor used for power generation. It uses Uranium as fuel. This uses heavy water as coolant and moderator. The heavy water enable reactor to operate without fuel enrichment facilities and thereby enhancing the reactor’s ability to efficiently use alternate fuel cycles.  Presently in India, Kaiga, Tarapur, Narora,  Kakrapar 1 and 2 are using Pressurized heavy water reactor technology.\r\n<strong>Kaiga in news</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Kaiga Atomic power station operationalized since 2000 in Kaiga district of Karnataka.</li>\r\n<li>Kaiga plant has 4 Units with 220 MW power generation capacity. It supplied its power to Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.</li>\r\n<li>It is an indigenous Pressurized Heavy water reactor which is fueled by domestic fuel Uranium.</li>\r\n<li>KGS – I is continuously working since 13<sup>th</sup> May 2016 and set a world record of uninterrupted operation of 941 days.</li>\r\n<li>The commercialized operation of Kaiga has been started from 16 November 2016.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEarlier KGS set national record for non-stop operation of 766 days.\r\nKGS – I break the record set by Heysham-2 of UK which is an Advanced Gas cooled reactor for continuous operation of 940 days."
