The title has been borrowed from the Hyderabad stylistâ€™s fabulous series-turning innings of 281 against Australia at the Eden Gardens in 2001. His partnership along with Rahul Dravid in that match is one of the best batting partnerships in cricket history. He was known for his patience and wrist work and scored many memorable centuries during his playing days. Laxman played 134 Tests, amassing 8,781 runs at an average of 45.97. He scored 17 centuries and 56 half centuries. He also played in 86 ODIs for an aggregate of 2338 and average of 30.76 in the shorter format."
