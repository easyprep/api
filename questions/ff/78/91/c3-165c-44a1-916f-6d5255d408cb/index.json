  "question": "It takes much longer to cook food in the hills than in the plains, because",
  "option1": "in the hills the atmospheric pressure is lower than that in the plains and therefore water boils at a temperature lower than 100oC causing an increase in cooking time",
  "option2": "due to low atmospheric pressure on the hills, the water boils at a temperature higher than 100oC and therefore water takes longer to boil",
  "option3": "in the hills the atmospheric density is low and therefore a lot of heat is lost to the atmosphere",
  "option4": "in the hills the humidity is high and therefore a lot of heat is absorbed by the atmosphere leaving very little heat for cooking",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "in the hills the atmospheric pressure is lower than that in the plains and therefore water boils at a temperature lower than 100oC causing an increase in cooking time",
  "explanation": "No answer description available for this question. Let us discuss.",
