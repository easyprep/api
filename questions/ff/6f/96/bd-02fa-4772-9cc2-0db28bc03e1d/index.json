  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "SHAKTI or Scheme for Harnessing and Allocating Koyla (coal) transparently proposes to do away with the discretionary element and introduce market-based pricing for Independent Power Producers (IPPs). Those IPPs that have already stitched up power purchase agreements (PPAs) will have to bid for coal supply on the basis of discount over the tariff. Those without PPAs will have to bid over the notified price of coal by the supplier, Coal India or Singareni Collieries. The scheme aims to reform the bureaucratic and often non-transparent process of coal allocation for power projects in the country."
