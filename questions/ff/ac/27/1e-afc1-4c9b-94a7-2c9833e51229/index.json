  "explanation": "Mingi is the traditional belief among the Omoti-speaking Karo and Hamar peoples of southern Ethiopia that children with perceived and true physical abnormalities are rituality impure. An example of perceived abnormalities includes the top teeth erupting before bottom teeth. Children born out of wedlock are also considered impure and therefore capable of bringing curses upon the people. The fear of curses or bad luck for the tribe leads to the killing of many children. After widespread criticism and international condemnation, Karo tribe officially banned the practice in 2012, but this tradition still remains active secretly in many parts of the community"
