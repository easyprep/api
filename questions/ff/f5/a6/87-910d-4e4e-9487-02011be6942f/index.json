  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is correct</u>. The scheme aims to provide an annual health care of Rs 5 Lakh per family to 10 crore families in the country. <u>Second statement is also correct</u>. Besides providing secondary and tertiary healthcare to individuals, the scheme also envisages providing 1.5 lakh wellness centres across the country for the primary health care of individuals. The AB-NHPM will subsume the on-going centrally sponsored schemes â€“Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) and the Senior Citizen Health Insurance Scheme (CHIS). The central government would ask the States/ UTs to implement the scheme by a dedicated entity called State Health Agency (SHA)."
