  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "During President&rsquo;s rule (Article 356), the executive power shifts from the council of ministers to the governor of the state. According to Article 356, President&rsquo;s rule can be imposed in a state if a situation has arisen in which the government of the state cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. Once President&rsquo;s rule is imposed, the assembly ceases to function and the state comes under the Central government&rsquo;s direct control.  The executive power shifts from the council of ministers to the governor. Once imposed, President&rsquo;s rule must be approved by Parliament within a period of two months. It can&rsquo;t last for more than six months unless its extension is approved by Parliament."
