  "question": "Consider the following characteristics of the Coral Reefs:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>They are found only in shallow-waters</li>\r\n<li>They are found only in tropical waters</li>\r\n<li>They are characterized by high biomass production</li>\r\n<li>They have remarkable floral and faunal diversity</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is/ are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "option3": "Only 1, 3 & 4",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "<strong>They are found only in shallow-waters<br /></strong>This statement is correct because Coral Reefs are found in shallow waters only. There are some deep water Corals too. But the problem is that not much is known whether the deep water corals make Coral reefs or not. Deep water coral can exist at greater depths and colder temperatures at much higher latitudes, as far north as Norway.<br /><strong>They are found only in tropical waters<br /></strong>This statement is incorrect. The Coral Reefs are found in tropical and temperate both kinds of waters but mostly available in 30°N to 30°S latitudes. Coral reefs are estimated to cover 284,300 km² or 0.1% of the oceans\\' surface area. The Indo-Pacific region (including the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia and the Pacific) account for 91.9% of this total. Southeast Asia accounts for 32.3% of that figure, while the Pacific including Australia accounts for 40.8%. Atlantic and Caribbean coral reefs account for 7.6%. The statement 3 &amp; 4 are correct and most remarkable features of these \\\"tropical rain forests\\' of the Oceans. <br /><strong>They are characterized by high biomass production<br /></strong>This is correct statement<br /><strong>They have remarkable floral and faunal diversity<br /></strong>This is also a correct statement."
