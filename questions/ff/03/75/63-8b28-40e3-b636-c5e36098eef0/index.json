The day also honours the sacrifices made by thousands of soldiers who fought against terrorism. It\\'s a day to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in terrorist attacks. It was on this day in 1991, the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by a suicide squad of Liberation of Tamil Tigers Eelam (LTTE), while attending a rally in Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu. The aim behind the observance of Anti-Terrorism Day is to wean away the people from terrorism and violence."
