  "answer": "Decrease the rate of setting of cement",
  "explanation": "Gypsum plays a very important role in controlling the rate of hardening of the cement. During the cement manufacturing process, upon the cooling of clinker, a small amount of gypsum is introduced during the final grinding process. Gypsum is added to control the setting of cement."
