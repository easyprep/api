  "question": "Consider the following statements: <ol> <li>Article 20 of Indian constitution guarantees Rights to life.</li> <li>Both active and passive euthanasia&nbsp;are illegal in India.</li> <li>Committing suicide is a crime in India.</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement</u> is incorrect because Article 21 of Indian constitution guarantees Rights to life. <u>Second statement</u> is incorrect because active euthanasia is illegal in India. But passive euthanasia&nbsp;is legal in India. On 7 March 2011 the&nbsp;Supreme Court of India legalised passive&nbsp;euthanasia&nbsp;by means of the withdrawal of&nbsp;life support&nbsp;to patients in a&nbsp;permanent vegetative state. <u>Third statement</u> is correct because in India abetment of suicide and attempt to suicide are both criminal offences. In 1994, constitutional validity of Indian Penal Code Section (IPC Sec) 309 was challenged in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court declared that IPC Sec 309 is unconstitutional, under Article 21 (Right to Life) of the constitution in a landmark judgement. Talks are going out to phase out section 309 of Indian Penal Code. (The Question is based on the fact that rate of suicides has been increasing in India for various reasons)"
