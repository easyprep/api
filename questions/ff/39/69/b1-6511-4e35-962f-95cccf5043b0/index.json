  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Dairy farming is a highly specialised activity requiring more labour than crop farming. Unlike crop farming, there is no off-season for a part of the year. The per capita consumption of dairy products in urban areas of Western Europe and North America is several times higher than in Asian countries. Therefore in spite of a high density of population in much of Asia the demand for dairy products is relatively limited."
