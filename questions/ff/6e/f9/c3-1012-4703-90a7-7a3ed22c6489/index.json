  "question": "Which of the following is / are correct observations about the terrestrial and ocean biodiversity?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be highest at low latitudes near the equator</li>\r\n<li>Terrestrial biodiversity is up to 25 times greater than ocean biodiversity</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be highest at low latitudes near the equator, mainly because of the warm climate and high primary productivity. The increase in species richness or biodiversity that occurs from the poles to the tropics, often referred to as the Latitudinal Diversity Gradient (LDG). Kindly note that Terrestrial biodiversity is up to 25 times greater than ocean biodiversity. fifth of the world&#8217;s marine species are crustaceans such as crabs, lobsters, krill and barnacles. Add molluscs (squid and octopus) and fish (including sharks) and that accounts for up to half the species in the seas. The charismatic species often used in conservation campaigning — whales, sea lions, turtles and sea birds — account for less than 2 per cent."
