  "question": "When one gene controls two or more different characters simultaneously, the phenomenon is known by which of the following names?",
  "option1": "Apomixis",
  "option2": "Pleiotropy",
  "option3": "Polyploidy",
  "option4": "Polyteny",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Pleiotropy",
  "explanation": "• Polyploidy occurs in cells and organisms when there are more than two paired (homologous) set of chromosome founds which controls more than one characters simultaneously. <br />• Apomixis is the process of asexual reproduction in which the embryo grows from egg cells without being fertilized. <br />• Pleiotropy occurs when a single gene influences multiple phenotypic traits. <br />• Polytene is a giant chromosome found in some two-winged flies."
