The company was granted the Diwani rights but the Nawab handed over all his administrative and military power (Nizamati) to the Diwan appointed by the company. This system was known as the system of dual government. The company had the Power without responsibility and the Nawab had the Responsibility without the power. This system was criticized as the masked system of Lord Clive. In the year 1772, Warren Hastings abolished the system of dual government."
