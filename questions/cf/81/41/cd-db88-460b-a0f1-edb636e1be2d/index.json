  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe Hindu Marriage Act, passed in 1955, applies to Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains apart from Hindus. It lays down the laws for divorce of marriages solemnised under this act. Recently, the Supreme Court made use of its powers to deliver ‘complete justice’ where the act didn’t provide for.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nIrretrievable breakdown of marriage is not grounds for divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act nor under the Special Marriage Act of 1954. However, the SC in December used it as grounds to provide divorce. Earlier the inclusion of ‘irretrievable breakdown of marriage’ as grounds for divorce was recommended twice by the Law Commission of India."
