  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "Extensive farming is done on large patches of land. The large swathes are able to output huge amount of produce but production per unit of land may be low. Such farming is done in those countries where large size of landholding is available e.g. United States, Canada etc. Extensive farming is almost absent in India except in some states such as Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The focus of intensive farming is to produce maximum output per unit of land. It is common in India as well as South East Asian countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia etc."
