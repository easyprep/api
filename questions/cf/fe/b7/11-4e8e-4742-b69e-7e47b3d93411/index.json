  "question": "The Centre for Science and Environment conducted a study on the fertiliser producing companies in India. Which of the following statements are correct?\n<ol>\n<li>The study found that biggest public sector units in the field are most compliant in terms of transparency in information sharing.</li>\n<li>India has some of the most energy efficient fertiliser plants in the world.</li>\n<li>Imbalance in nitrogen cycle is a major issue faced by the fertiliser industry.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 and 2",
  "option2": "None of the above",
  "option3": "2 and 3",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe study used over 50 parameters to evaluate the units. It found that 57% of the units studied volunteered information and allowed the on-site inspection. However, the largest units: National Fertilizers Limited and Indian Farmers’ Fertilizers Cooperative Limited didn’t participate voluntarily in the study. The best performance recorded was by the Indo-Gulf fertilizer Limited in UP. It received the Four Leaves award for superior performance.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe study found that Indian fertiliser manufacturing units are energy efficient and have low green-house gases emission. The units were found to have sufficient compliance to safety and health standards but were lacking in the disaster management aspect. The units suffered on the water use efficiency side. Many units are affected by water scarcity.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe two major issues faced by the sector on the environment aspect are nitrogen imbalance and climate change. India has very low nitrogen use efficiency. Most of the nitrogen is leached away and not available to the crops. Lowland rice crops have an efficiency of 35% while the upland crops have 50% efficiency."
