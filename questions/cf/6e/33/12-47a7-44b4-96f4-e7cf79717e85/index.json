  "question": "In what time will 1000 Rs. amounts to 1331 Rs. at 20% per annum, compounded half yearly?",
  "option1": "$latex 1\\ years$",
  "option2": "$latex 1\\frac{1}{2}\\ years&s=1$",
  "option3": "$latex 2\\ years$",
  "option4": "$latex 2\\frac{1}{2}\\ years&s=1$",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "$latex 1\\frac{1}{2}\\ years&s=1$",
  "explanation": "Let the required time be t years. Interest is compounded half yearly. \r\nâˆ´ Time = 2t half years and rate = 10%\r\n$latex \\\\therefore 1000\\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{10}{100} \\\\right )^{2t} = 1331&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\left ( \\\\frac{11}{10} \\\\right )^{2t} = \\\\frac{1331}{1000}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\left ( \\\\frac{11}{10} \\\\right )^{2t} = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{11}{10} \\\\right )^{3}&s=1$\r\n$latex => 2t = 3,\\\\ t = \\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\ years\\\\ or\\\\ 1\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ years&s=1$\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer."
