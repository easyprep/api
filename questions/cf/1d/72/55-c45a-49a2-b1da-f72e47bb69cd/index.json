He extended the invitation to Ambassador of Nepal to India Nilamber Acharya. The Geeta Jayanti falls on the Shukla Ekadashi of the waxing phase of Moon in the Hindu month of Margashirsha. It symbolizes the birth of Shrimad Bhagavad-Gita, the sacred text of the Hindus. The Geeta Jayanti Mahotsav possesses huge significance and importance as it is regarded as the birthday of Bhagavad-Gita which is considered as the most pious and influential scriptures of Hindu mythology. It comprises political, spiritual, psychological, practical and philosophical values. Thus, to commemorate the sacred day when Lord Krishna offered his philosophical teachings to King Arjuna during the battle of Kurukshetra, people celebrate Gita Jayanti."
