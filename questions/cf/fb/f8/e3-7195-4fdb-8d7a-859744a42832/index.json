  "question": "What is the relation between Time period and Frequency in case of uniform circular motion?",
  "option1": "reciprocal to each other",
  "option2": "equal to each other",
  "option3": "no relation between them",
  "option4": "Time period is one half of the Frequency",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "reciprocal to each other",
  "explanation": "Time period and Frequency are reciprocal to each other in case of uniform circular motion. Time period = 1 /Frequency Time Period is the time taken by the object to complete one revolution. Frequency is the number of revolutions completed by the object in unit time."
