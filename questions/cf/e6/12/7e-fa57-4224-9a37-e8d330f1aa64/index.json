  "question": "With reference to the All India Survey on Higher Education report published by the HRD ministry, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The report showed increased enrolment in the sciences stream than in the humanities streams.</li>\n<li>All states showed higher number of girls enrolled in higher education than boys.</li>\n<li>Gross Enrolment Rate cannot be over 100%.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "All are incorrect",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are incorrect",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe report by the human resource development ministry showed that the Indian students are preferring arts streams over the sciences for higher studies. The report shows that at the undergraduate level, the enrolment rate for science was only 16.5% while that for the humanities stream was about 35.9%.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nOnly two states showed higher number of girls enrolled for higher education than boys. Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka has more girls in higher education in the age group of 18 to 23 years than the boys in the same age group. Also, the female enrolment increased from 47.6% to 48.6%.\n<strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong>\nGross enrolment ratio/ GER is a statistical measure of the number of students enrolled as a percentage of the population in that age group. It can be more than 100%. This is because of factors like repetition of grade by some students, late enrolment, etc."
