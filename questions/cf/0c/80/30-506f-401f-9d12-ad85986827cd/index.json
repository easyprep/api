  "question": "The 2019 union budget proposes borrowing from external markets in external currencies- in the form of sovereign bonds. Consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>These bonds are issued only by national governments.</li>\n<li>These proposed bonds are also called Masala bonds.</li>\n<li>India’s sovereign bonds belong to the same category as OATS, Gilts and JGBs.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "None of the above",
  "option3": "All of the above",
  "option4": "1 and 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong> Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nSovereign bonds are issued by national governments as securities for borrowing. The government would pay the periodic interest on this borrowing. At the end of maturity period, it would pay back the face value. Though such bonds are usually dominated by domestic currency, it can also involve foreign exchange. Using foreign exchange brings in the effect of changes in exchange rate. Eg: Rupee depreciation would mean more amount to be paid back than borrowed.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nMasala bonds are those that are issued by any Indian entity. On the other hand sovereign bonds are issued only by the government. The decision to issue such bond was taken in light of India’s low sovereign external debt (less than 5% of GDP). Also the move would free up more investable money for borrowing by private players and also would bring down the borrowings’ interest rate. This would infuse much needed credit into the sectors.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nOATS is the sovereign bond of France, while Gilts are issued by British government. The Japanese counterpart is the JGB. The economic and financial position of the government are major contributors to the value of their sovereign bonds. US treasuries are some of the best valued bonds of this kind"
