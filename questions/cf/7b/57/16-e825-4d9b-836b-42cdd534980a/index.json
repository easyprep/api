  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The amount of freight carried by railways is a function not only of the route length of railways but also a number of other factors such as the availability of inland waterways and the length of rail routes. In countries having facilities of inland<br />waterways, more freight tends to be carried by waterways than railways."
