  "explanation": "Guinea, Senegal and The Gambia are the basin countries of the \"Gambia River\". The Gambia River is a major river in West Africa, running 1,120 kilometres from the Fouta Djallon plateau in north Guinea westward through Senegal and The Gambia to the Atlantic Ocean at the city of Banjul. It is navigable for about half that length. The river is strongly associated with The Gambia, the smallest country in mainland Africa, which consists of little more than the downstream half of the river and its two banks.",
