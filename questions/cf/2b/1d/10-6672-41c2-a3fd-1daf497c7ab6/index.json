  "question": "What is the relationship between half-life period and initial concentration of the reacting species for a first order reaction?",
  "option1": "Both are directly proportional to each other",
  "option2": "Both are inversely proportional to each other",
  "option3": "Both are independent of each other",
  "option4": "The half life is twice the concentration of reacting species",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both are independent of each other",
  "explanation": "For a first order reaction, half-life period is constant, i.e., it is independent of initial concentration of the reacting species. for a zero order reaction, it is directly proportional to the initial concentration of the reactants and inversely proportional to the rate constant. ."
