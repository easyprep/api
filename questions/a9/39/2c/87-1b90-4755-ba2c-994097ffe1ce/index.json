  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "In India, the party whip directs the party members to stick to the party\\'s stand on certain issues and directs them to vote as per the direction of senior party members. Whip cannot be used in all cases. For example, Political parties cannot issue any direction or whip to members to vote or not in Presidential poll. The implication of a not to follow a Whip on Member\\'s part is to risk losing their seat in Parliament on account of defection."
