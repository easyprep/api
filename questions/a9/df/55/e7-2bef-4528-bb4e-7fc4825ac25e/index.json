  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nOcean banks are geological structures represented by shallow seabeds. The shallowness is caused by an underwater elevation like a hill or a shoal. The Bahamas are located on an ocean bank feature. There are 3 Bahamas banks that produced the islands: Cay Sal Bank, Great Bahamas Bank and the Little Bahamas Bank.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nHurricane Andrew remained the strongest storm to strike the island country until the Hurricane Dorian. Hurricane Andrew had struck Bahamas in 1992 and was also a category 5 storm like Dorian. The Hurricane Dorian which struck the country in September 2019 recorded speeds of about 355kmph leading to loss of life and property."
