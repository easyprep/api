  "question": "In which of the following layers of atmosphere, vertical movement or convection of air leads to clouds generation?",
  "option1": "Troposphere",
  "option2": "Stratosphere",
  "option3": "Mesosphere",
  "option4": "Exosphere",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Troposphere",
  "explanation": "In troposphere vertical movement&nbsp;or&nbsp;convection&nbsp;of&nbsp;air&nbsp;generates clouds. There is no regular&nbsp;convection&nbsp;and associated turbulence in stratosphere. In Mesosphere, Noctilucent clouds are&nbsp;formed which are small ice crystals which requires a combination of very low temperatures, a source of water vapour, and nuclei on which ice can grow."
