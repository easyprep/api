  "question": "Consider the following comparisons drawn between United Nation Security Council and the International Court of Justice: <ol> <li>While the United Nation Security Council has fifteen member states, the International Court of Justice has five judges</li> <li>While election to the UNSC is conducted only in the General Assembly, election for ICJ is held concurrently in the UNGA and UNSC</li> </ol>  Which of the above is/are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct.",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>First statement is incorrect </strong> While the Security Council has 15 member states, the International Court of Justice has 15 judges. <strong>Second statement is correct</strong> While election to the UNSC is conducted only in the General Assembly, election for ICJ is held concurrently in the UNGA and UNSC. While it requires two-third majority in UNGA to get elected to non permanent seat of UNSC, it requires absolute majority of the total membership in each organ- UNGA and UNSC to be elected as judge into the International Court of Justice. While veto applies to UNSC, it does not apply for election to the ICJ."
