  "question": "Which country was the location of the event \"Year Without a Summer-1816\"?",
  "option1": "Philippines",
  "option2": "Vietnam",
  "option3": "Indonesia",
  "option4": "Malaysia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Indonesia",
  "explanation": "Indonesia was the location of the event \"Year Without a Summer-1816\". The year 1816 is known as the Year Without a Summer, also known as the Poverty Year and Eighteen Hundred and Froze To Death, because of severe climate abnormalities that caused average global temperatures to decrease by 0.4–0.7 °C. This resulted in major food shortages across the Northern Hemisphere. Evidence suggests that the anomaly was predominantly a volcanic winter event caused by the massive 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in April in the Dutch East Indies (known today as Indonesia). This eruption was the largest in at least 1,300 years and perhaps exacerbated by the 1814 eruption of Mayon in the Philippines.",
