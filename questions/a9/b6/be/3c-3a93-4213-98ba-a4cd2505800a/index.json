The MSME sector has been facing stress due to the demonetisation exercise and implementation of GST.  The panel would review the current institutional framework in place to support the MSME sector, and examine the factors affecting the timely and adequate availability of finance to the sector. The panel will also review existing MSME-focussed policies and their impact, and study the global best practices with respect to MSMEs and recommend their adoption in India.  The committee will submit its report by the end of June 2019."
