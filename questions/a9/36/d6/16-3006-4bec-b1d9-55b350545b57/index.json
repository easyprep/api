  "question": "The researchers at which university in US have developed a new method to purify water used in oil refinement?",
  "option1": "Stanford University",
  "option2": "Clemson University",
  "option3": "University of Arkansas",
  "option4": "Purdue University",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Purdue University",
  "explanation": "Researchers at Purdue University in the US, including one of Indian origin, have developed a new process  to remove nearly all traces of oil in produced water -- a byproduct from the oil refinery and extraction process.   The process  uses activated charcoal foam and subjects it to solar light to produce heat and purify the water. The foam absorbs the oil contaminants from the water. Ashreet Mishra, a graduate research assistant at the Purdue University, said that this is a simple, clean and inexpensive treatment process.  The process meets all environmental standards for clean water from industrial sources and had a total organic carbon of 7.5 milligrams per litre. Another advantage is that the oil absorbed by the foam can be recovered efficiently.  The researchers were able to recover up to 95% of the oil that was absorbed. The process could be integrated with existing disposal systems to purify a large amount of water and reduce the current stress on water grids."
