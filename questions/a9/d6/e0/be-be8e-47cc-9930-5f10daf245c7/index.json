  "option2": "1, 2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 and 4",
  "option4": "2 and 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe largest sugar producer in the world is Brazil. India is set to overtake the country in a few years. Sugar is produced mainly in the tropical countries. It is a water intensive crop. Though Guatemala is not the largest producer, it is highly dependent on sugar exports. It exports 70% of the sugar produced in the country.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nGuatemala along with a few other countries like Australia and Brazil have called for a dispute resolution panel set up at the WTO. They have registered concerns against India’s practice of subsidising sugar farmers in the country. It has filed the dispute under 3 provisions of WTO- Agreement on agriculture, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and also the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. The WTO is a 164 member strong body. It formulates trade rules.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe Dispute Settlement Panel is set up on an ad hoc basis by the Dispute settlement body. The system is central to multilateral trading body. It is composed of the General Council members of WTO. It makes use of “reverse consensus” mechanism for deciding. It gives the losing state a window time period for restoring its compliance to WTO rules.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe WTO has an appellate body established in 1995. It has 7 judges but can function with 3. The appellate body is used if the dispute settlement system fails to deliver. It has recently allowed for amicus curiae and access of third parties as part of reform measures."
