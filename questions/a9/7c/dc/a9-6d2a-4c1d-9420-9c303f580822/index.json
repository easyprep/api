  "question": "Which of the following statements is correct about the value of acceleration due to gravity (g) in a light and heavy falling body?",
  "option1": "the value of g will be greater in the light body",
  "option2": "the value of g will be greater in the heavy body",
  "option3": "the value of g will be equal in both the bodies",
  "option4": "the value of g depends on the mass",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "the value of g will be equal in both the bodies",
  "explanation": "Acceleration due to gravity is independent of mass, shape, size etc. of falling body. Therefore, a light and heavy body will have equal acceleration."
