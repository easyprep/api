It was first discovered on the cay in 1845 by Europeans who shot the “large rats” for sport. The Bramble Cay Melomys is an extinct species of rodent in the family Muridae and subfamily Murinae. Australia officially declared this Great Barrier Reef rodent extinct, making it the first mammal believed to have been killed off by human-induced climate change."
