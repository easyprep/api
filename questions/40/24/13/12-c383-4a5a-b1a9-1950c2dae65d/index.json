  "option1": "Boxing",
  "option2": "Wrestling",
  "option3": "Archery",
  "option4": "Weightlifting",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Boxing",
  "explanation": "In boxing and some other sports, a southpaw stance is where the boxer has their right hand and right foot forward, leading with right jabs, and following with a left cross right hook. It is the normal stance for a left-handed boxer. The corresponding boxing designation for a right-handed boxer is orthodox and is generally a mirror-image of the southpaw stance. In American English, \"southpaw\" generally refers to a person who is left-handed."
