  "question": "The decision of an inferior court or tribunal can be quashed when there is an error of law, by issuing a writ of which of the following nature?",
  "option1": "Mandamus",
  "option2": "Prohibition",
  "option3": "Certiorari",
  "option4": "None of them",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Certiorari",
  "explanation": "Certiorari is kind of prerogative writ which orders the removal of a suit from an inferior court to a higher court. A writ to Certiorari and Prohibition are sought together so that the inferior court or tribunal operates within its jurisdiction and does not usurp jurisdiction. Like Prohibition, a writ of Certiorari is opposite that of Mandamus which directs a judicial or administrative body to perform its duty and a writ of Certiorari is issued against only judicial or quasi-judicial authorities. By a writ of Certiorari a decision of an inferior court or tribunal is quashed when there is an error of law, or the subject matter is beyond the jurisdiction of the body or it assumes jurisdiction on the basis of a wrong decision or the inferior court or tribunal has violated the principles of natural justice. In these cases the High Court can issue a writ of Certiorari and quash a decision of the inferior court or tribunal and the Supreme Court can issue this writ of Certiorari if some fundamental rights have been infringed upon in such cases"
