  "question": "At which of the following places water would boil at lowest temperature?",
  "option1": "Delhi",
  "option2": "Shimla",
  "option3": "Kochi",
  "option4": "Jodhpur",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Shimla",
  "explanation": "Shimla is the place among the options where water boils at low temperature. At higher altitudes, air pressure is lower. When atmospheric pressure is lower, such as at a higher altitude, it takes less energy to bring water to the boiling point. Less energy means less heat, which means water will boil at a lower temperature at a higher altitude."
