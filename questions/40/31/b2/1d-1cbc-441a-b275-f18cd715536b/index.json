  "question": "Which among the following play role on formation of Ocean currents?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Rotation of Earth</li>\r\n<li>Revolution of Earth</li>\r\n<li>Gravitational Pull by Sun and Moon</li>\r\n<li>Prevailing Winds</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nChoose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 & 4",
  "option2": "1, 3 & 4",
  "option3": "1, 2, 3 & 4",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "The currents in the oceans are originated due to combined effects of several internal as well as external factors, which control the origin and other characteristics of ocean current. Regarding Revolution, we know that Earth is tilted and due to revolution of earth, various regions are tipped away or toward the sun during round the year journey around Sun. This creates opposite seasons in northern and southern hemispheres. This affects global air circulation and global air circulation would affect the ocean currents."
