Lawmakers comfortably passed part of a bill that would allow gay couples to enter into exclusive permanent unions and apply for marriage registration with government agencies. The vote allows same-sex couples full legal marriage rights, including in areas such as taxes, insurance, and child custody. Taiwan is a self-governing democracy with a vibrant civil society."
