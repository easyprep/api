  "option1": "Norway",
  "option2": "Ireland",
  "option3": "Switzerland",
  "option4": "Italy",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Ireland",
  "explanation": "Ireland became the first country in the world to completely divest from fossil fuels. In this regard, Irish Parliament passed legislation that will drop coal, oil, and gas (fossil fuel) investments from its $8.56 billion Ireland Strategic Investment Fund. Once enacted, the bill will force the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to sell its investment in fossil fuel industries over the next five years. Earlier in 2015, Norway&rsquo;s sovereign pension fund had divested from some fossil fuel companies, but not fully."
