  "option2": "Assertion is incorrect, Reason is correct",
  "option3": "Both Assertion and Reason are correct",
  "option4": "Both Assertion and Reason are incorrect",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Assertion is correct, Reason is incorrect",
  "explanation": "The first statement is correct because some sugarcane varieties are known to be capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen in association with a bacterium called Glucoacetobacter diazotrophicus. But, second statement is incorrect because, in contrary to legumes and other nitrogen fixing plants which form root nodules in the soil in association with bacteria, G. diazotrophicus lives within the intercellular spaces of the sugarcane&#8217;s stem. Please note that if you are given some options such as Potato, Wheat, Barley and Sugarcane and asked which of them would requires maximum amount of N, the answer would be Sugarcane."
