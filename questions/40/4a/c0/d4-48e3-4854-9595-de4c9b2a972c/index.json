  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "2 and 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 and 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 and 3 Only",
  "explanation": "First statement is incorrect because Union Home Minister is the chairman of Zonal Councils. The idea of creation of Zonal Councils was mooted by the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru in 1956 when during the course of debate on the report of the States Re-organisation Act, 1956. At present, there are 5 Zonal councils and one North East council for North Eastern states. Zonal Councils are not Constitutional bodies akin to the Interstate Council. However, since they have been established via the<strong> part III of the States Reorganization Act of 1956</strong>, they are statutory bodies."
