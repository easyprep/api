The excerpts of this system are -<br />a) the allying Indian state\\'s ruler was compelled to accept the permanent stationing of a British force within his territory and to pay a subsidy for its maintenance.<br />b) the Indian ruler could not employ any European in his service without the prior approval of the British. Nor could he <br />negotiate with any other Indian ruler without consulting the governor-general.<br />c) In return for all this, the British agreed to defend the ruler from his enemies and adopt a policy of non-interference in the internal matters of the allied state."
