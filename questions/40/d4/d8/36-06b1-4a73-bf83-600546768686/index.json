  "explanation": "• Bauxite ore is the world\\'s main source of aluminum. Bauxite is a rock formed from a reddish clay material called laterite soil and is most commonly found in tropical or subtropical regions. Bauxite is primarily comprised of aluminum oxide compounds, silica, iron oxides and titanium dioxide.<br />• Hematite is also spelled as hematite. It is a common iron oxide with the formula Fe2O3 and is widespread in rocks and soils.<br />• Galena is also called lead glance. It is the natural mineral form of lead sulfide. It is the most important ore of lead and an important source of silver. Galena is one of the most abundant and widely distributed sulfide minerals. It crystallizes in the cubic crystal system often showing octahedral forms.<br />• Monazite is a rare phosphate mineral with a chemical composition of (Ce,La,Nd,Th)(PO4,SiO4). It usually occurs in small isolated grains, as an accessory mineral in igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granite, pegmatite, schist, and gneiss."
