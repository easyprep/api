  "question": "Which of the following ecoregion is \"Guianan Highlands moist forests\"?",
  "option1": "Amazon Biome",
  "option2": "Saharan Biome",
  "option3": "Indomalayan Biome",
  "option4": "Australasian Biome",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Amazon Biome",
  "explanation": "The Guianan Highlands moist forests is an ecoregion in the south of Venezuela and the north of Brazil and in Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana. It is in the Amazon biome. It encompasses an upland region with diverse fauna and flora, which contains dramatic tepuis, or sandstone table mountains. The region has been inaccessible in the past and is generally fairly intact, apart from the north and northeast where large scale agriculture, ranching and mining operations are steadily encroaching on the ecosystem. New roads are opening the interior to logging, and planned dams will have a drastic impact on the riparian zones.",
