  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Badami Chalukyas are the earliest Chalukyan rulers. They ruled the region in 6<sup>th</sup> century CE from Vatapi. Vatapi is also known as Badami. The dynasty split in 11<sup>th</sup> century CE after the death of Pulakesin II and gave rise to the Western and Eastern Chalukyas.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe recently found inscription in one of the tower structures in Pattadakal shows that it was the burial site of Vikramaditya II. Earlier, it was thought that these structures were depiction of Jyotirlinga. Now it is believed that the structures marked the royal burial site."
