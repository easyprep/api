  "answer": "Otto Wichterle",
  "explanation": "Otto Wichterle, a Czech chemist, invented the modern soft contact lenses in 1959. He invented the first soft (hydrogel) contact lenses and got the approval of the USA Food and Drug Administration in 1971. These soft lenses were soon prescribed more often than rigid ones, due to the immediate and much greater comfort (rigid lenses require a period of adaptation before full comfort is achieved)."
