  "question": "Consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The Central Government fixes the wage rates in MGNREGA on the basis of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948</li>\r\n<li>As per the provisions of the NREGA Act, the revision of the Wage rates are to be done on periodical basis</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "First statement is incorrect because, The wage rates in MNREGA are fixed as per the provisions of Section 6 (1) of the act which says: “Notwithstanding anything contained in the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 (11 of 1948), the Central Government may, by notification, specify the wage rate for the purpose of this Act.” As far as revision of the wage rates is concerned the act does not talk about the periodic revisions. It has been only possible after MNREGA rates are linked to the CPI- Agricultural labour."
