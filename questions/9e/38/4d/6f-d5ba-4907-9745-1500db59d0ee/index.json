  "answer": "Germany",
  "explanation": "\"Eurogame\", a type of board game, is originated in Germany. A Eurogame, also called a German-style board game, German game, or Euro-style game is a class of tabletop games that generally have indirect player interaction and abstract physical components. Eurogames are sometimes contrasted with American-style board games, which generally involve more luck, conflict, and drama. They are usually less abstract than chess or Go, but more abstract than wargames. Likewise, they generally require more thought and planning than party games such as Pictionary or Trivial Pursuit."
