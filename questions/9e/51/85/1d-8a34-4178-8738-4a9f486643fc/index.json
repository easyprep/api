  "explanation": "British colonial rule had a tremendous impact <em>on</em> all sections of <em>Indian</em> society. They extracted <em>as</em> much money <em>as</em> possible from the peasants <em>and</em> tribal people. From 1763 to 1856 there were <em>more</em> than 40 major rebellions. The Sanyasis rose in rebellion after the great <em>famine</em> of 1770 in Bengal. The intensity of famine increased in India, under the British rule because the British were continuously draining India’s wealth."
