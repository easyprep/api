  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "The second clause of first statement is wrong. The second statement is incorrect because states are asked for their view and they can put their view in stipulated time. However, even if a state says no, parliament has power to alter the boundaries. Thus final say is of Parliament."
