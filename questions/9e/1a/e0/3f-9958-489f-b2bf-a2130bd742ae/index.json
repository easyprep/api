  "option1": "Gabon",
  "option2": "Gambia",
  "option3": "Guinea",
  "option4": "Ghana",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Gabon",
  "explanation": "Gabon forms the location of the Abanda Caves which houses the unique Orange Cave Crocodiles. The orange dwarf crocodiles living in Abanda caves in Gabon were first discovered back in 2008 and confirmed in 2010. Soon thereafter, it was discovered that older specimens had an orange hue due to the acidity of the bat guano in the water in which they lived. A prior expedition had discovered that at least some of the younger and smaller dwarf crocs made their way outside of the caves each spring to mate and produce young, but it is still unclear if the larger crocs are also able to do so. Prior expedition teams had also found that the crocs lived by eating bats and crickets, which is notably different from those that live just outsideâ€”they eat fish and other crustaceans."
