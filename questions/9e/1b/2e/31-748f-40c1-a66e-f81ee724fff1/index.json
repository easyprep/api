  "question": "A boat goes 20 km downstream in one hour and the same distance upstream in two hours. The speed of the boat in still water is:",
  "option1": "5 km/hr",
  "option2": "7.5 km/hr",
  "option3": "10 km/hr",
  "option4": "15 km/hr",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "15 km/hr",
  "explanation": "Let the speed of boat in still water be x km/hr and the rate of stream be y km/hr.\r\nâˆ´ Downstream rate = (x + y) km/hr\r\nand upstream rate = (x - y) km/hr\r\n$latex Now, \\\\frac{20}{x + y} = 1&s=1$\r\n$latex => x + y = 20 .......\\\\left ( 1 \\\\right )$\r\n$latex and \\\\frac{20}{x-y} = 2&s=1$\r\n$latex => x - y = 10 .......\\\\left ( 2 \\\\right )$\r\nFrom (1) and (2) we have \r\nx = 15 km/hr.\r\nHence option [D] is correct answer."
