  "question": "Which of the following are ‘erosional landforms’ ?\r\n1.Inselbergs<br />2.Loess<br />3.Zeugen<br />4.Buttes",
  "option1": "1 and 2",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1, 3 and 4",
  "option4": "All of them",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 3 and 4",
  "explanation": "Loess is a depositional landform (aeolian sediment formed by accumulation of wind-blown silt) whereas the others namely, Inselbergs, Zeugen and Buttes are erosional landforms.\r\nInselberg is a term for an isolated hill or a lone mountain that has risen above the surrounding area, typically by surviving erosion.\r\nZeugens are formed by wind abrasion where a surface layer of hard rock is underlain by a layer of soft rock into a ridge and furrow landscape.\r\nButtes are formed by erosion when hard cap rock covers a layer of softer rock that is eventually worn away. The hard rock thus resists erosion."
