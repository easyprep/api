  "answer": "Gabon",
  "explanation": "Loango National Park is an IUCN Category II national park located in western Gabon. It protects diverse coastal habitat, including part of the 220 km² Iguela Lagoon, the only significant example of a typical western African lagoon system that is protected within a national park. Situated between the Nkomi and Ndogo Lagoons, Loango National Park is the true jewel of Africa's western coast. The naturalist Mike Fay called Loango 'Africa's Last Eden' and this is where Michael Nichols from National Geographic took his well-known pictures of surfing hippos. Both men call Loango the 'Land of surfing hippos'. After South Africa, the world’s largest concentration and variety of whales and dolphins can be found right off the Loango coast."
