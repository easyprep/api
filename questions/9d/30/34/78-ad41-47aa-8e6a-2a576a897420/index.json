In the past, Australia had temporarily ceased to be a member because of its reluctance to be a part of anti-China activities.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe QUAD was formed due to the initiative of Japan in 2007. It was formed post the collaboration among the four countries during the 2004 tsunami. The countries constituted the Tsunami Core Group and provided humanitarian aid in the region."
