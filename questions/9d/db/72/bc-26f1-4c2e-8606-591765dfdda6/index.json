  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "All are incorrect",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe ecotourism circuit will involve forest safaris to 124 forest gardens, 6 tiger projects, 33 wildlife sanctuaries and also several hill stations. Ecotourism is not simply tourism to forests and other pristine natural habitats. It is the use of sustainable practice when utilising the tourism potential of a place. The Sanjay Gandhi National is to feature in this circuit.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe ecotourism circuit will also feature forts and religious destinations in the state. Currently, 43 forts, 52 religious destinations, 55 ecotourism destinations, etc. have been planned for incorporation. The state has many hill forts in various stages of decay and the incorporation would bring better protection to these sites.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nMohonk Agreement was the first to distinguish ecotourism as a subtype of sustainable tourism. It gives the principles and frameworks for defining ecotourism. It involves environmental, economic and sociocultural aspects. It is the reference for several ecotourism certifications used in the international tourism sector.\n&nbsp;"
