  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Articles 245 to 254, pertaining to the powers of Parliament, manifest without any ambiguity that the Centre has been empowered to control the acts of States under the DOCTRINE OF REPUGNANCY particularly in the Concurrent List. Further, the doctrine of occupied field and the doctrine of severability play a vital role in overriding the role of the States in the law making process in the Concurrent List ( AIR 1979 SC 898 (M. Karunanidhi vs. Union of India) and AIR 1996 SC 2384 (T.K.V.T.S.S. Medical and Educational Charitable Trust vs. State of Tamil Nadu). Apart from that, ‘President’s Rule’ under Article 356 speaks of the power of the Centre over the States in case of failure of the constitutional machinery (AIR 1994-SC-1918 (Bommai’s case)."
