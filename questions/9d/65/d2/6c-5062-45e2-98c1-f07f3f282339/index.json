  "question": "Why is it easier to cook in a pressure cooker?",
  "option1": "High pressure creates turbulence",
  "option2": "More steam is formed inside the cooker",
  "option3": "Boiling point of water is raised",
  "option4": "Boiling point of water is lowered",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Boiling point of water is raised",
  "explanation": "When heat is supplied to the pressure cooker, after boiling point of liquid, pressure rises tremendously which raises boiling point temperature. This is due to steam trapped within the system and unable to escape from it. Hence pressure rises above atmospheric pressure."
