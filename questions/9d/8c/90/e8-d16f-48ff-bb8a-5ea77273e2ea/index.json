  "question": "Consider the following statements about the Stand-Up India Scheme: <ol> <li>The scheme facilitates bank loans between 1 Lakh to 10 lakh for small entrepreneurial activities</li> <li>The scheme is anchored by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) </li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",

  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because the objective of the Stand-Up India scheme is to facilitate bank loans between <em>10 lakh and 1 Crore</em> to at least one Scheduled Caste (SC) or Scheduled Tribe (ST) or woman borrower per bank branch for setting up a Greenfield enterprise. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u> because the scheme is anchored by Department of Financial Services (DFS). The <em>Stand-Up India scheme</em> launched by the government in 2015 is expected to benefit at-least 2.5 lakh borrowers in a time span of about 36 months from the date of launch. The scheme provides for creation of a credit guarantee mechanism through the National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company (NCGTC) and provides for refinance window through Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI). The major idea behind such scheme is to leverage the institutional credit structure to reach out to these under-served sectors of the society by facilitating bank loans. The loans given under this scheme are non-farm loans repayable up to 7 years. The enterprise set up under this scheme can be a manufacturing, trading or even service sector and can be established either by an individual or a group."
