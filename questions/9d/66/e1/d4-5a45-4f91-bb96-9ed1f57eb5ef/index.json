  "answer": "Dandi March",
  "explanation": "Dandi March(12th March 1930) also known as the Salt Satyagraha, was undertaken by Gandhiji . He led the Dandi march from his base, Sabarmati Ashram near Ahmedabad, to the sea coast near the village of Dandi. The triggering factor for this movement was the British monopoly of salt trade in India and the imposition of a salt tax. It was a direct action campaign of tax resistance and nonviolent protest against the British salt monopoly in colonial India, and triggered the wider Civil Disobedience Movement. “On bended knees I asked for bread and I have received stone instead”, was a remark made by Gandhi ji in the beginning of the march."
