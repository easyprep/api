  "question": "What is the gravitational potential energy for infinite distance?",
  "option1": 0,
  "option2": "infinity",
  "option3": "9.8 J",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 0,
  "explanation": "The gravitational potential energy of a body at a point is defined as the amount of work done in bringing the body from infinity to that point against the gravitational force. U = - GMm/r When r =infinity, then U =0"
