  "answer": "1 and 2",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong> Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nOdisha is facing drought like conditions and this has resulted in distressed migration. Such conditions lead to mass migrations in search of work. The government is countering the problem by using “Shramik Sanghs” formed to use the MGNREG scheme. The government is currently able to ensure about 38 days of employment on average. By use of this organisational concept, it looks to increase the average to 65 days.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nEach Shramik Sangh will have about 50 members. Each sangh will have an appointed member called the Mate. This person is responsible for ensuring job opportunities for its members for the minimum prescribed days. These will be focused on active card holders.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Shramik Sanghs will be organised at the level of revenue village. Each revenue village is headed by a Village Administrative Officers and maybe composed of one or more hamlets. Gram Panchayat is the grass-root level unit of the Panchayat Raj system."
