  "option3": "equal displacements in equal intervals of time",
  "option4": "unequal displacements in equal intervals of time",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "equal displacements in unequal intervals of time",
  "explanation": "An object is said to be in non-uniform motion if it undergoes equal displacements in unequal intervals of time. In non-uniform motion, the velocity is different at different instants."
