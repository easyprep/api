He also spoke about abolition of landlordism and liquidation of agricultural indebtedness. Subhas Chandra Bose constituted a Planning Committee under the Chairmanship of Jawaharlal Nehru for rapid industrialization of India on modern lines in consideration of the latter’s close relationship with Mahatma Gandhi, who was not in favour of Industrialisation Programme"
