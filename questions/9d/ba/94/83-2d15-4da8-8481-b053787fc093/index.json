  "explanation": "U.S. President Donald J. Trump has recently signed the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act (ARIA) into law. The act seeks to establish a multifaceted U.S. strategy to increase U.S. security, economic interests, and values in the Indo-Pacific region. Specifically, the ARIA authorises a spending of US$1.5 billion over a five year period to enhance cooperation with Americaâ€™s strategic regional allies in East and Southeast Asia. The act will pave the way to develop a long-term strategic vision and a comprehensive, multifaceted, and principled United States policy for the Indo-Pacific region, and for other purposes. Hence, the act is designed to counter the encroaching influence and growing threat from China, and to reinvigorate US leadership in the region."
