  "question": "The HCF of two numbers is 23 and the other two factors of their LCM are 13 and 14. The larger of the two numbers is :",
  "option1": 276,
  "option2": 299,
  "option3": 322,
  "option4": 345,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 322,
  "explanation": "Let the numbers be 23x and 23y where x and y are co-prime to each other. \r\n∴ LCM = 23xy\r\nAs given, \r\n23xy = 23 $latex \\\\times$ 13 $latex \\\\times$ 14\r\n∴ x = 13, y = 14\r\n∴ The larger number = 23y = 23 $latex \\\\times$ 14 = 322\r\nHence option [C] is correct answer."
