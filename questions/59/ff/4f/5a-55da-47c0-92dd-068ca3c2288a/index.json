There is an in-built whistle, which can manipulate the phone speaker to create a loud noise when pressed by anyone in distress. The app also carries an in-built call recorder and \\'Tips\\' icon to provide life saving information. The meaning of \\'Ammavin Aran\\' is  \\\"mother\\'s fortress\\\". Currently, AIADMK is in power in Tamil Nadu and is the third largest party in the Indian Parliament."
