  "question": "Consider the following statements about the Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) Technology: <ol> <li>It is a remote sensing technology</li> <li>It is used to measure seafloor and riverbed elevations</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
