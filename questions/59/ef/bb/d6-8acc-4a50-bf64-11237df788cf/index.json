  "question": "In which year, Andaman and Nicobar Islands (Protection of Aboriginal Tribes) Regulation was promulgated?",
  "option1": 1962,
  "option2": 1956,
  "option3": 1951,
  "option4": 1966,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 1956,
  "explanation": "The North Sentinel Island is one of the Andaman Islands, which includes South Sentinel Island, in the Bay of Bengal. It is home to the Sentinelese who, often violently, reject any contact with the outside world, and are among the last uncontacted peoples to remain virtually untouched by modern civilisation.  Recently, it is in news because the American national  ‘John Allen Chau’  allegedly killed by people belonging to the protected Sentinelese tribe in the North Sentinel Island. It must be noted that  North Sentinel Island and its buffer zone is strictly restricted under the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (Protection of Aboriginal Tribes) Regulation, 1956  under Indian Forest Act, 1927.  In it, it is declared that the traditional areas occupied by the tribes as reserves, and prohibited entry of all persons except those with authorisation. Photographing or filming the tribe members is also an offence. The rules were amended later to enhance penalties. But restricted area permits were relaxed for some islands recently."
