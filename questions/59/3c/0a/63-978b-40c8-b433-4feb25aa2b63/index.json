  "question": "In order to understand the gravity of air pollution problems, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology has established a new system to examine the air quality and forecast the conditions. This system provides location-specific information on air quality in near real time. It monitors the presence of major gaseous pollutants like ozone, oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, benzene, hydrocarbons, PM10 and PM2.5 and the forecast is displayed in terms of Air Quality Index (AQI) at a scale of (0-500). This system engineers awareness drive by educating the public, prompting self-mitigation and also to help develop mitigation strategies for policymakers. The name of the system is _?",

  "answer": "SAFAR",
  "explanation": "Air pollution is one of the major problems in India, especially in metro cities. In order to understand the gravity of air pollution problems, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology has established a new system called System of Air Quality Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) to examine the air quality and forecast the conditions. This system provides location-specific information on air quality in near real time. It monitors the presence of major gaseous pollutants like ozone, oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, benzene, hydrocarbons, PM-10 and PM-2.5 and the forecast is displayed in terms of Air Quality Index (AQI) at a scale of (0-500). This system engineers awareness drive by educating the public, prompting self-mitigation and also to help develop mitigation strategies for policymakers."
