  "answer": "1 and 2",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nHeritage bylaws are drafted by the National Monuments Authority. The NMA is a quasi-judicial body established in 2010 under the AMASR act. Its function is monument preservation through regulation of the surrounding area. Construction in area of 100m surrounding protected monuments is prohibited and the heritage bylaws govern construction from 100m to 300m area.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe power of NMA to draft heritage bylaws was conferred by the AMASR act of 2010. The act prohibits construction (except in exceptional cases) in the 100m area around the monument. It also gives the NMA powers to make recommendations on allowing certain ‘public works’ projects (if no reasonable alternative exists) in the area. The authority will also study the impact of such works- on heritage, aesthetics and architecture.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nRed sandstone is a major component used in the construction of Sher Shah Gate. This gives the name of ‘Lal Darwaza’ to the gates. The structure is from the 16<sup>th</sup> century and was constructed by Sher Shah Suri. It is an example of Ashlar and rubble masonry work. In 2016, ASI had undertaken a project for the gate’s restoration.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is incorrect:\nKhair-ul-Manazil mosque is an example of Mughal architecture. It was constructed during the reign of Mughal emperor, Akbar. Its name translates as “the most auspicious house”. It too has red sandstone gateways. It was built in 1561 by Maham Anga- Akbar’s foster mother."
