  "question": "At which of the following places water shall boil at the lowest temperature?",
  "option1": "Kochi",
  "option2": "ooty",
  "option3": "Mount Abu",
  "option4": "New Delhi",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "ooty",
  "explanation": "This question is related to Antoine equation. Water to get boil, its vapour pressure must reach to its surrounding pressure. In a pressure cooker, it boils at the highest temperature. Elevation of Kochi is 0 m, ooty is 2,486 m, Mount Abu is 1,200 m, New Delhi is 216 m, Shimla is 2,205 m. So comparing all of them, water will boil at lowest temperature at ooty, followed by Shimla, Mount Abu , New Delhi and Kochi. This is because , higher we go lower is the atmospheric pressure and lower is the point where water`s vapour pressure gets equal to the atmospheric pressure."
