  "option2": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "All are incorrect",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe app was launched to promote the use of Custom Hiring Centres by the farmers. These centres rent out equipment that a farmer may need only occasionally or is too expensive for the farmer to buy. It will improve availability and accessibility of cutting edge technology even to small farmers.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe app is multilingual. The target audience of the app is the grass root level farmers and hence lingual accessibility is vital. The app will provide information in English, Hindi and Punjabi among others. The NIC/ National Informatics Centre is responsible for this app.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nThe app will enable farmers to rent out their equipment to others. This will enable them to increase their income. The app will also connect farm machinery banks, CHCs and Hi-tech Hub in the state. This will enable optimum utilisation of the equipment that is collectively available."
