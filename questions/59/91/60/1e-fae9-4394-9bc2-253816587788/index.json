  "question": "In light of recent studies linking the spread of Phocine Distemper Virus with climate change, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It affects only monkeys.</li>\n<li>It belongs to the same genus as the Measles virus.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",

  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Phocine Distemper Virus mainly attacks seals. It leads to adverse effects on breathing and nervous system functions. It can also cause fever and death. It is known to cause epidemics. Eg: in 2002, an epidemic in the North Sea wiped out over 50% of the seal population there.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:        </strong>\nThe Phocine Distemper Virus belongs to a viral genus called Morbillivirus. This is the genus to which the measles virus also belong. The PDV is naturally found only in the European and east coast regions of North America. With the melting of Arctic Ice, the virus has been spreading to new regions."
