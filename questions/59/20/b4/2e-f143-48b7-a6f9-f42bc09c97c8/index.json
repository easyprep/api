  "question": "Various edicts of Asoka mention:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Prohibition of animal sacrifice</li>\r\n<li>Religious toleration among all sects</li>\r\n<li>Asoka’s visit of Buddha’s birth place</li>\r\n<li>Amnesty to prisoners</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "option3": "Only 1, 2 & 4",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "All are correct statements. While framing this question, I was putting Cakhudane (Chakshu-Dan i.e. donating eye) in one of the options as <u>Eye donation</u>. But this term is ambiguous, so I did not use. Based on the context of those times, it appears that it Cakhudane to either ending blinding as a form of punishment or may be giving wisdom to someone."
