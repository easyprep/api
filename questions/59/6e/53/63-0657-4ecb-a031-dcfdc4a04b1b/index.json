  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "<strong>1. Civil Disobedience movement was called off by Mahatma Gandhi</strong><br />This statement is incorrect because the event led Gandhi to call off the Non-cooperation movement from Bardoli in February 1922 and not the Civil Disobedience movement.<br /><strong>2. There was a schism in the Congress</strong><br />The second statement is correct that there was a schism in the Congress.<br /><strong>3. Swaraj Party took a resolution to boycott elections and not rest before attaining swaraj</strong><br />Moti lal Nehru, C R Das, N C Kelkar, GS Gharpade and S Srinivas founded the Swaraj party. The third statement is incorrect, as they chose a middle path, as none of them was capable to lead such a large scale movement. So, they decided swaraj within the British Raj and that â€˜s what led them to contest the elections and win some handsome number of seats."
