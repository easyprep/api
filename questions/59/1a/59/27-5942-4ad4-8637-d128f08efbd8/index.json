  "question": "Which among the following can increase or decrease the half-life of a particular radionuclide?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Temperature and Pressure</li>\r\n<li>Duration</li>\r\n<li>Chemical Combination</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 2& 3",
  "option3": "Only 3",
  "option4": "None of them",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of them",
  "explanation": "<p class=\\\"Explanation\\\">Half-life is the time it takes for the number of radioactive nuclei originally present in a sample to decrease to one-half of their original number. Thus, if a sample has a half-life of one year, its radioactivity will be reduced to half its original amount at the end of a year and to one quarter at the end of two years. The half-life of a particular radionuclide is always the same, independent of temperature, chemical combination, or any other condition."
