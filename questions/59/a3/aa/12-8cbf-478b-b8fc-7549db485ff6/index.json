At that point, the members representing Bengal, Punjab, Sind, NWFP, etc. which went to Pakistan now, ceased to be members of the Constituent Assembly. In this process Dr. B.R. Ambedkar who had been elected from Bengal lost his seat. Later, he was elected by Bombay Legislative Congress Party as member of Constituent Assembly."
