He is best known for his saying: \\\"I am the Truth\\\", which many saw as a claim to divinity, while others interpreted it as an instance of annihilation of the ego which allows God to speak through the individual.<br />Al-Ghazali was one of the most prominent and influential philosophers, theologians, jurists, and sufi mystics of Sunni Islam. He was of Persian origin. Some Muslims consider him to be a Mujaddid, a renewer of the faith who, according to the prophetic hadith, appears once every century to restore the faith of the ummah."
