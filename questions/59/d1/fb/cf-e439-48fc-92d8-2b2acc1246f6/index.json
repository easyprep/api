  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe Yada Yada virus (YYV) infects only mosquitoes. It does not harm humans. It was recently discovered in Australia. It was named after a catchphrase in a sitcom in reference to virus discovery losing its novelty. The phrase ‘yada yada’ means boring.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nAlphaviruses are a group of RNA based viruses that infect both vertebrates and invertebrates. The Yada Yada Virus is a mosquito specific pathogen like Tai forest alphavirus and Agua Salud alphavirus. Alphavirus that infects other organisms include Chikungunya virus and the Astern Equine Encephalitis virus."
