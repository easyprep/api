  "explanation": "For Integrated coastal zone management (ICZM), the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has launched a draft titled ‘Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF)”, which is a part of a World Bank-funded project.   The draft plan will dictate how prospective infrastructure projects situated along the coast ought to be assessed before they can apply for clearance. The document lays out guidelines out for coastal States to adopt when they approve and regulate projects in coastal zones. The document was prepared by the Society for Integrated Coastal Management, a Ministry-affiliated body. So far three coastal States, namely Gujarat, Odisha and West Bengal, have prepared ICZM Plans with support from the World Bank. Such plans would be prepared for the selected coastal stretches in other States/UT."
