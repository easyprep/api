  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "The first statement is written reverse and is incorrect. Supreme Court can issue writs only for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights and not for other purposes. The high court can issue writs not only for the enforcement of the fundamental rights but also for other purposes. This implies that the writ jurisdiction of the high court is wider than that of the Supreme Court. However, supreme court can be empowered by the parliament to issue writs for other purposes.<br />The second statement is also incorrect."
