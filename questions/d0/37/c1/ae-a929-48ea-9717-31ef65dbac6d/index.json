  "answer": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The Himalaya extends like a curve of parallel ranges for nearly 2500 kilometres across southern Asia. The young fold mountains consist of a series of parallel ranges with deep valleys between them. Being young fold mountains, Himalaya has variety of rock structures, deep gorges and high pyramidal peaks. In High Himalayas the rivers have steep gradients, which result from the differential uplift of the High Himalayas. It has been suggested that a long and narrow arc of High Himalayas has been uplifted during quaternary. The classification of the Himalayan Ranges is done on three bases viz. Geographical, Regional and Geological."
