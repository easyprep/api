  "option1": "Kolkata Metro",
  "option2": "Mumbai Metro",
  "option3": "Chennai Metro",
  "option4": "Lucknow Metro",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Mumbai Metro",
  "explanation": "Mumbai Metro One will launch the India\\'s first Mobile Ticketing System \\'OnGo\\' which will help commuters pass the Automated Fare Collection (AFC) gates using their mobile phones. The system is in the final advanced stage of testing and will be implemented by mid-August. The commuters will be able to buy tickets or monthly passes using the Mumbai Metro app on their smartphone. Once they make the payment using their mobile wallet or e-wallet, a QR code will be generated. The gateâ€™s sensor will then scan this code and let them access the platform. The \\'OnGo\\' will be particularly convenient for those commuters wanting to book their journey through tokens or passes at their own convenience even from outside the Metro stations and avoid queues before ticketing windows."
