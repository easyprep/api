  "question": "On which of the following the gravitational force between two objects does not depend?",
  "option1": "Gravitational constant",
  "option2": "Distance between the objects",
  "option3": "Product of the masses of the objects",
  "option4": "Sum of the masses of the objects",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Sum of the masses of the objects",
  "explanation": "The gravitational force between two objects depends on the Gravitational constant, Distance between the objects and Product of the masses of the objects. F = Gravitational constant x (Product of the masses of the objects) / Square of Distance between the objects"
