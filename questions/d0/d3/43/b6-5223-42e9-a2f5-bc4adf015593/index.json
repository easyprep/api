  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 Only",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because the Sampoorna Bima Gram Yojna is an initiative under the Ministry of Communications and not under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. It is an initiative for expansion of clientele base of Postal Life Insurance. <u>Second statement is correct.</u> Under the Sampoorna Bima Gram (SBG) Yojana, at least one village (having a minimum of 100 households) will be identified in each of the revenue districts of the country. Once the village in the district is identified, endeavour will be made to cover all households of that identified village with a minimum of one RPLI (Rural Postal Life Insurance) policy each. The scheme is not only available to government and semi-government employees only, but will also be available to professionals such as doctors, engineers, management consultants, chartered accountants, architects, lawyers, bankers etc. and to the employees of listed companies of NSE (National Stock Exchange) and BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange)."
