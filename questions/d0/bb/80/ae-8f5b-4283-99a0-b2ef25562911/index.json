  "option2": "3 Only",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 & 2 Only",
  "explanation": "<u>First and second statements are correct</u>. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 by the Ministers of its Member jurisdictions. The major objective of the FATF is to set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering &amp; terrorist financing activities. <u>Third statement is incorrect</u> because India is a full-time member of the FATF and not with an Observer status. The FATF\\'s decision-making body, the FATF Plenary, meets three times per year. The first FATF mutual evaluation of India was done in 2010 when the body expressed satisfaction with the measures taken by the country. The next on-site mutual evaluation by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is scheduled in November-December 2020."
