  "answer": "Gaetano Mosca",
  "explanation": "In 1896, Gaetano Mosca wrote <em>The Ruling Class</em> in which he postulated that the people are necessarily divided into two groups: The Rulers and the Ruled. The ruling class controls most of the wealth, power and prestige in society whereas the ruled are not competent to replace it. Whatever form of government might be adopted, it is always this minority which exercises all power in society."
