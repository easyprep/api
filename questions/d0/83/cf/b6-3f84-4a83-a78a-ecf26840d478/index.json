  "answer": "New Caledonia",
  "explanation": "The Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Centre on the narrow Tinu Peninsula, northeast of the historic centre of Nouméa, the capital of New Caledonia, an overseas collectivity of France, celebrates the vernacular Kanak culture, the indigenous culture of New Caledonia, amidst much political controversy over the independent status sought by some Kanaks from French rule. It opened in June 1998 and was designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano and named after Jean-Marie Tjibaou, the leader of the independence movement who was assassinated in 1989 and had had a vision of establishing a cultural centre which blended the linguistic and artistic heritage of the Kanak people."
