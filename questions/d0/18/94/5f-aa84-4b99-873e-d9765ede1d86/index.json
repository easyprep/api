The pair will split the literary award\\'s Â£50,000 prize money equally. The Booker rules say the prize must not be divided, but the judges insisted they \\\"couldn\\'t separate\\\" the two works. Atwood (79) is the oldest-ever Booker winner, while Evaristo is the first black woman to win since its creation in 1969."
