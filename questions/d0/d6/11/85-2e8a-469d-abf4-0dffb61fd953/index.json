  "question": "Which of the following observations about the sedimentary Rocks on earth is / are correct?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Sedimentary rocks can be found in water bodies as well as on land</li>\r\n<li>Sedimentary rocks are found over the largest surface area of globe</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Both are correct statements.Â Sedimentary rocks are formed of sediments derived from the older rocks, plants and animal remains and thus these rocks contain fossils of plants and animals. Most of the sedimentary rocks are formed in water bodies but these are also formed at the land surface. As per estimate, almost 75 % of the surface area of the globe is covered with sedimentary rocks whereas igneous and metamorphic rocks cover the remaining 25% area."
