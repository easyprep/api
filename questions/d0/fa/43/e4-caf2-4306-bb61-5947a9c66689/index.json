  "question": "In the context of upcoming Germany-India summit, consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>Germany is the India’s largest trading partner in the EU.</li>\n<li>India terminated the Bilateral Investment Treaty with Germany.</li>\n<li>BTIA is a free trade agreement concluded between India and EU in 2013.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "2 and 3",
  "option2": "1 and 2",
  "option3": "2 only",
  "option4": "1 only",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 only",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nCurrently, UK is India’s largest trading partner in the EU. But with the forthcoming Brexit, Germany will occupy this position. Germany has a trade of 20 billion USD with India. Germany enjoys a trade surplus with India. The October summit seeks to find ways to make better use of the bilateral trade potential between the countries.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe bilateral investment treaty (BIT) was signed between India and several EU countries, including Germany. The purpose was to protect their investments in the signatory countries. India unilaterally withdrew from the treaty in 2017 to re-negotiate conditions- especially for introducing Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS), which binds the countries to exhaust the host state’s dispute settlement options before looking at international options.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe BTIA or bilateral trade and investment agreement is a free trade proposal, still in the discussion phase. Though the conception was in 2007, the progress has been in suspension since 2013. It deals with a range of issues like market access, farm subsidies, FDI etc. It is to be on the agenda of the October summit between India and Germany."
