  "question": "In context with the onset of the north-east monsoon in October, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>North-east monsoon’s onset and the south-west monsoon’s withdrawal usually coincides with each other.</li>\n<li>North-east monsoon brings precipitation to Tamil Nadu only.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe north-east monsoon or the winter monsoon usually succeeds the southwest-monsoon’s withdrawal after several weeks. However, the monsoons of 2019 presented a rare case. The withdrawal of the summer monsoon and the onset of the winter monsoon occurred simultaneously.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe north-east monsoon brings rainfall to several regions in peninsular India apart from Tamil Nadu. Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Rayalaseema and southern parts of interior Karnataka also receive rains from this monsoon. The north-east monsoon is important for the success of rabi crops.\n&nbsp;"
