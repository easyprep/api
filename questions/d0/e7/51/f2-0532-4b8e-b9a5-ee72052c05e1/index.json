  "question": "When are the two particles said to be in same phase?",
  "option1": "if the phase difference between them is an even multiple of π",
  "option2": "if the path difference is an even multiple of (<span class='symbol'>λ / 2)",
  "option3": "if the time interval is an even multiple of (T/ 2)",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "Two vibrating particle are said to be in same phase, if the phase difference between them is an even multiple of π or path difference is an even multiple of (<span class=\\'symbol\\'>λ</span> / 2) or time interval is an even multiple of (T/ 2)."
