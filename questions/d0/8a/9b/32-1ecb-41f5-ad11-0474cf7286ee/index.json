  "option1": "Czech Republic and Poland",
  "option2": "Czech Republic and Germany",
  "option3": "Czech Republic and Austria",
  "option4": "Czech Republic and Slovakia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Czech Republic and Germany",
  "explanation": "The Czech Republic and Germany are the two countries that share the location of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Erzgebirge/Krusnohori Mining Region\". The mining region of Erzgebirge/Krušnohori (Ore Mountains) is located between Saxony (Germany) and the Czechia. The transboundary serial property comprises 22 component parts that represent the spatial, functional, historical and socio-technological integrity of the territory; a self-contained landscape unit that has been profoundly and irreversibly shaped by 800 years of almost continuous polymetallic mining, from the 12th to 20th centuries. The relict structure and pattern of the Erzgebirge/Krušnohorri Mining Region remains highly legible and is characterized by specific and formative contributions made by the exploitation of different metals, at different times, in unevenly distributed locations defined by an exceptional concentration of mineral deposits."
