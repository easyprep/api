  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Britain",
  "explanation": "The researchers at the University of Leeds in Britain have created a new form of gold  which is 0.47 nanometres thick - one million times thinner than a human finger nail. They claimed that it is the world\\'s thinnest-ever unsupported gold. The  researchers  named their created precious metal as \\\"golden algae\\\" because of its greenish hue under water and the similarities between its shape and that of an algae\\'s. The Golden Algae is regarded as 2D because it consists of just two layers of atoms sitting on top of one another, so there are no \\\"bulk\\\" atoms hidden beneath the surface. According to researchers , the Golden Algae could have wide-scale applications in the medical device and electronics industries. It could also be used as a catalyst to speed up chemical reactions in a range of industrial processes."
