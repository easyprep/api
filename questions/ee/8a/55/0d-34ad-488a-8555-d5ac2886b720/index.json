  "question": "A person with which blood group will be a universal donor?",
  "option1": "A",
  "option2": "B",
  "option3": "O",
  "option4": "AB",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "O",
  "explanation": "Individuals with type O Rh D negative blood are often called universal donors. This lack of antigens means that type O negative blood can be transfused in people of any blood type; hence, the term universal blood donor. Individuals with the blood group O Rh negative are called “universal donors” because their red blood cells can be transfused to people of all blood groups."
