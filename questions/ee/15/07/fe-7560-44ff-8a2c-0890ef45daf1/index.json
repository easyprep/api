  "question": "Consider the following differences between biosimilars&nbsp;and generics: <ol> <li>While generics are made of complex chemical synthesis, biosimilars are simple structure made of living cells.</li> <li>Biosimilars&nbsp;are usually higher in purity and potency compared to generics.</li> </ol> Which of the above is/are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "The generic versions of biological products are referred to as biosimilars. &nbsp;First statement is incorrect because generics are simple structure, while biosimilars are complex. Second statement is incorrect because there is generally no difference between the biological product and their biosimilars, in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product.<br> &nbsp;"
