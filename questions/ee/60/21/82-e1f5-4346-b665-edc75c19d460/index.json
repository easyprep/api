Hard pressed, Aibek appealed to Muhammad Ghori for help. The latter came to the Punjab, crushed the revolt and helped Aibek in restoring law and order. On his return journey to Ghazni, he was encamped at Jhelum on the Indus when a party of the Khokhar dare-devils stealthily entered his tent and put him to death on March 15, 1206."
