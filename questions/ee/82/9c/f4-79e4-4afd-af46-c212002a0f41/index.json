  "explanation": "In Chandigarh, Union Minister for Home Affairs Amit Shah launched three citizen centric services - Emergency Response Support System (ERSS - Dial 112), ‘E-Beat Book’ System and the ‘E-Saathi App’ - of the Chandigarh Police.  ERSS has been designed to play a pivotal role in mitigation or preventing escalation of crime, especially against women and children. Citizens can send their emergency information through call, sms, email and through the 112 India mobile app. The ‘E-Beat Book’ is a web and mobile based application which will ease the collection, updation and analysis of the information related to crime and criminals in a real time. The ‘E-Saathi’ App would help the general public to remain in touch with the police and also give suggestions to facilitate participative community policing (‘Your Police at Your Doorstep’ initiative)."
