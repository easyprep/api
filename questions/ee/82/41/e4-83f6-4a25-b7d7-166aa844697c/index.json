  "question": "Who of the following join hands to develop eco-friendly e-crackers?",
  "option1": "CGCRI",
  "option2": "CSIR",
  "option3": "CIFNET",
  "option4": "CCRT",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "CSIR",
  "explanation": "Different labs of the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) have decided to put joint efforts for developing eco-friendly firecrackers and arriving at a cost-effective technology to make e-crackers (electronic-crackers). This research and development endeavour will initially focus on reduction of pollutants and in future will develop a solution which would remove the pollutants altogether from the compositions of firecrackers. e-crackers mainly contain high-voltage micro generators which spark at random intervals and create cracking sound just like firecrackers. For e-crackers, efforts will focus on developing low-cost technology in order to make it affordable for all consumers. Foreign-made e-crackers that are currently available in Indian market are bit expensive for average Indian consumer.",
