  "question": "With reference to the government’s discussions to curb ‘hot money flows’, consider the following statements about hot money:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Hot money is used for generating long-term interests.</li>\n<li>Hot money flows from low interest rate countries to high interest rate countries.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nHot money refers to currency that moves quickly and regularly between financial markets. These are speculative capital flows. Investors use it to generate short-term interests. It has potential to affect exchange rates and cause instabilities. Short-term foreign portfolio investors, short-term foreign bank loans and foreign bank loans with short-term investment are some examples.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nHot money tends to flow from low interest rate economies to high interest rate economies. This is because the investors move to economies with the highest short-term interest rates. This can potentially affect the countries’ balance of payment in an adverse way."
