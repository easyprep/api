  "option1": "Cement",
  "option2": "Power",
  "option3": "Steel",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Cement",
  "explanation": "Petroleum coke (petcoke) is a <strong><span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">key input material for cement producers</span></strong> and a highly polluting fuel. With decline in prices of petcoke and increase in demand for cement, the import of pet coke in the country increased. Pet coke is one of the major sources of environmental pollution. Petroleum coke is a by-product of the oil refinery industry. Petroleum coke refers to all types of carbonaceous solids obtained in petroleum processing. The majority of petcoke is produced in the U.S. but not used in U.S; rather huge amount is transported to India and China. For example, in 2016, the US sent more than 8 million metric tons of petcoke to India. Recently, Supreme Court requested the states and union territories to impose ban on use of pet coke."
