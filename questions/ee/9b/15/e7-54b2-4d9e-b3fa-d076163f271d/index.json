  "question": "Which of the following can be logically concluded from the fact that “<strong><em>atomic number of Iron is 26</em></strong>”?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Iron has same number of Protons and Neutrons</li>\r\n<li>Iron has 26 Protons</li>\r\n<li>All atoms which contain 26 protons are iron atoms</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The atomic number of an atom and its number of protons are the same. Thus, there are 26 protons in an iron atom. Another way to put this is that all atoms that contain 26 protons are, by definition, iron atoms."
