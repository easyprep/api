  "explanation": "Batta was a field allowance or extra pay or Active-Service allowance of the Company&#8217;s troops. Mir Jafar had doubled it when he had been installed for the second time as Nawab of Bengal. But in 1766, the Court of Directors decided to stop it. The decision was enforced by Lord Clive and the officers of East India Company tried to stop this enforcement. They joined together and threw up their commissions simultaneously as an act of agitation. This was kind of white mutiny but Clive meticulously overcame it."
