  "answer": "Neither 1 or 2",
  "explanation": "Both the statements are incorrect: Eyerovtuna is a India’s first underwater robotic drone. It is a remote-controlled submersible capable of sending real-time videos of ships and other underwater structures. It was developed by EyeROV Technologies, a company incubated at the Maker Village in Kochi, the country’s largest hardware incubator. It landed the first order from the Naval Physical and Oceanographic Laboratory (NPOL), a DRDO facility, here on Friday. The development of EyeROV was largely supported by Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) through various schemes."
