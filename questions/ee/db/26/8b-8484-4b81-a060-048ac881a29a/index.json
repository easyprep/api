  "question": "Consider the following statements: <ol> <li>All political parties in India are compulsorily required to register themselves with the Election Commission</li> <li>Using the name of religion in name of political parties is not allowed in India</li> </ol> Which among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "Please note that all political parties in India are compulsorily required to register themselves with the Election Commission and the declaration submitted by the political parties for this purpose has to state that the party believes in secularism and the constitutional principles. Religious fanaticism and 'fundamemalism' are contrary to Indian constitutional thought. Therefore, whatever be the name of a political party, approach to the voters in the name of religion is prohibited and so is also asking people not to vote for candidates of other religion. Thus, the religious intolerance has been kept out of Indian constitutional process. However, practically, the second statement has not been a correct statement and is a subject of debates for many years. It was in 2004 when Supreme Court had issued notices to the Centre, Election Commission and six national political parties including Congress and BJP on a PIL seeking derecognising of parties with religion in their name in violation of Constitution's \\\"secular\\\" provisions. A Bench comprising Chief Justice R C Lahoti and Justice G P Mathur had also issued notices to 22 political parties including Indian Union of Muslim League (IUML), Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasaba (ABHM), All India Christian Democratic and Backward People's Party, Rashtriya Hindu Mahasabha and Akali Dal. What happened to that PIL is not known."
