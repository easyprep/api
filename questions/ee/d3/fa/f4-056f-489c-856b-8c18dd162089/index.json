  "question": "Crystals of which of the following naturally-occuring substance exhibits both ‘pyroelectric’ and ‘piezoelectric’ properties making it versatile for application in the field of electronics?",
  "option1": "Quartz",
  "option2": "Mica",
  "option3": "Topaz",
  "option4": "grapite",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Quartz",
  "explanation": "Quartz crystals have piezoelectric properties: they develop an electric potential upon the application of mechanical stress. An early use of this property of quartz crystals was in phonograph pickups. A common piezoelectric use of quartz today is as a crystal oscillator. The quartz clock is a familiar device using the mineral. Quartz is also strongly pyroelectric. Temperature changes create positive and negative charges within the crystal."
