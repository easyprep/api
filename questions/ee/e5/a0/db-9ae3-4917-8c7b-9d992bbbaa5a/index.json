  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nWMO is a specialised agency under the United Nations. A specialised agency is an autonomous organisation that was not necessarily created by the UN. Agencies like the WMO were created independently and later incorporated with the UN. It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nIndia is a member of the WMOâ€™s Asia region. The WMO has 193 member states and territories.
