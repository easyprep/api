Their function is to carry out business of acquisition of securities and shares. In November, the Tapan Ray Committee constituted by the RBI recommended the tightening of corporate governance norms.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Tapan Ray Committee recommended retaining the current minimum asset size of 100 crore INR for the CICs.
