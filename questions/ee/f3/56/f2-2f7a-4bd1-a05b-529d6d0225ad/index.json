  "question": "In the second half of 2019, India's Chandrayaan-II was making news for relaying pictures of the Mitra Crater on moon to Earth. In this context, consider the following statements about Moon's Craters:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Moon craters were formed due to volcanic activity.</li>\r\n<li>Moon craters are named by International Astronomical Union.</li>\r\n<li>Moon craters are highly eroded.</li>\r\n<li>The South Pole-Aitken Basin is an impact crater.Â </li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above is / are correct observations?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 1, 3 and 4 are correct",
  "option4": "Only 1, 2 and 4 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1, 2 and 4 are correct",
  "explanation": "Craters are depressions in the landscape. The moon's topography is characterized by numerous craters which are the results of two main activities: cratering and volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on the moon had ceased in the distant past. NASA studies report that the most recent lava activity on the moon was about 100 million years ago.The naming of crater is done by the International Astronomical Union. Its Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature is the deciding authority when it comes to naming. The names are suggested by a task force and decided on by means of voting. The Mitra Crater is located at the North Pole. It was named after Indian scientist Sisir Kumar Mitra. The lunar atmosphere is very rare i.e. airless and hence the craters are not subject to much erosion. The character of lunar tectonics and the lack of other weathering agents like water contributes to preservation of the lunar landscape. The craters on the surface were found to be as old as 2 billion years. The study of these craters will help in understanding the process of the moon's formation.The South Pole-Aitken Basin is an impact crater. Impact craters are formed when a space object crashes into a massive celestial body like a planet or moon. The impact craters can be created by meteorite crashes. The South Pole Aitken Basin is the largest crater on lunar surface. It has a diameter of about 2,500km and was formed early in the life of the moon."
