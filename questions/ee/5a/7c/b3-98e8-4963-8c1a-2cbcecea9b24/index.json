  "answer": "I Love Sparrows",
  "explanation": "The World Sparrow Day (WSD) is observed every year on 20th of March to protect these little birds and conserve their houses.  The house sparrow is on the verge of extinction. The 2019 theme \\\"I Love Sparrows\\\" is inspired by hope that more and more will celebrate the relationship between People and Sparrows. The initiative was started by Nature Forever Society (NFS) of India, founded by Mohammed Dilawar, an Indian conservationist. He started his work helping the house sparrow in Nashik. He was also named one of the \\\"Heroes of the Environment\\\" for 2008 by Time for his efforts.  The idea of marking WSD came up during an informal discussion at the NFSâ€™s office. The idea was to earmark a day for the house sparrow to convey the message of conservation of the house sparrow and other common birds and also mark a day of celebration to appreciate the beauty of the common biodiversity which is taken so much for granted. The first WSD was celebrated in 2010 in different parts of the world. To encourage efforts made towards this cause and to selflessly conserve the environment, NFS has instituted the first Sparrow Awards in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, on 20 March 2011."
