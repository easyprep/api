  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct?<br />1. Himalayan rivers have their origin in the snow-covered areas, hence they are dry in the winter season<br />2. Rivers of the Peninsular Plateau have reached maturity<br />3. Himalayan rivers depict all the three stages of the normal cycle of erosion<br />Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 only",
  "option2": "2 only",
  "option3": "1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 only",
  "explanation": "Himalayan rivers that originated from snow-covered areas receive water even in the dry season due to snowmelt and are perennial. On the other hand, rivers of the peninsular plateau are only rain-fed water and the quantity of water carried by them decreases during the summer. Moreover, the rivers of the Peninsular plateau have reached maturity whereas the rivers of the Himalayan region are young. While Himalayan rivers cause much erosion and have a great flow of water, peninsular rivers are mature and create much less erosion and also have a weaker flow of water.</span>"
