  "option2": "Wheat",
  "option3": "Pea",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Pea",
  "explanation": "Nitrogen fixing plants don\\'t pull nitrogen from the air on their own. They actually need help from a common bacteria called Rhizobium. The bacteria infect legume plants such as peas and beans and use the plant to help it draw nitrogen from the air."
