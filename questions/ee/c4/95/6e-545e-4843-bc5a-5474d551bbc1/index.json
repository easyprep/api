  "question": "The government had launched the Emission Trading Scheme in Surat. With reference to this, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It allows trading in particulate matter emission.</li>\n<li>It is a cap and trade market.</li>\n<li>Hoarding of permits is not allowed.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "All are incorrect",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe ETS or Emission Trading Scheme was introduced in Surat in light of its deteriorating air quality. The scheme provides a market for trading permits for particulate matter emission. This is the first such market in the world. The cost of bidding for permits will incentivise factories to install air pollution control mechanisms.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:        </strong>\nThe ETS market is also called a cap-and-trade market. Cap-and-trade is a market regulatory mechanism used by the government to curb the emission of a certain chemical or pollutant. It is an alternative to outright taxation of emissions like the carbon tax. It is used to bring in eco-friendly practices without affecting the economy to a large degree.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nThe ETS prevents hoarding of permits by imposing a limit. The upper limit stands at 3% of market cap for the compliance period or one and a half times the initial allocation for the compliance period. It also mandates that no factory/ industry can sell more than 90% of its initial allocation."
