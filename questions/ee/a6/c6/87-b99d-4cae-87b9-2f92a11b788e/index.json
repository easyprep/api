  "explanation": "Eswatini, previously known as Swaziland and officially known as the Kingdom of Eswatini is an absolute monarchy country in Southern Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the northeast and South Africa to the north, west, and south. In 2018, during the golden jubilee celebrations of the 50th anniversary of Swazi independence, the country name got changed from Swaziland to Eswatini. Mbabane is the capital of Eswatini, while Lobamba is the traditional, spiritual and legislative capital of Eswatini. The parliament name of Eswatini is \"Libandla\", which is a bicameral parliament. The currency of Eswatini is \"Lilangeni\", which is issued by the central bank of Eswatini. House of Dlamini is the ruling royal house of the Kingdom of Eswatini in which Mswati III is the king and Ngwenyama of Eswatini and current head of the House of Dlamini \"Ngwenyama\" and \"Ndlovukati\" are the royal titles of Eswatini which represent the male ruler/King and female ruler/Queen Mother (if the king lives) of Eswatini respectively. Therefore Eswatini remains Africa's last remaining absolute monarchy."
