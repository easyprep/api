  "explanation": "Recently, the government has launched Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojna, named “Saubhagya”. The estimated cost for the scheme is Rs 16, 320 crore. The objective of the ‘Saubhagya’ is to provide energy access to all by last mile connectivity and electricity connections to all remaining un-electrified households in rural as well as urban areas to achieve universal household electrification in the country by December 2018. It will help reduce the use of kerosene lamps in non-electrified households. The scheme is being funded to the extent of 60% by central grants, 30% by bank loans and 10% by states. Projects under the scheme would be sanctioned based on the Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) to be submitted by the States. There is no upfront allocation of fund under the scheme. Under the scheme, electricity connections will be given free to people identified by the Socio Economic and Caste Census of 2011 while others will get it for Rs 500, payable in 10 instalments in the bill. <em>The Rural Electrification Corp</em> will be the nodal agency for the implementation of the scheme throughout the country while public institutions and panchayats will be authorised to collect applications forms, distribute bills and collect payments in consultation with panchayati raj institutions and urban local bodies."
