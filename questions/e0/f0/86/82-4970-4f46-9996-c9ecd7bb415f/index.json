  "question": "Why does water pipes in hilly areas often burst on a cold frosty night?",
  "option1": "water in the pipes freezes and on freezing water expands, so pipes break",
  "option2": "the material of which pipes are made contracts due to cold and so breaks",
  "option3": "frost makes the pipes rusty, so they break",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "water in the pipes freezes and on freezing water expands, so pipes break",
  "explanation": "Water pipes burst because the water inside them expands is it gets close to freezing, and this causes an increase in pressure inside thepipe. This happens with water too, and whenwater is cooled down, it gets denser and denser, down to 3.98Â°C then, something interesting occurs, it starts to expand again."
