  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The term dvija was now beginning to be used increasingly for the brahmans. The greater the emphasis on brahman purity, the greater was the stress laid on the impurity of the outcaste. Fa Hsien refers to the fear of pollution by approach, that is, if an outcaste was even so much as seen at close range by a dvija, the latter had to perform a ritual ablution to purify himself. This was in keeping with the regulations laid down in legal code.<br />Dvija is a male member of the first three varnas in Brahmanical Hindu society: the Brahmins, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas are included in the Dvija category. The ancient Asvalayana sutra indicates that a non-dvija child may also be inducted into the Dvija category, if he wishes to pursue the duties associated with these varnas."
