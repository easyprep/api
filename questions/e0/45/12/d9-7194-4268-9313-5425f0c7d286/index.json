  "answer": "Hear their voices",
  "explanation": "The World Hemophilia Day (WHD) is observed every year on April 17 to improve and sustain care for people with inherited bleeding disorders around the world. The 2017 World Hemophilia Day theme is “Hear Their Voices” to unite the community and show support for the millions of people affected by bleeding disorders. Hemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder in which a person lacks or has low levels of certain proteins called “clotting factors” and as a result, the blood doesn’t clot properly. Clotting factor is a protein in blood that controls bleeding. If you have hemophilia, you may bleed for a longer time after an injury than you would if your blood clotted normally. Hemophilia is quite rare. About 1 in 10,000 people are born with it."
