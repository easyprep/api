  "answer": 1942,
  "explanation": "After the meager August Offer-1940, Subhash Chandra Bose advocated a campaign of mass civil disobedience to protest Viceroy Linlithgow's decision to declare war on India's behalf without consulting the Congress. Failing to persuade Gandhi or the Congress, he organised mass protests in Calcutta, and was arrested in July 1940. Released after a 7-day hunger strike, his house was put under CID-surveillance. However, in a daredevil act, Bose managed to escaped on 19 January 1941 along with his nephew Sisir Bose. Remaining incognito, he reached Germany via Afghanistan, Russia and Italy. Indians heard Bose after one year, in March 1942 over Radio Berlin. It was that time that Azad Hind Radio service was started under Subhash Chandra Bose in Germany in 1942 to encourage Indians to fight for freedom. Though initially based in Germany, its headquarters were shifted to Singapore, and later to Rangoon, following the course of the war in Southeast Asia. After Netaji's departure to Southeast Asia, the German operations were continued by A.C.N. Nambiar, the head of the Indian Legion in Germany and later ambassador of the Arzi Hukumate Azad Hind in Germany."
