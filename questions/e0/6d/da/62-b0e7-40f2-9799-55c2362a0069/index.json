  "answer": 1945,
  "explanation": "In the year 1945, Indonesia was declared independent from the Netherlands. In 1602, the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and became the dominant European power for almost 200 years. Only in the early 20th century did the Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia's current boundaries. The Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation during World War II ended Dutch rule and encouraged the previously suppressed independence movement. Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta, influential nationalist leaders, proclaimed Indonesian independence and were appointed president and vice-president respectively.",
