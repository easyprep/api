  "question": "In relation to the parliamentary provision of a whip, which of the following statements are correct?\n<ol>\n<li>All political parties in India can issue whips.</li>\n<li>Defiance of a Whip is not subject to disqualification from the house.</li>\n<li>Defiance of a whip will not result in disqualification, only if condoned by the party.</li>\n<li>All whip orders are equally important</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "option3": "Only 1, 2 & 4",
  "option4": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nWhip is an order or directive that is issued by the party to its legislators to be present for a vote or to vote in a particular way. All Indian political parties can issue whips. The power of issuing whips is bestowed on a senior member of the party- called the “Chief Whip”. The Chief Whip is assisted by assistant whips.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nA whip issued by a party may result in disqualification of an MLA from the house. However, this is true only if the whip issued is sufficiently important. Eg: One line whips, informing members about a vote, may allow them to abstain if they decide not to take the party’s stand. In case of whips of lower importance, the party may condone the member for not following the directive. Other countries where whip system is used provide for different penalties. Eg: UK: loss of party membership but not disqualified from the House.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nDisqualification for not following the party whip is provided for under the X schedule of the constitution- also known as the anti-defection law. If a member defies a three line whip, the disqualification risk arises. If the defiance against a whip is not condoned by the party, the Speaker may consider the disqualification of the MLA. However, if more than 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the party MLAs had defied the whip- leading to a split- it will not lead to disqualification.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe importance of whip is understood by the number of times the directive is underlined. A one-lined whip is the least important. It informs the members to about a vote and they can chose to abstain from voting. Two lined whip is more important. It includes directives like asking them to be present for voting. The most important is the three lined whip. It gives orders like no-confidence motion, second reading of a bill, etc."
