  "question": "In light of RBIâ€™s annual report on state budgets, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The states spend more than the centre.</li>\n<li>The states are meeting their fiscal deficit target due to increase in tax revenues.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe states spend about one and a half times more than the centre and hence the state budget is of significance to the GDP. The states have reduced their spending this time around to meet the fiscal deficits. The states are also more important as employment generators.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe RBI report showed that most states were able to reach their fiscal deficit targets. This was not due to higher revenue collection. Rather, it was due to increased borrowing of the governments from the market combined with reduced spending."
