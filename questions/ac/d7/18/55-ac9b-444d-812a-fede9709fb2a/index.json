  "question": "Which among the following belts is also called as Horse Latitudes?",
  "option1": "Equatorial Low Pressure Belt",
  "option2": "Sub-Tropical High Pressure Belt",
  "option3": "Sub-Polar Low Pressure Belt",
  "option4": "Polar High Pressure Belt",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Sub-Tropical High Pressure Belt",
  "explanation": "The Sub Tropical High Pressure Belt extend near the tropics to about 35 degree North and South Latitudes. The high pressure along this belt is due to subsidence of air coming from the equatorial region which descends after becoming heavy. In early days, the sailing vessels with cargo of horses found it difficult to sail under calm conditions of this high pressure belt.They used to throw horses into the sea when fodder ran out. Hence the name horse latitudes."
