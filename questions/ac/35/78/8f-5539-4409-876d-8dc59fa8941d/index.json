  "question": "In which of the following respects, the ultra-violet radiations are similar to white light?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Both obey the laws of reflection and refraction</li>\r\n<li>Both travel with same speed in vacuum</li>\r\n<li>Both are equally active chemically</li>\r\n<li>Both are scattered equally</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Both obey the laws of reflection.<br />Both obey the laws of refraction.<br />Both travel with the speed of 3 × 108 ms–1.<br />Ultraviolet waves get readily scattered as compared to visible light<br />Ultraviolet waves are chemically more active than visible light"
