  "option2": "directly proportional to the square of the distance r between the poles",
  "option3": "Both a and b",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "directly proportional to the square of the distance r between the poles",
  "explanation": "As per coulomb's law, the force of interaction between two poles of a magnet is directly proportional to the product of the pole strength and inversely proportional to the square of the distance r between them."
