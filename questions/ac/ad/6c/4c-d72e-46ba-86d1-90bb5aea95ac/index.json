  "question": "Fire akin to water, has played a major role in Indus Valley Culture. From which among the following sites fire altars were uncovered as ritual installations involving probable religious activity related to fire?",
  "option1": "Surkotda",
  "option2": "Kalibangan",
  "option3": "Harappa",
  "option4": "Rakhigarhi",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Kalibangan",
  "explanation": "Fire, an element of almost equal importance to water, has also played a major role in Indian religion, as an agent of ritual purification and as a means of transmitting offerings to the gods. While water seems to have had a religious significance throughout the Harappan realms, ritual installations involving fire are at present known only from the southern parts, along the Saraswati and in Gujarat. These fire altars were first uncovered at Kalibangan, where one of the platforms in the southern part of the citadel had a row of seven oblong clay-lined pits containing charcoal, ash, and terra-cotta cakes; such cakes were used in kilns to retain heat and perhaps had a similar function in these fire pits. In each pit there was also a cylindrical or faceted clay stele, perhaps representing the lingam (sacred phallus)"
