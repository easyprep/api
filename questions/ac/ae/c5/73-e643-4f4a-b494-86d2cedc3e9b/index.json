  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2, 3 & 4 Only",
  "explanation": "Wildlife laws divide species into “schedules” ranked from I to V. Schedule I members are the best-protected species, in theory, with severe punishments meted out to those who hunt them. On the other hand, few other fauna have been listed under the Schedule 5 of the act and have been declared vermin, therefore, can be hunted. Animals listed under the Schedule-V of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 are Common crow, Mice, Common Fox, Rats, Fruit bats, Voles &amp; Jackals. Dugong is listed under Schedule-I of the Act."
