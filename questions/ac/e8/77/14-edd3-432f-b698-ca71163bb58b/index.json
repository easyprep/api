  "option2": "3 only",
  "option3": "2 only",
  "option4": "1 only",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 only",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe ENDS/ electronic delivery of nicotine system is a class of product that includes the e-cigarette. But it is not included under the COTPA, 2003 as it does not contain tobacco per ser. The 2003 act prohibits advertisement and regulates production and trade of tobacco related products.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nENDS contain nicotine. Nicotine, an active ingredient of tobacco, is a plant based toxic noted for its ill effects on the nervous system. It is also a noted promoter of tumours. The ENDS products contain nicotine along with other components like glycerine and glycols to enable tobacco like smoke emission.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nFollowing various reports like the WHO report on ENDS and also the advisory from the Health ministry, several states have banned the products. Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Mizoram and J&amp;K are among the 15 states that have banned ENDS. However, the bans are under other acts like Poisons act and the Drugs and Cosmetics act."
