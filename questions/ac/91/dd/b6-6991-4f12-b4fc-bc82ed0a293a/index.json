  "question": "A network that is connected to the Internet, but uses encryption to scramble all the data sent through the Internet is called ?",
  "option1": "My network",
  "option2": "Virtual Private Network",
  "option3": "Social Network",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Virtual Private Network",
  "explanation": "A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network, and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Applications running on a computing device, e.g., a laptop, desktop, smartphone, across a VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network. Encryption is a common, though not an inherent, part of a VPN connection."
