  "option1": "Egypt",
  "option2": "Iran",
  "option3": "Israel",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Egypt",
  "explanation": "Mohamed Morsi (67), the former President of Egypt, has passed away in Cairo on June 17 after collapsing during his court trial that charged him of espionage and inciting violence. He was the first democratically-elected President of Egypt. His death has raised doubts over the ‘torturous’ condition under which he was kept in prison. Voices of several human right groups and individuals have called for an impartial investigation into his death.  Morsi was democratically elected in 2012, a year after the uprising that ended the rule of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak. The military toppled Morsi in the following year after massive protests and crushed the Brotherhood in a major crackdown."
