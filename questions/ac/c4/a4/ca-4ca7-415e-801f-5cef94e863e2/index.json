  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nTamil Nadu had historical ties with the Chinese not only during the Pallava period, but also during the subsequent Chola period. Some Pallava kings sent missions to the Tang Court while the Chola kings sent trade missions to the Song Court.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe title ‘huaide jun’ means ‘the army that cherishes virtue’. It was given by the Chinese to the troops of Pallava king Narasimhavarman II. This was given by Chinese emperor Xuangzong in recognition of the Pallava king’s offer to form ties against Arabs and Tibetans.\n&nbsp;"
