  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Denmark Strait Cataract",
  "explanation": "Denmark Strait Cataract is the world's largest/highest underwater waterfall. It is located in the Atlantic Ocean beneath the Denmark Strait, a strait located between Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, and Canada. The height of the Denmark Strait Cataract is 11500 feet. In the Denmark Strait, southward-flowing frigid water from the Nordic Seas meets warmer water from the Irminger Sea. The cold, dense water quickly sinks below the warmer water and flows over the huge drop in the ocean floor creating a downward flow estimated over 123 million cubic feet per second."
