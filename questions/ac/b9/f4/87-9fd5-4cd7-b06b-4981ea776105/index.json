  "question": "With regards to the recent ban imposed by Palau on sunscreens, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It was to protect the coral reefs.</li>\r\n<li>It is the first country in the world to impose this ban.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe Palau government imposed a ban on sunscreen to protect the coral reef. The chemicals in the sunscreen products, like oxybenzone, octocylene, 4-methyl-benzylidene camphor and parabens and triclosan are known to affect the health of corals. The stores in the country, however, sell ‘reef safe’ sunscreens which are devoid of these chemicals.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe Palau state became the first in the world to ban reef toxic sunscreen for protection of its coral reefs. The decision was taken based on a 2017 UNESCO report which recommended banning sunscreen in and near iconic marine lakes."
