  "answer": 0.4,
  "explanation": "20% of A = 50% of B\r\n$latex => 2A = 5B$\r\n$latex => A = \\\\frac{5B}{2}&s=1$\r\nLet B is x% of A.\r\n$latex \\\\therefore \\\\frac{5B}{2}\\\\times \\\\frac{x}{100} = B&s=1$\r\n$latex => x = \\\\frac{200}{5} = 40\\\\%&s=1$\r\nHence option [D] is the correct answer."
