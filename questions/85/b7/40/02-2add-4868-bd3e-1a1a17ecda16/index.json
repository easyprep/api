  "explanation": "PARIVESH stands for -Pro Active Responsive facilitation by Interactive and Virtuous Environmental Single window Hub. Statement 1 is incorrect: Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change will be the nodal body to implement the scheme and provide clearances online through a management of proposals submitted by Project Proponents to the MOEFCC, as well as to the State Level Environmental Impact Assessment Authorities (SEIAA). Statement 2 is correct: The scheme would seek various types of clearances (e.g. Environment, Forest, Wildlife and Coastal Regulation Zone Clearances) from Central, State and district-level authorities. PARIVESH enables project proponents, citizens to view, track and interact with scrutiny officers, generates online clearance letters, online mailers and alerts to state functionaries in case of delays beyond stipulated time for processing of applications."
