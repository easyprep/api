  "question": "Which of the following will become the first e-commerce company to take membership of the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI)?",
  "option1": "FreeCharge",
  "option2": "Amazon",
  "option3": "Paytm",
  "option4": "Clear trip",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Paytm",
  "explanation": "Paytm will become the first e-commerce company to take membership of the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) in April 2017.  The move is significant because advertising violations by e-commerce companies, which are big spenders on television, print and digital media, have been on the rise in recent years.  This move comes after the six complaints which are filed against the errant advertisers under the e-commerce majors PAYTM, Amazon, Clear trip, Magic bricks, free charge and Pepper fry for making false and misleading claims on November 2016."
