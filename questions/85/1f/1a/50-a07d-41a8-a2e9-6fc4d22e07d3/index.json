  "answer": "Goa",
  "explanation": "The Shigmotsav is the biggest festival for the Hindus in Goa, which is celebrated in the month of Phalguna (March) from the 9th moon day to full moon day as per the Hindu calendar. The 5th day is called \\'Rang Panchami\\'. This day of rejoicing is celebrated with the abundant use of \\'Gulal\\' or red powder. This year, in 2018, the 2-week long festival has started from March 3. The Shigmotsav or Shigmo is one of the several cultural festivals of the coastal state and is celebrated through colours, costumes, music, dance and parades. The Shigmo parades will give one and all a chance to take a glimpse at the life of a Goan which is depicted in elaborate folk performances by local men and women who dance tirelessly in huge processions along with the parade. Folk dances like Ghode Modni and Fugdi will be performed on the streets in massive troupes along the procession, showcasing the traditions of Goa."
