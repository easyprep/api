  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Venezuela and Guyana",
  "explanation": "Venezuela and Guyana are the basin countries of the \"Kamarang River\". Kamarang River is a river in Venezuela and Guyana, and a part of the Essequibo River basin. The river originates in Venezuela. Its source is located right next to the Troncal 10, in the middle of the Gran Sabana region. The nascent river first flows in parallel to the road in a southeasterly direction. Here the river forms the Kamoiran rapids. Its course then turns more eastward for several kilometres through open Savannah. Shortly after entering the disputed Guayana Esequiba territory in Guyana, the river drops roughly 160 meters at the impressive Kamarang falls creating a 40-meter wide water curtain.",
