  "question": "Which of the following pairs is/are correct?<br />(A) Main root — Storage<br />(B) Lateral root — Absorption<br />(C) Root hair — Conduction",
  "option1": "only A",
  "option2": "A and C",
  "option3": "All are correct",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "only A",
  "explanation": "Lateral roots extend horizontally from the primary root and serve to anchor the plant securely into the soil. This branching of roots also contributes to water uptake, and facilitates the extraction of nutrients required for the growth and development of the plant.<br />The function of root hairs is to collect water and mineral nutrients present in the soil and take this solution up through the roots to the rest of the plant. As root hair cells do not carry out photosynthesis, they do not contain chloroplasts."
