  "question": "&nbsp; &nbsp; Consider the following differences between Anabatic and Katabatic winds: <ol> <li>While anabatic winds are known as upslope winds, katabatic winds are known as down-slope winds</li> <li>While Bora is an example of katabatic wind, Berg is an example for&nbsp;anabatic wind</li> </ol> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "Anabatic wind is a warm wind which blows up a steep slope or mountain&nbsp;side. Katabatic wind carries high density air from a higher elevation down a slope under the force of gravity. Both Berg and Bora are katabatic winds."
