  "question": "Consider the following:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Asteroid Belt</li>\r\n<li>Kuiper Belt</li>\r\n<li>Oort Cloud</li>\r\n<li>Farout</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the following is the correct sequence of their increasing distance from Sun?",
  "option1": "1, 2, 3, 4",
  "option2": "1, 3, 2, 4",
  "option3": "2, 1, 3, 4",
  "option4": "3, 1, 2, 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3, 4",
  "explanation": "The Kuiper Belt is a doughnut-shaped ring, extending just beyond the orbit of Neptune from about 30 to 55 AU. The Oort Cloud is a spherical shell, occupying space at a distance between five thousand and 100 thousand AU. Thus, both of them are beyond the orbit of Neptune.  Farout ( 2018 VG18) is the farthest known object in solar system."
