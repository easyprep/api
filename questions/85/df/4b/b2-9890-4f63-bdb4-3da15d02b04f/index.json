  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "It is mandatory under the Motor Vehicles Act 1988 to get your car insured as soon as you purchase it.There are two types of car insurance: &#8216;Third Party Insurance&#8217; and &#8216;Comprehensive Insurance&#8217;. Third party insurance protects a policy holder against losses which arise due to bodily injury/death to a third party or any damage to its property. It is mandatory by law to have third party insurance. However this insurance doesn&#8217;t protect you against losses which arise due to bodily injury/death to you, your vehicle and co-passengers. If you want to be compensated for any damages to you, your co-passengers and your vehicle in addition to third party coverage, then purchase comprehensive car insurance. Comprehensive car policy is better as it provides both third party coverage and damages/loss to one&#8217;s own vehicle, co-passengers or self."
