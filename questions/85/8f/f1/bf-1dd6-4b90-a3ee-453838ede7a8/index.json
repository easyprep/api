  "question": "Which country is the highest recipient of remittances in 2017, as per World Bank (WB)'s latest report \"Migration and Development Brief\"?",
  "option1": "India",
  "option2": "Mexico",
  "option3": "China",
  "option4": "Philippines",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "India",
  "explanation": "As per World Bank (WB)\\'s latest report \\\"Migration and Development Brief\\\", India is the highest recipient of remittances globally in 2017 with $69 billion, followed by China ($64 billion), the Philippines ($33 billion), Mexico ($31 billion), Nigeria ($22 billion), and Egypt ($20 billion). In its report, the World Bank estimated that officially recorded remittances to low-and middle-income countries reached USD 466 billion in 2017. This was an increase of 8.5% over USD 429 billion in 2016. Remittances are expected to continue to increase in 2018, by 4.1% to reach $485 billion. Global remittances are expected to grow 4.6% to $642 billion in 2018. As per report, the longer-term risks to growth of remittances include stricter immigration policies in many remittance-source countries. Also, de-risking by banks and increased regulation of money transfer operators, both aimed at reducing financial crime, continue to constrain the growth of formal remittances."
