  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nIndia is party to the International Court of Justice. All members of the United Nations are party to the ICJ. The ICJ is the highest judicial organ of the UN. Unlike the ICC, the ICJ do not take up cases against individuals. It is concerned with dispute resolution between states.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nIndia is not party to the International Criminal Court. India is not signatory to the Rome Statute. The Rome Statute led to the establishment of the ICC in 2002. The ICC has jurisdiction over cases only in states that are party to the Rome Statute."
