  "answer": "2 only",
  "explanation": "Adopt a Heritage: Apni Dharohar, Apni Pehchaan”, is a collaborative effort between the Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Culture and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), and State/UTs Governments. The Project aims to develop synergy among all partners to effectively promote “responsible tourism”. Under this initiative government will assign the heritages to companies after a process of Vision Bidding. Statement 1 is incorrect – Under ‘Vision Bidding’ the bidders need to do detail existing situation analysis and vision development for each and every individual monument or heritage site that they are interested in adopting. Statement 2 is correct - A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) will be signed between Monument Mitra, Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Culture, Archaeological Survey of India and the concerned stakeholder from state. The MoU will be entered initially for a period of 2 years and there would be a provision of extension up to 5 years on the basis of the performance, capacity and various feedbacks received at the heritage sites."
