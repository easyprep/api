This canal transfers water from the Irtysh River into several dry and endorheic basins of the north-central Xinjiang. The excess water of Burqin River, a tributary of Irtysh River, which usually flows into the Arctic Ocean, can be transferred for the irrigation and general use in water-scarce areas."
