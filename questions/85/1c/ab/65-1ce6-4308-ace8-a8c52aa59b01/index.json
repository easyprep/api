  "explanation": "2015 National Games were held using Green Protocols. The 2015 National Games was associated with green protocols. This was initiated by Suchitwa Mission, aiming for \"zero-waste\" venues. Waste Management programmes were implemented at all 29 venues. To make the event \"disposable-free\", a ban on the use of disposable water bottles was enforced. The event witnessed the usage of reusable tableware and stainless steel tumblers. Athletes were provided with refillable steel flasks. It is estimated that these green practices prevented the generation of about 120 metric tonnes of disposable waste. Suchitwa Mission requested the help of volunteers to achieve the green objectives."
