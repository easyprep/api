  "question": "A train 200 m long running at 36 km/hr takes 55 seconds to cross a bridge. The length of the bridge is :",
  "option1": "300 m",
  "option2": "325 m",
  "option3": "350 m",
  "option4": "375 m",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "350 m",
  "explanation": "Speed of train = 36 km/hr\r\n$latex = 36\\\\times \\\\frac{5}{18} = 10\\\\ m/sec.&s=1$\r\nIf the length of the bridge be x metre, then\r\n$latex 10 = \\\\frac{200+x}{55}&s=1$\r\n$latex => 200+x = 550$\r\n$latex => x = 550-200 = 350\\\\ metre$\r\nHence option [C] is correct answer."
