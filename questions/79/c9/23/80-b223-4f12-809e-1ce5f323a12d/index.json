  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "It is correct to say that UNGA resolutions are legally non-binding upon member nations but saying that UNSC Resolutions are legally binding upon all members, is incorrect. This is because the UNSC resolutions are of two kinds taken as per chapter VI and VII of the UN Charter which correspond to nonbinding and binding resolutions. It is correct to say that UNGA resolutions are sponsored by any member, however, again it is incorrect to say that UNSC Resolutions are sponsored by only permanent members"
