To achieve this, GoI on November 11, 2019 removed price restriction on locally produced oil and natural gas.<br />The move was suggested by the Kelkar Panel.

Kelkar Panel was set up by the Petroleum Ministry to boost domestic production of oil and gas and to help India achieve energy security. It was set up in 2013 under the Finance secretary Vijay Kelkar. The Kelkar Committee submitted its report in 2013"
