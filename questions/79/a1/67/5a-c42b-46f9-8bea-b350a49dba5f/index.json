  "question": "Which of the following are the Micro-elements needed to increase soil fertility?",
  "option1": "Nitrogen, hydrogen and calcium",
  "option2": "Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium",
  "option3": "Iron, calcium and potassium",
  "option4": "Manganese, copper and zinc",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Manganese, copper and zinc",
  "explanation": "In relatively large amounts, the soil supplies nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur; these are often called the macronutrients. In relatively small amounts, the soil supplies iron, manganese, boron, molybdenum, copper, zinc, chlorine, and cobalt, the so-called micronutrients. So we use fertilizers to increase the soil fertility."
