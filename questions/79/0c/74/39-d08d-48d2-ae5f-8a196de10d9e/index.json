Since its inception in 1960, the BRO has grown from 02 to 19 projects. The works executed have ensured the territorial integrity and the socio-economic upliftment of the most inaccessible regions of the country as well as Indiaâ€™s neighbourhood. Currently, the organisation maintains operations in 21 states, one UT (Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands), and neighbouring countries such as Afghanistan, Bhutan, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka. The BRO operates and maintains over 32,885 km of roads and about 12,200m of permanent bridges in the country. Presently, BRO is also involved in the construction of a tunnel at the Rohtang pass which is estimated to be ready by 2019. It is currently headed by Lt General SK Shrivastava who is the 25th Director General Border Roads (DGBR)."
