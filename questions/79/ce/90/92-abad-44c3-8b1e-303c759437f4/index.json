  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe ministry of chemicals and fertiliser recently launched the ‘Apna Urea Sona Ugle’ brand. This is for use by HURL (Hindustan Urvarak and Rasayan Ltd). The HURL is a joint venture by IOCL, NTPC Ltd and Coal India Ltd which are all Maharatna companies.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe brand was launched to revive 3 fertiliser plants in Barauni, Sindri and Gorakhpur. The plants are to produce neem-coated urea among other products. The neem coating is to inhibit the nitrification process of the urea. This will ensure sustainable release of nutrients for the crops."
