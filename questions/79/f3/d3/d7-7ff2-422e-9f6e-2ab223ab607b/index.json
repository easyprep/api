  "answer": "1, 2 & 3 Only",
  "explanation": "Tathagat is a&nbsp;Pali&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sanskrit&nbsp;word;&nbsp;Gautama Buddha&nbsp;uses it when referring to himself. Tathagat is one who attained the truth. Syadvada is associated to Jainism. It states that all judgments are conditional, holding good only in certain conditions &amp; circumstances. Upasaka (masculine) and&nbsp;Upasikas&nbsp;(feminine) were the titles given to followers of the Buddha who undertook certain vows, but were not monks, nuns, or monastics. Gautama Buddha left his family to become a ascetic in&nbsp;search of truth. This is called &ldquo;the great departure&#039; or&nbsp;Mahabhinishkramana."
