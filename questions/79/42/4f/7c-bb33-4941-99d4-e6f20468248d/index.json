  "question": "Which of the following is correct about the properties of a solution?",
  "option1": "The particles of a solution can be seen by naked eyes",
  "option2": "The particles of a solution scatter a beam of light passing through the solution",
  "option3": "The solute particles do not settle down when left undisturbed",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "The solute particles do not settle down when left undisturbed",
  "explanation": "The particles of a solution are smaller than 1 nm in diameter. So, they cannot be seen by naked eyes. Because of very small particle size, they do not scatter a beam of light passing through the solution. The solute particles do not settle down when left undisturbed, that is, a solution is stable."
