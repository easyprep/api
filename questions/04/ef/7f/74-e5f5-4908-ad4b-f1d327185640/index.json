  "question": "Consider the following comparisons of Arctic Tundra and Antarctic Tundra:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>There are no mammalian fauna in Antarctic Tundra, while they are plenty in Arctic Tundra</li>\r\n<li>Antarctic Tundra has more extreme temperatures in winters in comparison to Arctic Tundra</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above is / are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "The major difference between Arctic Tundra and Antarctic Tundra is that Antarctic Tundra lacks a large mammal fauna, while in Arctic Tundra we find an array of mammals. The reason is that Antarctica is physically isolated from other continents. However, it is not correct to say that the antarctica has no mammals aty all. Its shores are inhabitated by Sea mammals and sea birds, including seals, walruses and penguins. Further, some small mammals, like rabbits and cats, have been introduced by humans to some of the subantarctic islands."
