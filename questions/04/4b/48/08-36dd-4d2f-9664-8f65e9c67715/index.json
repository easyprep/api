  "question": "Kerala had recorded its highest level of alcohol consumption in September. In that context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Kerala has the highest per capita consumption of alcohol.</li>\n<li>Article 48 of the constitution calls for alcohol prohibition.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nKerala has the highest per capita consumption of alcohol among Indian states. The record consumption was due to incidence of the Onam season. 500 crore INR worth of alcohol was consumed in the state during this season. This is despite prohibitive taxes and frequent observation of dry days.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nArticle 47 is a part of the Directive Principles of State Policy. It calls for the states to impose prohibition on alcohol consumption for non-medical uses to maintain the citizensâ€™ health. However DPSP is non-justiciable. However, several states have prohibited alcohol consumption.\n&nbsp;"
