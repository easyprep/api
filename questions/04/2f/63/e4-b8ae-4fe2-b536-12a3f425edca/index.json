  "answer": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The Ganasangha or republics were basically the tribal oligarchies. Important Pre-Maurya Ganasangha were Shakyas of Kapilvastu, Lichachhavis of Vaishali, and Mallas of Kusinagara and Pava etc. which flourished in the middle of first millennium BC. The emergence of the Mauryan Empire marked the end of the ganasanghas in the Terai and north Bihar as they were incorporated in the imperial system. However, such oligarchies of Rajasthan, Punjab and other areas retained much of their identity even in the post-Mauryan period. Malavas, Arjunayana, Audumbara, Trigarta, Abhiras, Vrishni, Shibis, Agastyas and Yaudheyas etc., were the important Ganasangha of Post-Mauryan period. Seat of Vrishni was Dwaraka."
