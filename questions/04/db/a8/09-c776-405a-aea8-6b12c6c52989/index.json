  "option1": "V. Shashank Shekhar committee",
  "option2": "S. Jayaraman committee",
  "option3": "Rina Mitra committee",
  "option4": "Satyendra Garg committee",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Rina Mitra committee",
  "explanation": "The Union Home Ministry has constituted an expert committee to examine methods to curb the misuse of free movement along the Myanmar border. The committee will be headed by Rina Mitra, the special secretary (Internal Security) in the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). The committee will examine the present rules and regulations adopted by the border States for implementation of free movement regime and submit the report within 3 months. Notably, India’s 1,643-km border with Myanmar touches four states — Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram. It is unique in many ways as it has a visa-free movement regime for people living within 16 kms on either side of the border. They can stay up to 72 hours with effective and valid permits issued by the designated authority on either side. However, it is misused by militants and criminals who smuggle weapons, narcotics, contraband goods and fake Indian currency notes (FICN)."
