  "question": "Which of the following observatories has recently accomplished the extremely strenuous job of X-ray polarisation thereby challenging the prevailing theories of high energy radiation from pulsars?",
  "option1": "Hubble Space Telescope",
  "option2": "Astrosat",
  "option3": "Chandra X-ray Observatory",
  "option4": "Kodaikanal Solar Observatory",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Astrosat",
  "explanation": "Astrosat is India's first dedicated multi-wavelength space observatory. It has recently accomplished the extremely strenuous job of X-ray polarisation, putting up a strong challenge to prevailing theories of high energy radiation from pulsars. The 18-month old study of the Crab Pulsar in the Taurus constellation and measurement of the variations of polarisation as this highly-magnetised neutron star spins around 30 times every second is a commendable task. A pulsar is a celestial body, believed to be made up on neutrons, and rotates 30 times per second. Even though they are comparatively tiny in size, they have mass more than that of the entire Sun, and hence are known as compact objects. Scientists and astronomers, who participated in the project hail from the country's top scientific institutes -- the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai; the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram; ISRO Satellite Centre (ISAC), Bengaluru; The Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune; and Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad."
