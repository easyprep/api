  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Odisha",
  "explanation": "Odisha State Cabinet approved long-term bauxite linkage policy that would help Vedanta's Lanjigarh alumina refinery to source bauxite from government-owned Odisha Mining Corporation (OMC). Vedanta, which has invested more than Rs 50000 crore in two smelters, refinery and power plants in Odisha has been facing constraints in ore supply as it has no captive blocks in Odisha. Due to raw material crunch, Vedanta had set a target to produce only 1.25 million tonnes in 2017-18. As per Odisha State Cabinet's decision, 70 per cent of the total production by OMC will now be available for long-term linkage.",
