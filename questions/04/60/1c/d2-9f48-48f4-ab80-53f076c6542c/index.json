  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "<strong>The parliament has enacted a nationwide law on Orphan Drugs</strong> This statement is incorrect. An orphan drug is a pharmaceutical agent that has been developed specifically to treat a rare medical condition, the condition itself being referred to as an orphan disease. These drugs are called “orphan” because under normal market conditions the pharmaceutical industry has little interest in developing and marketing products intended for only a small number of patients. For drug companies, the extremely high cost of bringing a medicinal product to market would not be recovered by the expected sales of the product. As a result the potential market for new drug treatment is also small and the drug companies industry would actually incur a financial loss. As of now, we don't have nationwide policy or law around Orphan drugs. Some states like Karnakata have such laws. <strong>Adopted progressively incremental assurance-based approach in National Health Policy </strong> This is a correct statement and is a feature of National Health Policy. <strong>Enacted a nationwide law on Prevention, Control and Management of Epidemics, Bio-terrorism and Disasters</strong> This is an incorrect statement. This law Public Health (Prevention, Control and Management of Epidemics, Bio-terrorism and Disasters) has been drafted only as of now."
