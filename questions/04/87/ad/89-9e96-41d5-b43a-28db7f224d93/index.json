  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Clayey and loamy soils are both suitable for growing cereals like wheat, and gram. Such soils are good at retaining water.<br />For paddy, soils rich in clay and organic matter and having a good capacity to retain water are ideal.<br />For lentils (masoor) and other pulses, loamy soils, which drain water easily, are required.<br />For cotton, sandy loam or loam, which drain water easily and can hold plenty of air, are more suitable."
