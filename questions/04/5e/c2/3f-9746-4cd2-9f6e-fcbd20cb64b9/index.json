  "option5": "",
  "answer": "G.W.F. Hegel",
  "explanation": "Hegel postulated in his concept of dialectics that the 'idea' or 'consciousness' is the essence of universe and all institutions were the manifestations of the changing forms of ideas. Marx borrowed this concept and combined it with his concept of Materialism and held that it is matter and not the idea that is the essence of the universe, thus, social institutions were the manifestations of the changing material conditions."
