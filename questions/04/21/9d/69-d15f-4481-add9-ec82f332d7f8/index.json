  "question": "Consider the following differences between the Oceanic Crust and Continental Crust:\n<ol>\n<li>The Continental crust is thickerÂ in comparison to the Oceanic Crust</li>\n<li>The Continental crust has more of quartz , while the Oceanic Crust has more of Feldspar</li>\n<li>The Continental Crust is otherwise called SIMA, while the Oceanic Crust is otherwise called SIAL</li>\n<li>The rocks that make the continental crust are little denser than those making Oceanic crust.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "Only 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "<strong>The Continental crust is thicker in comparison to the Oceanic Crust</strong><br />This statement is correct. Continental crust measures between 25 to 100 kilometers, averaging about 30 kilometers thick, while the oceanic crust measures from 5 to 10 kilometers, averaging about 7 kilometers in thickness.\n<strong>The Continental crust has more of quartz , while the Oceanic Crust has more of Feldspar</strong><br />This statement is correct. Continetal crust has more of quartz , while the Oceanic Crust has more of Feldspar\n<strong>The Continental Crust is otherwise called SIMA, while the Oceanic Crust is otherwise called SIAL</strong><br />This statement is incorrect and reverse. The Continental Crust is otherwise called SIAL, while the Oceanic Crust is otherwise called SIMA.\n<strong>The rocks that make the continental crust are little denser than those making Oceanic crust.</strong><br />This statement is incorrect. The rocks which make continental crust are slightly less dense than those making the Oceanic Crust. The less dense rocks such as granite is more common in continental crust than in oceanic crust. Density of Sial is lower than Sima primarily because of the increased amount of aluminium."
