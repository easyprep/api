  "explanation": "The North Sentinel Island (NSI) is home to the Sentinelese tribe, which have consistently refused any interaction with the outside world. They are hostile to outsiders and have killed people who approached or landed on the island. Sentinelese people are believed to be the only pre-Neolithic people in the world. This means they have a culture that existed in the middle period of Stone Age. Their use of metals is not specifically known with many believe that they don\\'t use metals for purposes other than in weapons. The tribe is in news recently because the Minister of State for Home Affairs Hansraj Gangaram Ahir gave information about the tribe in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha.  The tribe is on the verge of extinction as per 2011 census; there are a number of laws/regulations to protect them. These are being strictly implemented and enforced by the UT Administration. These Laws/Regulation include 1) A &N Islands (PAT) Regulation 1956, 2) Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, 3) Restrictions under Foreigner (Restricted Area) Orders, 1963, 4) Visa Manual Conditions/Passport Act 1920, and 5) Indian Forest Act, 1927 and Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The NSI is one of the Andaman Islands, an archipelago in the Bay of Bengal which also includes South Sentinel Island."
