  "question": "In light of recent observations of NASA with regards to J1808, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>J1808 is found in the Sagittarius constellation.</li>\n<li>J1808 is a blackhole.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nJ1808 is located in the constellation Sagittarius. It is about 11,000 light years away from our solar system. Recently, it emitted an intense X-ray burst which was recorded by the NICER telescope of NASA. The energy released by the J1808 in 20 seconds was equivalent to sunâ€™s energy release in 10 days.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe J1808 is a pulsar. It was discovered in 1996. It is a binary star system consisting of a neutron star. It emits X-rays with periodic variations in intensity. A neutron star is the collapsed core of a giant star. They are some of the smallest and densest of stars."
