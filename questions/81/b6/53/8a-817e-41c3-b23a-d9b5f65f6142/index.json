The Public Authority title applies to all ministries, public sector undertakings and also entities that are controlled or funded significantly by the government. NGOs substantially funded by the government also fall under RTI ambit.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe application is to be answered to within 30 days. These are addressed by public information officers at the state and central levels. They are designated by the concerned public authority. Appeals against the body is addressed by the RTI appellate authority.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe 2019 bill alters the original provision for a 5 year office term for posts of chief information commissioner and information commissioner at both centre and state levels. The bill puts the deciding powers at the hands of central government.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is correct:\n<strong>     </strong>The bill gives power to the centre to alter the office terms of the         information commissioners at both levels- centre and state. The bill also seeks to change the earlier provisions of salary equivalence with chief election commissioner and election commissioner at the state and central levels. The conditions of service are to be determined by the centre.\n&nbsp;"
