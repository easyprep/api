  "question": "In light of BHEL commissioning the first lignite based thermal power unit, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Lignite is the highest grade of coal.</li>\r\n<li>Lignite has high carbon content.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nLignite, which is also known as brown coal, is the lowest grade of coal. It is a type of sedimentary rock. It has lower heat content than the other grades of coal. Bituminous coal is of higher quality. Anthracite is the best grade of coal.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nLignite has a very high content of carbon. 60% to 70% of the coal is carbon and it also has a higher concentration of moisture. BHEL has set up a lignite based thermal unit in Neyveli, Tamil Nadu with 500MW capacity."
