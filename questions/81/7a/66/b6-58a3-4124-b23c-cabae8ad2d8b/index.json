  "question": "Which of the following transports water from the roots of the plant to its leaves?",
  "option1": "Xylem",
  "option2": "Phloem",
  "option3": "Cortex",
  "option4": "Both Xylem and phloem",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Xylem",
  "explanation": "Water is passively transported into the roots and then into the xylem. The forces of cohesion and adhesion cause the water molecules to form a column in the xylem. Water moves from the xylem into the mesophyll cells, evaporates from their surfaces and leaves the plant by diffusion through the stomata."
