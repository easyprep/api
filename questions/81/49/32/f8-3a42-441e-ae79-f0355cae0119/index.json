  "question": "Consider the following statements about the UMPPs (Ultra Mega Power Projects) in India: <ol> <li>UMPPs in India are developed using Swiss challenge method</li> <li>UMPPs are either coal based or Hydro-based power plants</li> <li>Tilaiya Ultra Mega Power Project is located in Jharkhand</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 3",
  "option4": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because UMPPs in India are based on plug-and-play mode. The current budget had proposed a &#039;plug-and-play&#039; model for big-ticket infrastructure projects such as power plants, airports and roads. In plug-and-play model, all regulatory clearances are put in place before they are awarded to private developers through a transparent auction. Second statement is incorrect because UMPPs are coal based only. Third is correct."
