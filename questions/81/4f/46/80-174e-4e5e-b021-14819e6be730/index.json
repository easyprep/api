  "question": "Which of the following statements is correct about the term “Hyperloop”, sometimes seen in the news?",
  "option1": "Photo-Voltaic (PV) Integrated Micro Solar Dome (MSD)",
  "option2": "High-speed ground transport system",
  "option3": "India’s first manned space mission",
  "option4": "In-situ rain water harvesting technique",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "High-speed ground transport system",
  "explanation": "Hyperloop is a proposed high-speed ground transport system. It would be used for passengers as well as for freight transportation with the help of vacuum tube and renewable resources. The vessel accelerates to cruising speed gradually using a linear electric motor and glide above their track using passive magnetic levitation or air bearings. Hyperloop train is the brainchild of Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT), a US start-up which is hoping to revolutionise travel. Hyperloop trains travel at a speed of 1200 kmph inside a vacuum tube, which has a low pressure inside it. Also, it uses power from renewable energy sources like solar energy or wind energy."
