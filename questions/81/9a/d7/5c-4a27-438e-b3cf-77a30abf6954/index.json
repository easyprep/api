  "question": "When measuring the characteristics of a small-signal amplifier, say for a radio receiver, one might be concerned with its \"Noise...\"?",
  "option1": "Fundamental",
  "option2": "Fall",
  "option3": "Force",
  "option4": "Figure",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Figure",
  "explanation": "\"Noise figure\" is one critical parameter for determining the \"quality\" of a low-noise, small-signal, amplifier, and perhaps more importantly, the sensitivity of the overall receiver system. It is especially important for VHF (very high frequency) - and higher frequency - designs where most of the undesired \"noise\" (noise that masks or overpowers the desired signals) is generated internal to the electronics itself. In HF (high frequency) applications, atmospheric noise plays a much larger role in determining overall useful sensitivity, so a circuit's \"noise figure\" is less important.",
