  "question": "Given below are two statements, one labelled as Assertion (A) and other labelled as Reason (R). Select the correct answer from the code given below:\r\nAssertion (A): The Cold War and decolonisation process had discouraged more active involvement by United Nations within state.\r\nReason (R): States have national interest as its prime interest.",
  "option1": "Both (A) and (R) are true and (R) is the correct explanation of (A)",
  "option2": "Both (A) and (R) are true, but (R) is not the correct explanation of (A)",
  "option3": "(A) is true, but (R) is false",
  "option4": "(R) is true, but (A) is false",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both (A) and (R) are true and (R) is the correct explanation of (A)",
  "explanation": "The cold war and decolonisation process had discouraged more active involvement by United Nations within state because states have national interest as its prime interest because by the mid-1990s the UN had become involved in maintaining international peace and security by resisting aggression between states, attempting to resolve disputes within states, and focussing on economic, social and political conditions within states. The United Nations does not have a monopoly on peace operations. While the UN often provides legitimation, operations are sometimes conducted by regional organizations, ad hoc coalitions or hybrid arrangements involving UN and non-UN actors, such as the African Union."
