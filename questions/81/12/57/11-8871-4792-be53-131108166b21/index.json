  "question": "Odisha has renewed efforts to conserve its Gharial population. In this light, consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>Gharials are found only in India.</li>\n<li>Gharials are found only in freshwater habitats.</li>\n<li>Odisha is the only state with Gharials, Muggers and Saltwater crocodiles</li>\n<li>The project uses biotelemetry.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "2, 3 and 4",
  "option2": "1 and 2",
  "option3": "3 and 4",
  "option4": "1 only",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2, 3 and 4",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nGharials are found in India and Nepal. Though their earlier range was much larger- including Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar, their current populations are limited to just 14 locations. They are protected under the Wildlife protection act, 1972 and considered ‘critically endangered’ by the IUCN/ International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nGharials are freshwater inhabitants- initially found in major rivers like Indus, Ganga, Brahmaputra and also their tributaries. Their now limited population is facing threat due to loss of riverine habitats. They breed during the monsoon season- hence the choice of time by the Odisha state authorities to release 3 females and 2 males into the Mahanadi.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nOdisha is the only state in India to possess all three crocodile species’ populations. The Mugger crocodile is sympatric with the Gharials- i.e., they are species that were recently separated from each other in the evolutionary process. They frequently encounter each other and share territories.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is correct:\nBiotelemetry is the radio tagging of the animals. This will enable the scientists to monitor the released Gharials. The biotelemetry of the Odisha Gharials is done under the Gharial telemetry project of Madras Crocodile Bank Trust. The Gharial Telemetry project has several objectives like assessing the population health, reasons for mass mortality events, etc."
