  "question": "In context with the recent study claiming the Makgadikgadi Pans as the place of origin of modern humans, consider the following statements about this region:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is a salt flat.</li>\n<li>It is in Eastern Africa.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Makgadikgadi pans are extensive salt flats in Africa. However, about 200,000 years ago, this region was a green wetland. It is an oasis in the middle of a desert. Recent studies, published in Nature journal, claim that it is the place of origin of modern humans.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Makgadikgadi Pans are in the south-western part of Africa. It is found south of the Zambezi River. It is one of the largest salt pans in the world. The study says that climate change caused new favourable zones to emerge which led to dispersal of modern humans from these former wetlands."
