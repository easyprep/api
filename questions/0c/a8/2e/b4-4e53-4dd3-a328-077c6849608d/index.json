  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong> Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe AIS or Automatic Identification System is a tracking system used for tracking ocean vessels to avoid collisions, enable identification, etc. The tracking is done with the help of AIS transponders on these vessels. The system was discussed in light of the recent presence of Chinese research and fishing vessels in Indian Ocean.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe AIS information is handled by the Indian Navy’s Information Management and Analysis Centre in Gurgaon. It is the nodal centre that aggregates the data and disseminates the same to naval and coast guard stations for securing the waters. The AIS information includes vessel name, position, speed, course, destination and also the ports visited. The AIS code is country specific and unique."
