  "question": "Who has been appointed as new Prime Minister of Israel?",
  "option1": "Reuven Rivlin",
  "option2": "Benjamin Netanyahu",
  "option3": "Benny Gantz",
  "option4": "Yisrael Katz",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Benjamin Netanyahu",
  "explanation": "Israeli President Reuven Rivlin has formally nominated Benjamin Netanyahu for a fourth consecutive term as prime minister and officially launched a process that is expected to result in a new government dominated by religious and nationalist parties in the coming weeks. Now, Netanyahu has 28 days to form a government, with a possible extension of a further two weeks. The results from the April 9 election put Netanyahu on course to become Israel\\'s longest-serving prime minister later this year, surpassing the state\\'s founding father David Ben-Gurion. If Netanyahu fails to form a coalition within 42 days, Benny Gantz (leader of the rival centrist Blue and White party) would be given a shot at assembling a government."
