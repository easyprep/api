  "question": "Which of the following statements is/are correct about the term “Quasars”, sometimes seen in the news? <ol> <li>Quasars live only in galaxies with supermassive black holes </li> <li>Quasars emit energy that can be observed at radio, infrared, visible, ultraviolet as well as x-ray wavelengths</li> </ol> Select the correct option from codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is correct</u>. Quasars live only in galaxies with supermassive black holes. These are distant objects that consist of a supermassive black hole surrounded by an orbiting gas. <u>Second statement is correct</u>. Quasars emit energy across the electromagnetic spectrum that can be observed at radio, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, and X-ray wavelengths. Quasars are thought to form in regions of the universe where the large-scale density of matter is much higher than average. Most quasars have been found billions of light-years away."
