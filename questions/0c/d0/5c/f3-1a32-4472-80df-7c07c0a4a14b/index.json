  "question": "In context of the recent synthesis of building material made up of cyanobacteria, consider the following statements about these organisms:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Cyanobacteria are autotrophic organisms.</li>\n<li>Cyanobacteria can produce oxygen.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nCyanobacteria, also called blue green algae, are autotrophic organism-i.e. capable of producing their own food. They perform photosynthesis by making use of carbon dioxide and sunlight. The scientists have recently synthesised building materials using these bacteria for use in space.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe cyanobacteria are known for production of oxygen during their photosynthesis process. They are noted for their role in altering the composition of early earth’s atmosphere during the Great Oxygenation Event and the so called ‘rusting of the earth’."
