Cisse\\'s predecessor Soumeylou Boubeye Maiga and his entire cabinet resigned on April 18 following the massacre of some 160 members of the Fulani herding community on March 23 in the village of Ogossagou near Mali\\'s border with Burkina Faso. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on April 5 to protest against an upsurge of violence that has claimed around 600 lives."
