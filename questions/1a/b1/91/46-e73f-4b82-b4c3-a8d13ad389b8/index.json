  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe program seeks to replace common salt with iodised salt. This is to ensure 100% consumption of the adequate iodised salt (15ppm). This was implemented on recommendation of the Central Council of Health, to iodise the entire supply of edible salt by 1992.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe program seeks to bring the prevalence of iodine deficiency disorders below 5% in the country. In 1992, it replaced the National Goitre Control program. The ministry of health and family welfare is the nodal agency for its implementation. The program also gives financial aid to the states and UTs in some cases like publicity activities."
