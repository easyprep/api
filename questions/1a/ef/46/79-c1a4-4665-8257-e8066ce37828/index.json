  "option3": "Escape velocity",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Escape velocity",
  "explanation": "The minimum velocity with which a body must be projected up, so as to enable it to just overcome the gravitational pull, is known as Escape velocity. V<sub>e</sub> = (2gR)<sup>1/2</sup>"
