  "question": "Which country successfully conducted a test-flight of a hypersonic missile after Russia?",
  "option1": "United States",
  "option2": "France",
  "option3": "South Korea",
  "option4": "Israel",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "United States",
  "explanation": "The United States announced that it has successfully tested a hypersonic missile on March 20, 2020. This is a follow-up exercise of the first joint US Army and Navy flight experiment conducted in 2017.\r\nThe hypersonic missile can travel faster than the current nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles. They travel at low altitudes and switch direction in flight and as they do not follow a predictable arc like traditional missiles, it is harder to track and intercept them."
