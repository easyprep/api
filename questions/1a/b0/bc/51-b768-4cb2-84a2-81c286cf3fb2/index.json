Parliamentary fora have members of parliament only. The main objective behind the constitution of the five Parliamentary Fora is to provide a platform to the members to have interaction with Ministers concerned, experts and key officials from the nodal Ministries with a view to have a focused and meaningful discussion on critical issues with a result-oriented approach for speeding up the implementation process.</li>\r\n<li><strong>While the term of members of Parliamentary committees is usually limited to one or two years; term of members of for a is co-terminus with their membership in the respective Houses</strong> : This is correct statement. Term of Office The term of the office of members of the Forum remains co-terminus with their membership in the respective Houses. A member may also resign from the Forum by writing under his/her hand, addressed to the Chairman, Rajya Sabha, or the Speaker, Lok Sabha, as the case may be.</li>\r\n<li><strong>While Parliamentary committees have secretariat, Parliamentary fora have no secretariat: </strong>This is correct statement. Â Parliamentary committees are provided secretariat by Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. This is not a case with fora.</li>\r\n</ul>"
