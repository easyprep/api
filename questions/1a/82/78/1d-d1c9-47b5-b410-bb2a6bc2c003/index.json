  "option3": 14,
  "option4": 18,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 5,
  "explanation": "Required Mean of this given series = \r\n$latex = \\\\frac{1\\\\times 1+2\\\\times 2+3\\\\times 3+4\\\\times 4+5\\\\times 5+6\\\\times 6+7\\\\times 7}{1+2+3+4+5+6+7}&s=2$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{1+4+9+16+25+36+49}{28}&s=2$\r\n$latex =\\\\frac{140}{28} = 5&s=1$\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer."
