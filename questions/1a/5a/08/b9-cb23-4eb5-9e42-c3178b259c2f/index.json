The Gaofen-5 satellite was launched off the back of a Long March 4C rocket from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center. It was the 274th flight mission by a Long March carrier rocket. It has a designed life of eight years. Gaofen-5 is the first China-developed satellite that can monitor air pollution. It can dynamically reflect the state of air pollution in China through the monitoring of air pollutants, greenhouse gases, and aerosols. The Gaofen project began in 2010.",
