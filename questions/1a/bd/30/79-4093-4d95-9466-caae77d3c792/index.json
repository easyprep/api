  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "This question is based on Economic Survey 2014-15. The survey notes that in recent years there has also been a decline in the labour force and workforce participation rates of women. A large number of analysts have ascribed this to a rapid increase in female participation in education, both in the rural and urban areas.<br> We note here that very low and stagnating female labor force participation rates in urban India over the past 25 years. This stagnation is surprising given that it took place at a time of high GDP and earnings growth, a sizable fertility decline, a rapid expansion of female education, and rising returns to education. A combination of demand and supply<br> side effects have played a role in accounting for this stagnation. On the supply side rising male incomes and education have reduced female labor force participation. Second, as the survey notes, there is a rapid increase in female participation in education, both in the rural and urban areas. This in part is driven by the preferences of educated women for white-collar service employment and stigmas attached with working in other sectors."
