  "question": "Which of the following metros has become the India's first project to receive power from waste-to-energy?",
  "option1": "Delhi Metro",
  "option2": "Chennai metro",
  "option3": "Bengaluru metro",
  "option4": "Kolkata metro",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Delhi Metro",
  "explanation": "The Delhi Metro has become the India’s first-ever project to receive power generated from a waste-to-energy plant.  According to Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), the project is also in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Swachh Bharat Mission”. This will also help in creating awareness on the importance of waste management and utilizing waste in a sustainable manner. The DMRC has started receiving 2 MW power from a 12 MW capacity plant in Ghazipur. The DMRC will take approximately 17.5 million units per annum from this plant. However, the energy off-take will depend upon the actual generation of the plant. The waste-to-energy plant set up by East Delhi Waste Processing Company Limited (EDWPCL) is based on a public private partnership (PPP) involving the Delhi government, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) and EDWPCL. The waste-to-energy plant will mitigate over 8 million tons of greenhouse gases (GHG) over the life of the project."
