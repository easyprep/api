  "answer": 1679,
  "explanation": "In 1679 AD, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb reimposed Jizya on Hindus, at the usual rates of 48 dirhams on the rich, 24 on the middle class, and 12 on the poor. The Jizya was hated by the Hindus as it was a symbol of their inferiority and involved a lot of humiliation. In 1564 AD, the Mughal emperor Akbar abolished Jizya, a poll tax, on Hindus."
