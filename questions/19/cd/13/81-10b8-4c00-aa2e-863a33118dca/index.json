  "option1": "Antarctica Ocean",
  "option2": "Atlantic Ocean",
  "option3": "Arctic Ocean",
  "option4": "Pacific Ocean",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Atlantic Ocean",
  "explanation": "The researchers at the University of St Andrews in Scotland have found that gray seals can copy the sounds of human words and songs including \\\"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star‚Äù. The study showed that 3 trained seals were able to imitate parts of popular tunes. The study gave the researchers a better understanding of the evolution of vocal learning and human language development. It also suggested that gray seals could be a new model to study speech disorders since they use their vocal tracts the same way as humans. The grey seal  is found on both shores of the North Atlantic Ocean. It is a large seal of the family Phocidae which are commonly referred to as \\\"true seals\\\" or \\\"earless seals\\\". It is the only species classified in the genus Halichoerus."
