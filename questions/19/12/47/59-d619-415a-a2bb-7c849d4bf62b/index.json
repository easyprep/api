  "explanation": "The condition of the revolutionary Jatindra Nath Das (Jatin Das), who was arrested on 14 June 1929 under the Supplementary Second Lahore Conspiracy Case and who too had been on a hunger strike along with Bhagat Singh and group, deteriorated and became critical. Jail authorities recommended unconditional release, but the government refused. He was martyred on 13 September 1929 in Lahore jail after a 63-day hunger strike. Durgawati Devi, a revolutionary, and wife of another revolutionary Bhagwati Charan Vohra, led his funeral procession from Lahore to Calcutta by train, with thousands thronging the railway stations on the way to pay homage to Jatin. His funeral procession in Kolkata was about two-mile long."
