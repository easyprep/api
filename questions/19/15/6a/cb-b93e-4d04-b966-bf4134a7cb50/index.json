  "question": "At the time its enactment, the constitution of India provided__: <br> 1. A permanent code of nationality law<br> 2. Fundamental rights and duties of the citizens of India<br> 3. Provisions related to various administrative Tribunals<br> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 2",
  "option4": "None of them",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of them",
  "explanation": "The nature of the provisions made in constitution regarding to the Citizenship was not like a permanent code of nationality law. The framers of constitution made provisions which were specific to that time and then put the onus on Parliament to frame a comprehensive citizenship law. In fact, Parliament of India was given plenary powers on the question of citizenship by the Article 11 of Constitution of India, because it suited to the circumstances of those times. The second and third statements are not correct because Fundamental duties as well as Administrative Tribunals were added to constitution via amendments. They were not part of the original constitution."
