His successors Dudu Mian and Nowa Mian <br />successfully mobilized the Muslim peasants of central and eastern Bengal against the zamindars and money lenders who were <br />mostly Hindus and the indigo planters who were British. Finally, the movement was suppressed by the Bengal government after <br />a series of arrests, trials and persecutions."
