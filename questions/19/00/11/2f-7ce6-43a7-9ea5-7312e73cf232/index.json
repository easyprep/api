  "answer": "Article 1",
  "explanation": "Article 1 of the Indian constitution reads “India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States...”. Recently a petition was filed at the Supreme Court, which sought to remove the name of ‘India’ from the first article.\r\nThe Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde said that Bharat and India are both names given in the Constitution and that India is already called ‘Bharat’ in the Constitution. However, the court said that the writ petition should be treated as a representation and to be sent to the Centre for final decision."
