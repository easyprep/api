  "question": "<p>Which noble gas is used in radiotherapy?</p>",
  "option1": "Neon",
  "option2": "Argon",
  "option3": "Radon",
  "option4": "Xenon",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Radon",
  "explanation": "<p>Radon is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Rn and atomic number 86. A radioactive noble gas that is formed by the disintegration of radium, radon is one of the heaviest gases and is considered to be a health hazard. The most stable isotope is 222Rn which has a half-life of 3.8 days and is used in radiotherapy. Radon gas can accumulate in buildings, and drinking water, and cause lung cancer, causing potentially 20,000 deaths in the European Union each year, with an estimated 20,000 additional deaths per year in the US. Radon is a significant contaminant that impacts indoor air quality worldwide. Essentially chemically inert, but radioactive, radon is the heaviest noble gas and one of the heaviest gases at room temperature. (The heaviest known gas is Uranium hexafluoride, UF6.) At standard temperature and pressure, radon is a colourless gas, but when it is cooled below its freezing point (202K; -71°C; -96°F) it has a brilliant phosphorescence which turns yellow as the temperature is lowered and becomes orange-red at the temperatures air liquefies (below 93K; -180°C). Natural radon concentrations in Earth's atmosphere are so low that radon-rich water in contact with the atmosphere will continually lose radon by volatilization. Hence, groundwater has a higher concentration of 222Rn than surface water. Likewise, the saturated zone of a soil frequently has a higher radon content than the unsaturated zone due to diffusional losses to the atmosphere.</p>"
