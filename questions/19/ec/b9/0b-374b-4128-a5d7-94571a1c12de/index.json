  "question": "Consider the following statements about the Draft Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2016: <ol> <li>The draft provides for the transfer of power from centre to states in matters related to decision on wetlands</li> <li>The new draft rules mention categorising a land as wetland on the basis of biodiversity, reefs and mangroves</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 and 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "<u>Second statement is incorrect</u> because the draft rules mention no ecological criteria to categorise a land as wetland. Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rules of 2010 had criteria for categorising a land as wetland on the basis of biodiversity, reefs, mangroves, and wetland complexes. But the new draft rules contain no ecological criteria for categorising a land as wetlands."
