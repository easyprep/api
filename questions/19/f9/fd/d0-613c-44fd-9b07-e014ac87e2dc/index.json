  "option4": "None of the above is a correct reason",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Birds have extra air sacs",
  "explanation": "Because flying takes a tremendous amount of energy, birds need to get lots of oxygen. The air sacs in their lungs help them to keep fresh air flowing in, unlike mammals, where the &#8220;old&#8221; air within the trachea and mouth (which has low oxygen content and high CO2 levels) in inhaled each time. Birds eliminate this &#8220;anatomical dead space&#8221; problem by using air sacs."
