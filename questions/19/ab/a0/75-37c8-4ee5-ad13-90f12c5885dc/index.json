  "question": "Sound velocity is usually larger in solids than in liquids and gases because:",
  "option1": "solids are more elastic than liquids and gases",
  "option2": "solids are less elastic than liquids and gases",
  "option3": "volumetric expansion coefficients of liquids and gases are higher than solids",
  "option4": "frequency of sound waves decreases in solids due to Doppler shift",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "solids are more elastic than liquids and gases",
  "explanation": "A substance is labelled more elastic if it offers greater resistance to deformation than other bodies, so that it can be stretched less than others."
