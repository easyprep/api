  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe animal kingdom including all avian and aquatic animals are considered as legal person by Indian judiciary. A legal person is an entity that is not a natural person. This designation gives the entity distinct rights, duties and liabilities of a natural person.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe River Yamuna is considered as a juristic person. River Ganga also enjoys the same designation. This is after declaration by the Uttarakhand High Court in 2017 that these rivers are living entities. The rivers have been assigned legal guardians for their protection."
