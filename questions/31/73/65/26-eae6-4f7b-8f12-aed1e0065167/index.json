  "explanation": "• Algeria is the second largest Francophone country in the world in terms of speakers. In 2008, 11.2 million Algerians could read and write in French.<br />• In Libya, Arabic is the official language of the country and several varieties of the language are spoken throughout the country. English, Italian are popular foreign languages spoken in Libya.<br />• Despite the fact that Portuguese is the official language of Brazil and the vast majority of Brazilians speak only Portuguese, there are several other languages spoken in the country.<br />• Mexico has around 120 million inhabitants. Most speak Spanish and others also speak one of Mexico\\'s native languages. Most non-Spanish languages are spoken by Mexico\\'s indigenous peoples, although the country\\'s official language, and by far the most widely employed—and spoken almost ubiquitously—is Spanish."
