The Grand Slam itinerary consists of the Australian Open in mid-January, the French Open (also known as Roland Garros) from around late May to early June, Wimbledon in June–July, and the US Open in August–September. Each tournament is played over a two-week period. The Australian and the United States tournaments are played on hard courts, the French on clay, and Wimbledon on the grass. Wimbledon is the oldest, founded in 1877, followed by the US in 1881, the French in 1891, and the Australian in 1905."
