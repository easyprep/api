  "question": "Which two hot and cold ocean currents meet at the Grand Banks of Newfoundland in the North American continental shelf, making it one of the richest fishing grounds in the world?",
  "option1": "Agulhas Current and Labrador Current",
  "option2": "Gulf Stream and Labrador Current",
  "option3": "Falkland current and Norwegian current",
  "option4": "Labrador Current and Norwegian current",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Gulf Stream and Labrador Current",
  "explanation": "The Grand Banks of Newfoundland are a group of underwater plateaus southeast of Newfoundland on the North American continental shelf. These areas are relatively shallow, ranging from 80 to 330 feet (24â€“101 m) in depth. The cold Labrador Current mixes with the warm waters of the Gulf Stream here. The mixing of these waters and the shape of the ocean bottom lifts nutrients to the surface. These conditions helped to create one of the richest fishing grounds in the world."
