  "question": "The 17th century 'Oonth Kadal' bridge, which is in news recently, is located in which state?",
  "option1": "Punjab",
  "option2": "Uttar Pradesh",
  "option3": "Himachal Pradesh",
  "option4": "Jammu & Kashmir",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Jammu & Kashmir",
  "explanation": "The 17th century \\'Oonth Kadal\\' is a Mughal period arch-shaped bridge, located at the middle of the picturesque Dal lake in Srinagar, Jammu & Kashmir. Recently, it is in news because the Government of Germany has granted Rs 32 lakh  for the conservation of the camel hump-shaped bridge. The restoration of the bridge will bring focus on significance of Dal Lake as part of global cultural and natural heritage. The Oonth Kadal project has come as a shot in the arm for the six Mughal gardens located near the Dal lake, which has made its entry into UNESCOâ€™s Tentative List of World Heritage Sites.  Built in 1670s, Oonth Kadal attracted foreign photographers and Bollywood directors, who shot many songs around it. Of late, it was crumbling due to the apathy shown towards conservation by the local authorities. Oonth Kadal is a stone masonry bridge and was essentially part of the erstwhile Chaudhri Soth (also called Soth-i-Chodri) that started at end of Naidyar Bridge in Kralyar, Rainawari and opened at Ishber Nishat."
