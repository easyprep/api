  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe OIE is an international organisation concerned with tackling epizootic diseases. An epizootic event is similar to an epidemic. The difference is that it involves only non-human animal population. It deals with transparency, safety and promotion of sanitary and safe veterinary practices.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:    </strong>\nOIE is an independent organisation from the United Nations. Its activity is governed by its own constitutional text and is independent from the UN both in terms of finances and institution. OIE is recognised by the World Trade Organisation as the standards when it comes to trade in animals and its products."
