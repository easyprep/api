  "option2": "1, 2 and 3",
  "option3": "1, 2 and 4",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 and 4",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe states have used a very small portion of the allocated funds- only about 168 crore INR spent out of the 1,813 crore INR allocated. This is a mere 20% utilisation. The fund was set up after the 2012 incident in the National capital. It provides for various schemes to ensure the safety of women and also compensation in cases of crimes against women.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nAs per the government data, Chandigarh utilises the most- almost 60% of the allocation. Other top utilizers are Mizoram, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh and Nagaland. However, none of the states or UTs have spent anything on certain programs like Cyber Crime Prevention against Women and Children- leaving it an untapped potential.\n<strong>Statement 3</strong> is incorrect:\nThough Delhi is the site of the incident that lead to the fundâ€™s creation, it is among the poorest users of the fund. It was allocated funds of 35 crore INR for 4 programs, out of which 3 were unused. It used only 3% of the total funds allocated, and that too for the compensation program.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is correct:\nThe fund is monitored by the economic affairs department of the Finance ministry. It provides for an empowered committee that will consider and submit proposals for funding under the framework. The fund is non-lapsable. Since police and public order are state subjects, the onus is on the state governments for implementation."
