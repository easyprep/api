  "question": "Which of the following materials can be used by a farmer to treat the too acidic soil of his fields? <ol> <li>Quick lime (CaO)</li> <li>Slaked lime (Ca(OH)2)</li> <li>Chalk (CaCO3)</li> </ol> Select the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Most often the soil in the fields is too acidic. If the soil is too acidic (having low pH), it is treated with materials like quicklime (calcium oxide) or slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) or chalk (calcium carbonate). Thus, a farmer should treat his soil with lime or slaked lime or chalk in his fields when the soil is too acidic."
