  "question": "With reference to the work of human kidney, consider the following statements: <br />1. After the waste is removed in the kidney, the cleaner blood is sent back through renal artery.<br />2. From Bowmanâ€™s capsule, the filtered liquid passes through tiny tubes where much of the glucose is reabsorbed and sent back to the blood in the renal vein.<br />Which of these statements is/the correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 and 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "A nephron consists of a network of tiny blood vessels, the glomerulus surrounded by Bowman\\'s capsule. Pressure forces much of the blood plasma through the glomerulus and into Bowman\\'s capsule. The resulting tubular fluid, which contains water and dissolved chemicals then passes into convoluted tubule and loop of Henle. This capillary network provides a mean for pick up and delivery of materials that are reabsorbed and secreted by the kidney."
