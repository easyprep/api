  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Swedish monarchy is a hereditary monarchy. It is one of the oldest monarchies in the world. It is about 1,000 years old. The current King of Sweden is King Carl XVI Gustaf. However, it has a parliamentary system along with its own constitution.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Parliament of Sweden is known as Riksdag. The term diet is used to refer to the Parliament of Japan. Riksdag is a unicameral body and is the supreme decision making institution in Sweden. Unlike most parliaments, the Speaker commissions a politician to form the government instead of the head of the state."
