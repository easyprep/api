  "option1": "Homologous",
  "option2": "Analogous",
  "option3": "Speciation",
  "option4": "Genetic variation",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Speciation",
  "explanation": "Speciation is the formation of new species. Speciation is the evolutionary process by which populations evolve to become distinct species. The biologist Orator F. Cook coined the term in 1906 for cladogenesis, the splitting of lineages, as opposed to anagenesis, phyletic evolution within lineages."
