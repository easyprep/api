  "option2": 1948,
  "option3": 1949,
  "option4": 1950,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 1948,
  "explanation": "The \"1948 (or First) Arab–Israeli War\" was the second and final stage of the 1947–49 Palestine war. The Middle East region has probably suffered more rivalry and conflict than any other part of the world. The 1948 Arab-Israeli war was the first instance of a bloody and hostile battle, triggered by the declaration of Israel’s independence on 14 May 1948. The 1948 war was caused by a number of ‘international and intraregional factors’ intertwining to create a complex situation and catalyst for war. The war resulted in Israel’s victory, yet had significant consequences on not only regional politics of this area, but also international relations, which are still visible today. This war resulted in - Israeli victory, Jordanian partial victory, Palestinian Arab defeat, Egyptian defeat, Arab League strategic failure, 1949 Armistice Agreements; Israel keeps the area allotted to it by the Partition Plan and captures ~60% of the area allotted to Arab state; Jordanian rule of West Bank, Egyptian occupation of the Gaza Strip."
