  "answer": "Cultural Osmosis",
  "explanation": "The Nomadic Herders have a strong loyalty to their tribes. However, when the herders become sedentary the social fabric tends to get torn apart. People on the margins of the traditional herding areas are more exposed to the outside contact and influence. Here occurs a process called cultural osmosis whereby some nomads shed their traditional occupation and settle down at the edge of the agricultural areas."
