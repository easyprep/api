  "question": "Excessive use of nitrogenous fertilizers leads to:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Eutrophication</li>\r\n<li>Ground-level ozone</li>\r\n<li>Nitrification</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "3 Only",
  "option3": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Eutrophication is the enrichment of surface waters with plant nutrients. This can be a problem in marine habitats such as lakes as it can cause algal blooms. Ground level Ozone is formed just over the surface of earth. It consists of two primary pollutants viz. nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Nitrification is the biological oxidation of ammonia or ammonium to nitrite followed by the oxidation of the nitrite to nitrate."
