The climate change is the thrust area of the 36-ISEA. The main purpose of this expedition is to install stakes on ice for Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) measurements around Bharati and Maitri to validate glacier surface velocity derived from satellite data to estimate thickness of snow over land and sea ice using Ground Penetrating Radars (GPR\\'s) and also to verify conditions of snow over sea and land ice. The headquarters of the NCAOR is located at Vasco da Gama in Goa."
