  "question": "Which Indian armed force has decided to observe 2019 as ‘Year of Next of Kin’?",
  "option1": "Indian Navy",
  "option2": "Indian Air Force",
  "option3": "Indian Army",
  "option4": "Indian Coast Guard",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Indian Army",
  "explanation": "The Indian Army has decided to commemorate 2019 as the ‘Year of Next of Kin’ and plans to reach out to the next of kin of battle casualties, ex-servicemen and serving soldiers to inform them of entitled financial benefits, welfare schemes and help resolve pension related problems. The issue gains importance in light of most next of kin of deceased soldiers being unaware of the financial benefits that are entitled to them. Incorrect and incomplete documentation is a common problem for most of the next of kin, which aggravates their plight. Indian Army plans to overcome these challenges through its formations and regimental centres.  It will also seek the involvement of the defence ministry, Nepal Embassy (due to several soldiers being recruited from Nepal), Sainik Boards, banks and welfare agencies such as the Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS). The Directorate of Indian Army Veterans will be the nodal agency. Earlier, the Indian Army marked 2018 as the \\'Year of Disabled in the Line of Duty\\'."
