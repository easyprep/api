  "question": "Identify the boxing punch technique. \"One contender draws non-injuring offensive punches to let their opponent fatigue themself. This then gives the contender an advantage as the opponent becomes tired, allowing the contender to execute devastating offensive maneuvers and thereby win\"?",
  "option1": "Rope-a-dope Punch",
  "option2": "Bolo Punch",
  "option3": "Overhand Punch",
  "option4": "Check hook Punch",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Rope-a-dope Punch",
  "explanation": "Used by Muhammad Ali in his 1974 \"the Rumble in the Jungle\" bout against George Foreman, the rope-a-dope method involves lying back against the ropes, covering up defensively as much as possible and allowing the opponent to attempt numerous punches. The back-leaning posture, which does not cause the defending boxer to become as unbalanced as he would during normal backward movement, also maximizes the distance of the defender's head from his opponent, increasing the probability that punches will miss their intended target. Weathering the blows that do land, the defender lures the opponent into expending energy while conserving his/her own. If successful, the attacking opponent will eventually tire, creating defensive flaws which the boxer can exploit."
