It is an international treaty whose objective is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, to promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. <br />India is against the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty because it discriminates with the non-nuclear nations. India\\'s civil nuclear strategy has been directed towards complete independence in the nuclear fuel cycle, necessary because it is excluded from the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty due to it acquiring nuclear weapons capability after 1970.<br />\r\n&nbsp;"
