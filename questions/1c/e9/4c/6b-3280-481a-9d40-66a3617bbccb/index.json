  "question": "A FIR was filed against a group of eminent personalities for writing open letter to PM Modi on lynching. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>This law was first used against Subash Chandra Bose.</li>\n<li>In 1968, the Law Commission called for the repealing of Section 124A.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThis law was first used to prosecute Bal Gangadhar Tilak in 1897. This case led to Section 124A of the IPC that deals with sedition. The sedition laws came to force in 17<sup>th</sup> Century England. These laws were borrowed and inserted into IPC in 1870. Gandhi too was under the scrutiny of this law for his articles in Young India and had famously pleaded guilty.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Law commission, in 1968, had rejected the idea of repealing of Section 124A. In 1971, the Panel had recommended the expansion of the scope of section to include the Constitution, the legislature and the judiciary. In addition, it had also called for government to be established by law as institutions against which “dissatisfaction” cannot be tolerated."
