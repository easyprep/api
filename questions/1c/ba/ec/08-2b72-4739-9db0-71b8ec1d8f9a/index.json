  "explanation": "The Union Cabinet on 20th November, 2019 approved the proposal for enactment of Recycling of Ships bill, 2019. It also nodded to the Hong Kong International Convention for safe and environment sound recycling of ships.<br />India is one of the leaders of ship recycling industry with a share of 30% of the market. According to UNCTAD’s report on “Review of Maritime Transport, 2018”, in 2017 alone India has demolished 6323 tonnes of known ship scrapping all over the world. Though the industry is labor intensive, it is susceptible to concerns on environmental safety.<br />The bill also accedes to the Hong Kong International Convention for safe and environment sound recycling of ships, 2009. The convention aims to ensure that the ships after reaching the end of their operational lives do not pose any threats to human and environment. It was organized by the IMO (International Maritime Organization) in Hong Kong."
