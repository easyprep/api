  "option2": "Only 1, 2 & 4",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "Kindly note that Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) refers to the glacier floods caused by the drainage of naturally dammed lakes in the glacier, on or at the margin of glaciers. GLOFs are common in Himalayan region. Many big glaciers melted rapidly, forming a large number of glacial lakes. Such lakes are inherently unstable and can be subject to catastrophic drainage, which is a potential source of danger to people and property in the valleys below them. These result in serious death tolls and destruction of valuable natural resources, such as forests, farms, and costly mountain infrastructures. This term was making news because of rumours that the Kedarnath tragedy few years back was caused by a GLOF. However, it was confirmed later that this tragedy was not caused due to GLOF but due to a combination of several factors viz. early rainfall, movement of southwest monsoon winds, and the formation of a temporary lake."
