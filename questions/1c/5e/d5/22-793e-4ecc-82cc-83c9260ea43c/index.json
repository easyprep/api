  "question": "The South Asian Climate Outlook Forum reported that the Indian Ocean Dipole is in a positive mode. In this context, consider the following statements about the Indian Ocean Dipole:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>During positive Indian Ocean Dipole/ IOD, the western part of Indian Ocean is cooler than the eastern part.</li>\n<li>During negative IOD, the western part of the Indian Ocean is warmer than the eastern part.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nIOD is a seesaw/ oscillation of ocean water temperatures. The IOD has major bearing on the performance of monsoons in India. A positive IOD implies warmer ocean temperatures in the western Indian Ocean leading to cloud formation and good monsoon performance.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nA negative IOD implies that the western part of Indian Ocean is cooler than the eastern part of the Indian Ocean. This negatively impacts the monsoons in India. This is because, the high temperatures off the Sumatran coasts favour clouding there over the cloud formations off the African coast.\n&nbsp;"
