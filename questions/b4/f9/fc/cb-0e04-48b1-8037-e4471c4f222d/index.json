  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe ABVKY and RGSKY are both provisions of social security for the unemployed. Both the scheme require the unemployed person to be insured under the Employee State Insurance Act. The ESIC is an important component of both the schemes.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe ABVKY scheme is in addition to the RGSKY.
