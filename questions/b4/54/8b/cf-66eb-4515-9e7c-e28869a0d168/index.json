  "question": "In which of the following case, law of demand fails?",
  "option1": "Giffen goods",
  "option2": "Normal goods",
  "option3": "Inferior goods",
  "option4": "Both Giffen and Inferior goods",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Giffen goods",
  "explanation": "A Giffen good, in economic theory, is a good that is in greater demand as its price increases. For example, if the price of an essential food staple, such as rice, rises it may mean that consumers have less money to buy more expensive foods, so they will actually be forced to buy more rice."
