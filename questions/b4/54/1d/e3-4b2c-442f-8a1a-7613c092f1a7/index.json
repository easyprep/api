  "option1": "Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru",
  "option2": "Rajendra Prasad",
  "option3": "Lala Lajpat Rai",
  "option4": "Pandit Motilal Nehru",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru",
  "explanation": "In 1928, for the first time a constitution for India was drafted by Nehru Committee that was headed by Moti Lal Nehru. A year later, in the Lahore session of December 1929, Congress passed the Poorna Swaraj resolution. It was the same session in which Jawaharlal Nehru was elected as president of the Congress.\r\nHere, please note that though the congress passed the Poorna Swaraj Resolution in December 1929, it was a month later on January 26, 1930, when a Pledge of Indian Independence also known as Declaration of Independence was taken.  You must note here that while the Poorna Swaraj Resolution was drafted by Jawaharlal Lal Nehru, the “Declaration of Independence” pledge was drafted by Mahatma Gandhi in 1930 and it echoed the essence of American Declaration of Independence. After this pledge January 26, 1930 was declared as Independence Day by Indian National Congress."
