He will hold the position for a period of 5 years. Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan administered the oath to him at Tummalapalli Kshetrayya Kalakshetram. The YSR Congress government amended the Lokayukta Act in the recent budget session &amp; enabled appointment of a retired judge as Lokayukta, which pave the way for constituting the corruption-probing body.<br />\r\n<div> </div>"
