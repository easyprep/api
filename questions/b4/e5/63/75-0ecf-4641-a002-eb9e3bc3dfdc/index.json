  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about atmospheric pressure?<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The air at the surface is denser and hence has lower pressure</li>\n<li>The air pressure is proportional to density as well as temperature</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "Due to the influence of gravity, the air at the surface is denser and hence has higher pressure. A change in either temperature or density will cause a corresponding change in the air pressure. The air pressure is proportional to density as well as temperature."
