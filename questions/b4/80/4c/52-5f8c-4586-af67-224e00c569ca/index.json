  "explanation": "The language of this question may be ambiguous. If we talk about the Archaeological evidence of deity worship, then we find traces of Puja rituals and worship of idols in temples from Gupta Empire era (i.e. 4th century AD). The Gupta Period was marked by great transformation in Hinduism and Buddhism. This period is known for wide prevalence of worship of \\'Shakti\\' and specification of images of different gods and goddesses that were incorporated from Puranas. The cult of Kartikeya and Ganesha was also very prominent during that period."
