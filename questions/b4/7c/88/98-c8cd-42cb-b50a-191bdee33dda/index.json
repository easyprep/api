  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe cabinet recently cleared the formation of the trust, called Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra. It is to be a 15 member body with one of the members from the Dalit community. The trust is to be formed under the 1993 Acquisition of Certain Area at Ayodhya Act.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe trust is being set up according to the November 2019 Supreme Court judgement on the Babri Masjid case. The court had recognised the deity, Sri Ram Lalla Virajman, as a legal entity but not the Janmasthan. The title of the land was awarded to the deity and is to be held by the trust."
