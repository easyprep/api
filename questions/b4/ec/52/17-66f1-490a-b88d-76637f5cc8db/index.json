  "explanation": "The five states of India - Kerala, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, and Chhattisgarh - have recently celebrated their foundation day on November 1. In Kerala, the day marked the 62nd anniversary of the establishment of the state. Organised on linguistic principles, the modern borders of Kerala came into existence in 1956 when Travancore-Cochin state was merged with Malabar district of Madras and Kasaragod taluk of South Canara district. On this day, Karnataka celebrated its Foundation Day (Karnataka Rajyotsav) with pomp and gaiety. The state of Madhya Pradesh was formed on 1 November 1956 by merging the princely state of Bhopal with the neighbouring states.  Chhattisgarh was formed on November 1, 2000, by partitioning 16 Chhattisgarh speaking southeastern districts of Madhya Pradesh. Haryana, which was formed on a linguistic basis on 1 November 1966, also celebrated its Foundation Day."
