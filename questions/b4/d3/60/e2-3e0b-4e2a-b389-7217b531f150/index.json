  "question": "Which type of semiconductor do we get when pure silicon is doped with a group-5 element?",
  "option1": "n-type semiconductor",
  "option2": "p-type semiconductor",
  "option3": "Intrinsic semiconductor",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "n-type semiconductor",
  "explanation": "The semiconductor doped with pentavalent impurity, electrons become the majority carriers and holes the minority carriers. These semiconductors are, therefore, known as n-type semiconductors."
