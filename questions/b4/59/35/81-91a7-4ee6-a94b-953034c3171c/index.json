  "question": "Recently, Indian scientists have developed a supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton test loop facility that would help generate clean energy from future power plants including solar thermal. This technology has been developed indigenously by the scientists of _?",
  "option1": "Bhabha Atomic Research Centre",
  "option2": "Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore",
  "option3": "Indian National Science Academy",
  "option4": "Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore",
  "explanation": "Indian scientists from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore have developed a super critical carbon dioxide Brayton test loop facility that would help generate clean energy from future power plants including solar thermal. Supercritical carbon dioxide-based power generation is said to offer an efficient alternative to conventional steam-based power plants. The technology will help the country in reducing the carbon footprint of power generation significantly."
