  "question": "The average of six consecutive even numbers is 29. Find the largest of these numbers.",
  "option1": 32,
  "option2": 35,
  "option3": 34,
  "option4": 33,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 34,
  "explanation": "Let the numbers be x, x+2, x+4, x+6, x+8, x+10. Accoring to the question :\r\n$latex \\\\frac{x+\\\\left ( x+2 \\\\right )+\\\\left ( x+4 \\\\right )+\\\\left ( x+6 \\\\right )+\\\\left ( x+8 \\\\right )+\\\\left ( x+10 \\\\right )}{6}=29&s=1$\r\n$latex => 6x + 30 = 174$\r\n$latex => 6x = 174 - 30 = 144$\r\n$latex => x=\\\\frac{144}{6}=24&s=1$\r\nNow because the largest number is x+10 = 24+10 = 34\r\nHence option [C] is the right answer."
