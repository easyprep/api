Born in 1920, she hailed from a community that was at the time referred to as ‘untouchable’. She is best known for extending free of cost midwife services to women at a time when medical help was hard to come by in rural areas. It is believed that she learned the art from her grandmother, Marigemma, at a very young age. She had helped deliver more than 15,000 babies in Krishnapura, a remote village in Pavagada taluk in Karnataka.  Her work received special recognition in Krishnapura &  was conferred an honorary doctorate by the Tumkur University in 2014.  She was also conferred with the Padma Shri by President Ram Nath Kovind on March 20, 2018."
