There exists direct connection of fundraisers with funders, generally over internet platforms, where lenders range from individual investors to non-bank lending companies. Peer-to Peer lending provides an online platform which enables debt financing or equity financing between lenders and borrowers without the use of an official financial institution such as banks or an intermediary.

Crowd funding is the pooling of small amounts of money from many investors through internet platforms. Shadow banking system involves financial intermediaries in facilitating the creation of credit across the global financial system but whose members are not subject to regulatory oversight as it is unregulated activities by regulated institutions."
