  "explanation": "Gumbe is a specific genre, mostly influenced by the fast tempo zouk style called \"zouk beton\" (music of the French Caribbean popularized by Kassav in the 1980s); though the same term also refers to any music of the country. True gumbe is a fusion of several Bissau Guinean folk traditions. Gumbe is the genre most closely associated with Bissau Guinean music worldwide. Gumbe is primarily vocal and percussive music that has been associated with nationalist thought since colonial times.",
