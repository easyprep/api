  "question": "A man swims downstream a distance of 15 km in 1 hour. If the speed of the current is 5 km/hr, the time taken by the man to swim the same distance upstream is :",
  "option1": "1 hour 30 minutes",
  "option2": "45 minutes",
  "option3": "2 hour 30 minutes",
  "option4": "3 hours",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "3 hours",
  "explanation": "Let the speed of man in still water be x km/hr. \r\n$latex \\\\therefore \\\\frac{15}{x+5} = 1&s=1$\r\n$latex => x+5 = 15$\r\n$latex => x = 10km/hr$\r\nâˆ´ Time taken in swimming upstream = \r\n$latex = \\\\frac{15}{10-5} = 3 hours&s=1$\r\nHence option [D] is correct answer."
