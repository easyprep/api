  "option1": "Georgia",
  "option2": "Bulgaria",
  "option3": "Romania",
  "option4": "Armenia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Georgia",
  "explanation": "Georgia's traditional folk sport is \"Lelo Burti\".Lelo or Lelo burti, literally a \"field ball playing\", is a Georgian folk sport, which is a full-contact ball game, and very similar to rugby. Within Georgian rugby union terminology, the word Lelo is used to mean a try, and the popularity of rugby union in Georgia has also been attributed to it. In 2014, Lelo burti, along with khridoli, a traditional martial art, was inscribed by the government of Georgia as a \"nonmaterial monument\" of culture. It appears in the 12th-century Georgian epic poem The Knight in the Panther's Skin in which the characters play lelo burti."
