The novelist was praised by the Swedish Academy as a writer \\\"who, in novels of great emotional force, has uncovered the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world\\\".The prize of 9 million Swedish kronor will be awarded to him. The literature prize is given for a lifetime of writing rather than for a single work. Ishiguro has written eight books, which have been translated into over 40 languages. His most famous novels \\\"The Remains of the Day\\\" and \\\"Never Let Me Go\\\" were adapted into highly acclaimed films. He won the Booker Prize in 1989 for The Remains of the Day and made an Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1995."
