  "answer": "Hussain Zaidi",
  "explanation": "The novel \\\"Eleventh Hour\\\" is authored by Crime writer Hussain Zaidi to pay tribute to the men in uniform. The book is inspired by and derived from real-life events - a vast stash of RDX that has remained undiscovered since the Mumbai serial blasts of 1993 and the agencies totally clueless about it; the jailbreak in Bhopal of five men; the hijacking of an Indian ship and a commercial vessel by Somali pirates and Pakistan\\'s designs to spread terror in India. The novel is published by HarperCollins India. Zaidi, who has done investigative, crime and terror reporting in various newspapers, is the author of several books including \\\"Black Friday\\\", \\\"Dongri to Dubai\\\", \\\"Mafia Queens of Mumbai\\\" and \\\"Byculla to Bangkok\\\". Several of his books have been adapted into movies including the eponymous \\\"Black Friday\\\", directed by Anurag Kashyap; \\\"Shootout at Wadala\\\", based on \\\"Dongri to Dubai\\\", directed by Sanjay Gupta; and \\\"Phantom\\\", based on \\\"Mumbai Avengers\\\", directed by Kabir Khan."
