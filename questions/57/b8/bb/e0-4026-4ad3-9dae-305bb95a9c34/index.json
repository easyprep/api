  "question": "Consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Epeirogenic movement of earth is responsible for building of continents and ocean basins</li>\r\n<li>Orogenic movement of earth is responsible for mountains buildings</li>\r\n<li>Epeirogenic movement is faster than orogenic movement</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "3 Only",
  "option2": "2 and 3 Only",
  "option3": "1 and 2 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 and 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 2 Only",
  "explanation": "<strong>Epeirogenic movement of earth is responsible for building of continents and ocean basins</strong><br /><strong>Orogenic movement of earth is responsible for mountains buildings<br /></strong>Both of these are correct statements. <br /><strong>Epeirogenic movement is faster than orogenic movement</strong><br />This statement is incorrect because orogenic movement is faster than Epeirogenic movement. Both internal and external forces on earth are responsible for oceanic and terrestrial landforms. Epeirogenic movement of earth exert vertical and radical pressure on earth which is responsible for building of continents and ocean basins. Orogenic movement of earth exert horizontal and tangential pressure on earth and is responsible for mountains buildings on earth.Volcanic forces are responsible for material eruption and volcanic landforms. These movements thus produce structural changes on the earth surface and make it uneven thus producing landforms."
