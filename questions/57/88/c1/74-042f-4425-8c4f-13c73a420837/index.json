  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 Only",
  "explanation": "First statement is incorrect because the National Board for Wildlife is chaired by India&rsquo;s Prime Minister and its vice chairman is Minister of Environment. Second statement is correct.&nbsp;National Board for Wild Life is a &ldquo;Statutory Organization&rdquo; constituted under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Theoretically, the board is &ldquo;advisory&rdquo; in nature and advises the Central Government on framing policies and measures for conservation of wildlife in the country. However, it is a very important body because it serves as apex body to review all wildlife-related matters and approve projects in and around national parks and sanctuaries."
