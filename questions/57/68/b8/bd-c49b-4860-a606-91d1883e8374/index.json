  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct. Children whose diets are chronically low or lacking in vitamin A are at high risk for xerophthalmia, the most common cause of preventable childhood blindness. Golden Rice acts as a tool in fighting Vitamin A deficiency. So, second statement is incorrect because Golden Rice produces beta-carotene which acts as a supplement for vitamin A."
