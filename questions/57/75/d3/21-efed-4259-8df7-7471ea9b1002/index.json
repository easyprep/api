  "explanation": "Researchers at IIT Kharagpur have developed a new technology which will change the way biofuel is manufactured by making the process cheaper, quicker and pollution-free. The 'soil-to-soil' manufacturing technology developed at the P.K. Sinha Centre for bio-energy at IIT-Kgp. 2gm bioethanol can be produced from various naturally available lignocellulosic components. The green leafy part of corn and sugarcane plants, the waste part of paddy straw,bamboo, banana plant, pineapple and cotton plants, kans grass (kassh phool), castor plant and even non-edible weeds that grow in dry and waste land and a mix of all has been used by IIT-KGP to produce bio fuel.
