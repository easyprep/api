The government has also enhanced the extent of guarantee coverage for proposals above Rs 50 lakh from 50% to 75%. <u>Second statement is correct</u> because the corpus of the fund is being contributed by the GoI and SIDBI in the ratio of 4:1 respectively. <u>Third statement is also correct</u> because the scheme guarantees a maximum loan of Rs 2 crore to a micro or small enterprise."
