  "question": "Which of the following artificial sweeteners is not broken down by the body and therefore it is non-caloric (no-calorie sweetener) :",
  "option1": "Aspartame",
  "option2": "Saccharin",
  "option3": "Sucralose",
  "option4": "Cyclamate",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Sucralose",
  "explanation": "Sucralose is an artificial sweetener. The majority of ingested sucralose is not broken down by the body and therefore it is non-caloric. Sucralose is approximately 600 times as sweet as sucrose (table sugar), twice as sweet as saccharin, and 3 times as sweet as aspartame. It is stable under heat and over a broad range of pH conditions. Therefore, it can be used in baking or in products that require a longer shelf life. The commercial success of sucralose-based products stems from its favorable comparison to other low-calorie sweeteners in terms of taste, stability, and safety.It is used because it is a no-calorie sweetener, and does not promote dental cavities, is safe for consumption by diabetics, and does not affect insulin levels."
