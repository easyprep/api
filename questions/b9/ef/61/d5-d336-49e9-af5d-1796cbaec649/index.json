  "question": "With reference to the woollen Industry of India, consider the following statements:<br> 1. While Rajasthan is the largest wool producing state of India, maximum woollen units are in Punjab<br> 2. Most of the wool produced in India is exported in the form of value added woollen products<br> Which among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "The main wool producing states of India are Rajasthan, Punjab, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Karnataka, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Haryana. Punjab alone accounts for 40% of the woollen units, while Haryana accounts for 27%, Rajasthan 10% and the rest of the states account for the remaining 32%. Of the total domestic production of wool, around 85% is carpet grade, 10% is coarse grade and the balance 5% is apparel grade. Bulk of the wool produced in India is of coarse quality and used mainly in the manufacture of hand-knitted carpets. The rest are being used for the manufacture of apparel, blankets, finished textiles, garments, knitwear, etc. 5.2.9. Demand for wool outstrips domestic production, since India produces a lot of value added products that are exported. <em><u>India imports substantial amount of raw wool for this purpose</u></em>. Consumption, which includes domestic production and imports, recorded a CAGR of 3% during the period between 1991- 92 and 2008-09. Decline of 17.3% in consumption during 2008-09, reflects the steep decline in imports during the year, while domestic production grew by 7.5%."
