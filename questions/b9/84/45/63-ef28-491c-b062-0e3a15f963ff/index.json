  "question": "Which among the following conditions are favourable for the formation of Cyclone?<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Large sea surface with temperature higher than 27° C</li>\r\n<li>Presence of the Coriolis force </li>\r\n<li>Small variations in the vertical wind speed</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Cyclone is any low-pressure area with winds spiralling inwards.<br />Conditions Favourable for Tropical Cyclone Formation include:<br />Large sea surface with temperature higher than 27° C,<br />Presence of the Coriolis force enough to create a cyclonic vortex,<br />Small variations in the vertical wind speed,<br />A pre-existing weak low-pressure area or low-level-cyclonic circulation,<br />Upper divergence above the sea level system,"
