  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Voyager 2",
  "explanation": "Voyager 2 has entered the interstellar medium (ISM).It is the region of space outside the bubble-shaped boundary produced by wind streaming outward from the Sun. A noted increase in plasma density indicated that the spacecraft has travelled form hot and lower-density plasma characteristic of the solar wind to the cool and higher-density plasma of interstellar space. This makes Voyager 2 the second human-made object to journey out of the Sun’s influence. The first one was the Voyager 1’s 2012."
