  "question": "&nbsp;Consider the following statements about the proclamation of &ldquo;President&rsquo;s rule&rdquo; in a state: <ol> <li>It must be approved by the Parliament within a period of two months</li> <li>Under President&rsquo;s rule, the state comes under the direct control of the Central government</li> </ol> &nbsp;Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Both are correct statements<br> If the president is satisfied&nbsp;on receipt of a report from the governor or otherwise&nbsp;that a situation has arisen in which the Government in a state cannot be carried in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, he / she is empowered to proclaim an emergency.&nbsp;The proclamation would have to be approved by the Houses of the parliament in same manner as in case of a War Emergency. However,&nbsp;even if Parliament has approved the proclamation, it will normally cease to operate 6 months after the Parliamentary approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;The proclamation can be repeated if necessary so as to allow the period of emergency to continue for maximum of one year. Every such resolution approving the emergency has to be passed by each of the houses of Parliament by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting. If the emergency proclamation authorizes Parliament to exercise the powers of the state legislature, it is open to parliament to adopt one or other two alternative courses. &nbsp;It may pass all legislative enactments for the state including financial legislations. But if the parliament does not find it convenient to do this all additional work, it may confer upon the President to delegate this power to any authority. &nbsp;Parliament is also empowered to authorize the president to sanction expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of the state. &nbsp;Any law made by any of the authorities mentioned above shall continue in force until repealed or altered by a competent legislative or other authority."
