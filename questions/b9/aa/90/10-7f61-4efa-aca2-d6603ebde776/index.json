  "answer": "2 Only",
  "explanation": "Only second statement is correct<br> First statement is wrong because it was the sudden withdrawal of the Non Cooperative Movement which divided congress into Pro-Changers and No-changers.Leaders such as; Moti Lal Nehru, N C Kelkar and CR Das linked up with some Khilafat leaders such as Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy and were called pro changers.But, most of the leaders of Congress had now left the business of agitation for a while and started uplifting the poor people by teaching them how to use Charkha, denouncing untouchability, making nonviolence and Gandhian methods popular and were called No-changers."
