Virasaivism means the Saivism of the stalwarts or heroic Saivism. The Virasaivas philosophy is called Saktivisistadvait a term which means the non-duality of God (viz, Parasiva) as qualified by power or Shakti. There is no duality between the soul and the Lord God. Lord God and soul are in an inseparable union through the inalienable power called Shakti. In Virasaivism Parama Siva is the supreme reality . He is of the nature of existence, intelligence and bliss. Shakti is the power which eternally resides in Parama-Siva as his inseparable attribute. It is the ultimate creative principal mula-prakriti or maya which evolves itself into the phenomenal universe"
