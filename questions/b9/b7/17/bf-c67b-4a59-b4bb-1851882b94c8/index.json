  "answer": "Chhattisgarh",
  "explanation": "Generally, diabetes patients are advised to avoid eating rice. But recently, researchers in India have identified a high-yielding variety of white rice with low Glycemic Index (GI) that is not harmful for diabetic patients and hence can be consumed by them. The newly identified variety of white rice has low Glycemic Index (GI), a measurement that indicates a particular type of carbohydrate-containing food’s impact on a person’s blood glucose (also called blood sugar) level. This white rice variety was found on the “Chapati Gurmatiya” race of rice, which is a traditional cultivated variety of paddy in Chhattisgarh."
