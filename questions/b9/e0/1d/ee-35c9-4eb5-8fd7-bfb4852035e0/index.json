  "option1": "Basmati Rice",
  "option2": "Marine Exports",
  "option3": "Buffalo Meat",
  "option4": "Spices",

  "answer": "Marine Exports",
  "explanation": "Since economic reforms began in 1991, India has remained a net exporter of agri-products, with agri-exports touching Rs. 2.52 lakh crores and imports at Rs. 1.47 lakh crores in FY 2019-20. An analysis of last six years of the share of top ten agricultural commodities in total value of agricultural export shows that there have been significant changes in the composition of agri-exports. The share of marine products in total agricultural export value has remained the largest over the period. Its share in total agricultural export value increased from 14.5 per cent in 2015-16 to close to 19 per cent in 2019-20. The share of basmati rice in total agricultural export value has also shown an increasing trend during the period. Other commodities that have witnessed an increasing trend during the period are non-basmati rice, spices and sugar. The shares of the commodities such as buffalo meat and raw cotton in total agricultural export value have, however, declined during the period. The shares of the commodities such as castor oil and tea have remained more or less stable over this period. [Source: Economic Survey 2020-21]",
