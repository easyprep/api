  "question": "As per Ohm's law, if the resistance of a conductor is doubled, what will be the effect on the current flowing through it?",
  "option1": "it gets doubled",
  "option2": "it gets halved",
  "option3": "it increases 4 times",
  "option4": "No change",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "it gets halved",
  "explanation": "As per Ohm's law, if the resistance of a conductor is doubled, the electric current flowing through it gets halved. As per Ohm's Law: R = V/I where R= Resistance, V= Potential Difference, I = Current"
