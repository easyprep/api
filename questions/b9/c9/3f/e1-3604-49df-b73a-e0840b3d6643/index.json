  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Caribbean",
  "explanation": "Zouk is a popular musical movement that originated in the Caribbean region, most particularly in the islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, the overseas territories of France. In the 1980's this musical movement was popularized by the French Antillean band \"Kassav\". But it faded away too fast due to the strong presence of Compas, another music and dance form. Over time, zouk has become indistinguishable with compas."
