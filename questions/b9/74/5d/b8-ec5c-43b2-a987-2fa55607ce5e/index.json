  "question": "Nuclear Reactors are based on which of the following phenomenon?",
  "option1": "Magnetic confinement of Plasma",
  "option2": "Nuclear Fusion",
  "option3": "Controlled Nuclear Fission",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Controlled Nuclear Fission",
  "explanation": "Nuclear Reactors uses Controlled Nuclear Fission to generate electricity. A nuclear reactor splits the atoms of nuclear fuel (eg. uranium) to generate energy to turn water into steam to drive turbine generators. Nuclear fission is the splitting of a heavy nucleus into two lighter ones. Fission was discovered in 1938 by the German scientists Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and Fritz Strassmann."
