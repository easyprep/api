  "question": "With reference to the recent discussions about blue energy, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Blue energy is the energy generated from various water sources.</li>\r\n<li>Blue energy cannot be decentralised.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe term blue energy is used to refer to energy generated from water in different forms. The electricity generated in this manner is called hydroelectricity. One traditional source of blue energy is river. More unconventional blue energy sources are tidal power and electricity from lakes.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:   </strong>\r\nBlue energy can be decentralised as seen from the recent development of devices by scientists to generate electricity from household water taps. In a decentralised energy infrastructure, large number of small energy generation devices are used to serve the individual household needs as opposed to a centralised power plant."
