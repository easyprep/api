  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Russian Far East has one of the sparsest populations in the world. This is attributed to the inhospitable climate, especially in the northern region. The Russian government has taken steps to improve the region’s demographics in form of tax free zones, free ports, etc.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:        </strong>\nThe Russian Far East is a mineral rich zone. It is estimated that ½ of the Russian hard rock gold is from Siberia and Russian Far East. It also contains rare earth deposits, natural gas, oil, etc. The floating nuclear reactor, recently launched by Russia, is in line with its development strategy for Far East mines."
