  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe report on the Child Well-Being Index was published by NGO World Vision India and research institute IFMR LEAD. The index takes a comprehensive view of child well-being in the states through use of 24 indicators. Among the states, Kerala was ranked at the top. Other top rankers are TN, Himachal Pradesh and Puducherry.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe least performance in the child well-being aspect was from Madhya Pradesh. It has the highest crime rate against children. It also scored poorly in the survival and nutrition aspects. Other poor performers are Jharkhand and Meghalaya.
