  "question": "In light of Google using quantum computer to achieve the quantum supremacy milestone, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Unlike bits, the status of one qubit affects another.</li>\n<li>Quantum computer circuits are made of semiconducting metals.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only  2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nBit is the logical unit used in conventional computers. It is a binary format and can be either 1 or 0. The state of one bit does not affect the other. In case of quantum computers, qubits or quantum bits are used. They can be simultaneously 1 and 0. The state of one qubit affects the state of another qubit.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nQuantum computers make use of superconducting metal in its circuits. Superconductors conduct electricity with zero resistance. This phenomenon is usually seen at very low temperatures and the property disappears above a certain temperature known as the critical temperature. Semiconductors are more common in conventional computers."
