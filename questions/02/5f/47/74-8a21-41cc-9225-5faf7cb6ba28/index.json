  "question": "The scientists of which US University have created a global map of where groundwater meets oceans?",
  "option1": "Stanford University",
  "option2": "Ohio State University",
  "option3": "Yale University",
  "option4": "Duke University",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Ohio State University",
  "explanation": "The researchers from Ohio State University in United States have created high-resolution maps of points around the globe where groundwater meets the oceans â€” the first such analysis of its kind that may help protect both drinking water and the seas.  The study showed that nearly one-half of fresh submarine groundwater discharge flows into the ocean near the tropics. They also found that regions near active fault lines send greater volumes of groundwater into the ocean than regions that are tectonically stable. The findings may help coastal communities better protect and manage their drinking water. The research work is the first near-global and spatially distributed high-resolution map of fresh groundwater flow to the coast. It could give scientists better clues about where to monitor groundwater discharge."
