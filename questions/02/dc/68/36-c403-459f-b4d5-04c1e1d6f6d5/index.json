  "option4": "Glass Industry",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Glass Industry",
  "explanation": "Glass Industry is not a raw material-localized industry because it does not depend on the availability of raw material in the local area in which it is set up. Industries can be classified on the basis of raw materials, size and ownership. Industries may be agro based, mineral based, marine based and forest based depending on the type of raw materials they use. Agro based industries use plant and animal based products as their raw materials."
