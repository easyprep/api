  "question": "If the time of revolution is T in a satellite, then kinetic energy is proportional to which of the following:",
  "option1": "T<sup>-4/3</sup>",
  "option2": "T<sup>2/3</sup>",
  "option3": "T<sup>-2/3</sup>",
  "option4": "T<sup>-1/3</sup>",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "T<sup>-2/3</sup>",
  "explanation": "The square of the period of any planet is proportional to the cube of the semimajor axis of its orbit. So r is inversely proportional to cube root of the square of T. And Kinetic energy is inversely proportional to r. Therefore, K.E is directly proportional to (T)<sup>-2/3</sup>"
