  "question": "Which of the following represents the Snell's law?",
  "option1": "sine of angle of incidence/sine of angle of refraction = constant",
  "option2": "cosine of angle of incidence/cosine of angle of refraction = constant",
  "option3": "tangent of angle of incidence/tangent of angle of refraction = constant",
  "option4": "angle of incidence - angle of refraction = constant",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "sine of angle of incidence/sine of angle of refraction = constant",
  "explanation": "The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is a constant, for the light of a given colour and for the given pair of media. This law is also known as Snellâ€™s law of refraction."
