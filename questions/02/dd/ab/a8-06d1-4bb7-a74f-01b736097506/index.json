  "question": "Which of the following introduce live location sharing for its users?",
  "option1": "Instagram",
  "option2": "Twitter",
  "option3": "Facebook",
  "option4": "Whatsapp",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Whatsapp",
  "explanation": "WhatsApp rolled out the option to share \"live location\" for its users. The \"live location\" sharing feature of WhatsApp enables a user to let a contact or a group trace his/her location or movement on a map in real time for a defined window of time. This is different from the current \"share location\" feature which shares a static location. Like the static location, live location also will be visible only to the contacts or groups the user chooses to share it with.",
