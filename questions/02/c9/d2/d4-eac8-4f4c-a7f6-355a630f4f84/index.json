  "answer": "3 Years",
  "explanation": "The union cabinet recently approved the constitution of the 22nd Law Commission of India. It is to function for 3 years from the date of publication of the order in the Official Gazette. The law commission is not a statutory body. It is not a constitutional body either. It is an advisory body to the union ministry of law and justice. It is an executive body established by the governmentâ€™s order. A law commission has a term of 3 years from the date of publication of the order in the Official Gazette. The current law commission is the 22nd of its kind. It is primarily composed of legal experts as its main function is legal reforms. The first law commission of independent India was chaired by M C Setalvad, who was the then attorney general of India. It was established in 1955. The first ever law commission in India was constituted in 1834 under the chairmanship of Lord Macaulay."
