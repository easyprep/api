  "question": "In November, Indiaâ€™s first nanotechnology products for plant nourishment was launched. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Nano-nitrogen is one of the products.</li>\n<li>These products will help reduce the quantum of fertiliser for the agriculture.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nNano-nitrogen is one of these nanotechnology products launched for field trial in November. It is to be used as an alternative for urea. The trials are to be conducted in Gujarat. The launch was by Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Limited.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe use of nanotechnology will reduce the consumption of fertilisers. Because of higher uptake by the plants, a lower quantum of application will suffice. The nano-nitrogen will reduce the urea usage by 50%. The other products are nano-zinc and nano-copper."
