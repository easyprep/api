  "answer": "Bonn",
  "explanation": "The UN report titled “IPBES Global Assessment” has been released by IPBES  (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services). It is compiled by 145 expert authors from 50 countries. The IPBES  report found that around 1 million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction, many within decades, more than ever before in human history.  The threatened list includes more than 40% of amphibian species, almost 33% of reef-forming corals, and more than a third of all marine mammals. The study is a cornerstone of an emerging body of research that suggests the world may need to embrace a new post-growth form of economics if it is to avert the existential risks posed by the mutually-reinforcing consequences of pollution, habitat destruction and carbon emissions. The report tells us that it is not too late to make a difference, but only if we start now at every level from local to global. The headquarters of IBPES is located in Bonn, Germany."
