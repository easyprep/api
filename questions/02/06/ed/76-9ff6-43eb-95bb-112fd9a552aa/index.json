  "question": "The HCF of two numbers is 96 and their LCM is 1296. If one of the number is 864, then the other number is :",
  "option1": 132,
  "option2": 135,
  "option3": 140,
  "option4": 144,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 144,
  "explanation": "First Numebr $latex \\\\times$ Second Number = HCF $latex \\\\times$ LCM\r\n=> 864 $latex \\\\times$ Second Number = 96 $latex \\\\times$ 1296\r\n$latex => Second\\\\ Number = \\\\frac{96\\\\times 1296}{864} = 144&s=1$\r\nHence option [D] is correct answer."
