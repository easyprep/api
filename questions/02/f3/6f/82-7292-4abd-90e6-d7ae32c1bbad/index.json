  "question": "What is the reason for the increase in the electronegativity across a period from left to right?",
  "option1": "attraction between the valence electrons and the nucleus increases",
  "option2": "attraction between the valence electrons and the nucleus decreases",
  "option3": "increase in the atomic weight",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "attraction between the valence electrons and the nucleus increases",
  "explanation": "The attraction between the outer (or valence) electrons and the nucleus increases as the atomic radius decreases in a period. The electronegativity also increases."
