  "question": "Which international organisation recently estimated that remittances to South Asia will drop 22%, in this year?",
  "option1": "World Economic Forum",
  "option2": "International Monetary Fund",
  "option3": "Asian Development Bank",
  "option4": "World Bank",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "World Bank",
  "explanation": "The World Bank recently announced that it estimates that remittances to South Asia will drop 22% by this year.\r\nIndia is the largest recipient of remittances of the world, which increases the foreign exchange reserves of the country. The reserves are used to fund the current account deficit of the country. After the lock-down and the resulting economic slow-down, the loss of income of expatriate Indians who work in foreign countries will affect the remittances. About 12% of the total inflow is the remittances form people working abroad. The Bank also estimated that Global remittances would drop by 20%."
