  "question": "Consider the following comparisons between the Resourcesat-1 and Resourceset-2:<br /> 1. The Resourceset-2 will be able to collect data from a wider strip of the Earth’s surface<br /> 2. The Resourceset -2 will provide remote sensing data services for entire globe, in contrast with some selected area by Resourcesat-1<br /> 3. The Resourcesat-2 has been launched with additional payload known as AIS (Automatic Identification System) from COMDEV, Canada as an experimental payload for ship surveillance in VHF band<br /> Which among the above statement is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "1 & 3 are correct",
  "option4": "2 & 3 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 & 3 are correct",
  "explanation": "The Resourcesat was launched recently via the PSLV C-16. The first statement which says that Resourceset-2 will be able to collect data from a wider strip of the Earth`s surface is correct. The profile page of Resourcesat-2 on ISRO website mentions that important changes in RESOURCESAT-2 compared to RESOURCESAT-1 are- Enhancement of LISS-4 multispectral swath from 23 km to 70 km and improved radiometric accuracy from 7 bits to 10 bits for LISS-3 and LISS-4 and 10 bits to 12 bits for AWIFS. Besides, suitable changes, including miniaturization in payload electronics, have been made in RESOURCESAT-2. The Swath width means the strip of the Earth`s surface from which data are collected by a satellite.\r\nStatement 2 is NOT correct, because Resourcesat-1 was doing the same job and now Resourcesat-2 extends that.\r\nStatement 3 is correct fact about the latest launch. Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)-C16 has on 20.4.2011 successfully launched India`s RESOURCESAT-2 satellite, the joint Indo-Russian YOUTHSAT satellite, and Singapore`s first satellite X-SAT. Resourcesat-2 is India`s 18th remote sensing satellite. <br />  <br />"
