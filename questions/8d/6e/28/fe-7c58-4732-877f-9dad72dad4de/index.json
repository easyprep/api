  "option1": "Andhra Pradesh",
  "option2": "Himachal Pradesh",
  "option3": "Karnataka",
  "option4": "Madhya Pradesh",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Andhra Pradesh",
  "explanation": "Andhra Pradesh will become the first Indian state to use auto-disable syringes for all clinical purposes to prevent infection. The move will be enforced from the World Hepatitis Day (WHD-2018) when the state government will declare itself as “Safety Injection Use State”. The initiative will ensure one injection will be given from one syringe by mandating universal usage of auto-disable syringes in all clinical/therapeutic cases as part of infection prevention. The move would strengthen the healthcare system by lowering the burden of infections and breaking the cycle of cross infection."
