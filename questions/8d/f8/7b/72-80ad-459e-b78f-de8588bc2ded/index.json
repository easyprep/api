  "question": "Consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Farakka Barrage was constructed to divert the water of the Hughly River to Ganga River in rainy season</li>\r\n<li>The Farakka Barrage dispute had been solved between India and Bangladesh in 1996</li>\r\n<li>The building of Farkka Barrage has contributed in the preservation of the Kolkata Port</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is/ are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 3 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 3 is correct",
  "option4": "Only 2 & 3 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3 is correct",
  "explanation": "The Farakka Barrage Project, constructed in 1975 with the prime objective of preservation of Kolkata Port and for increasing the navigation depth of the Bhagirathi â€“ Hooghly waterway, has a 2225 m long barrage across Ganga with a canal head regulator to divert 40,000 cusec of water through a feeder canal for inland navigation to maintain Kolkata Port. Due to its continuous use, most of the barrage gates, feeder canal and appurtenant works need special repairs and upkeep of the operating system.\r\nThe first statement is incorrect because, it diverts water from the Ganges River into the Hooghly River during the dry season.\r\nThe second statement is also incorrect. There was a pact signed but the issue remains unresolved even as of today."
