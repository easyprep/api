  "question": "The Prime Minister launched the National Artificial Insemination Program in September. Consider the following statements about this program:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>This is the first time artificial insemination is being used for cattle improvement in India.</li>\n<li>It enables the use of heavy/ injured sires.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nArtificial insemination was used for the first time in the world in dogs in 1780. India has been using the technique to improve its cattle over the years. National Program for Bovine Breeding provides AI service at farmers’ doorstep. It also provides for organised breeding of the cattle using the technique.\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nA major advantage of AI is that it allows for collection and storage of semen from old, heavy or injured sires which are otherwise of high genetic quality. This reduces the need for maintenance of breeding bull by every farmer."
