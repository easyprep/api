  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Parliament can abolish a legislative council if it exists or create it if it does not exist in a state when the legislative assembly of the concerned state passes a resolution to that effect by special majority i.e. total membership of the assembly and a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of the assembly present and voting.<br />The creation and abolition of the council would need some changes in the part VI of the constitution but such changes are not deemed as an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of Article 368 and is passed like an ordinary legislation."
