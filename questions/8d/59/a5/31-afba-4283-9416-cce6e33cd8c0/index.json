The Ghadar Mutiny or the Ghadar Conspiracy—aka the Hindu–German Mutiny or the Indian–German Mutiny—was meant to trigger mutiny in the British-Indian Army during 1915-17, both within India and outside India where the Indian troops were stationed, aimed at ending the British Raj. Its name Ghadar derived from the Ghadar Party of United States. Its prominent members included Bhai Parmanand, Sohan Singh Bhakna, Bhagwan Singh Gyanee, Har Dayal, Tarak Nath Das, Bhagat Singh Thind, Kartar Singh Sarabha, Abdul Hafiz Mohamed Barakatullah, Rashbehari Bose, and Gulab Kaur. It was formally dissolved in 1948."
