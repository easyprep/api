  "explanation": "Mechanization of agriculture is an essential input in modern agriculture. It enhances productivity besides reducing human drudgery and cost of cultivation. Mechanization also helps in improving utilization efficiency of other inputs, safety and comfort of the agricultural worker, improvements in the quality and value addition of the produce and also enables the farmers to raise a second crop or multi crop making the Indian agriculture attractive and a way of life by becoming commercial instead of subsistence. The farm power availability and the average foodgrain yield have a direct relationship. States like Punjab and Haryana, where availability of farm power is more, have in general, higher productivity as compared to others."
