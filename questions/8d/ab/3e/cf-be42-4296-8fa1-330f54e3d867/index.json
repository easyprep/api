  "question": "Which among the following criteria increases the resolving power of an electron microscope?",
  "option1": "If wavelength is short and wavelength of electron beam can be made quite small by accelerating the electrons",
  "option2": "If wavelength is short and light given by electrons has very short wavelength",
  "option3": "If magnification is high and electronic lens provides much higher magnification",
  "option4": "If magnification is high and the electron microscope has a battery of lenses to provide high magnification",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "If wavelength is short and wavelength of electron beam can be made quite small by accelerating the electrons",
  "explanation": "As the wavelength of an electron can be up to 100,000 times shorter than that of visible light photons, electron microscopes have a higher resolving power than light microscopes and can reveal the structure of smaller objects."
