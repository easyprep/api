  "answer": "1 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe Quami Waqf Board Taraqqiati Scheme was announced by the union minority affairs minister, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi. The concept was launched by the ministry in 2009 after the recommendations of the joint parliamentary committee on waqf. This was renamed recently and launched for implementation on war footing.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Central Waqf Council is a statutory body formed under the Waqf act, 1954. It monitors the working of Waqfs across the country. It also advises its state level counterparts. It is the nodal agency for implementation of the QWBTS.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe system seeks to employ geo-tagging of the Waqf property. The GIS/ geographical information system will be used to identify the property for proper record and management. WAMSI/ Waqf Management System of India is an online portal for these properties. It was executed by the National Information System."
