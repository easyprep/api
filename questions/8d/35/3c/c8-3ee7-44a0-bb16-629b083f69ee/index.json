  "question": "Consider the following differences between Raman Scattering and Rayleigh scattering: <ol> <li>While Raman scattering is all about &nbsp;elastic scattering&nbsp;of&nbsp;light, Rayleigh scattering of light is all about inelastic scattering of light</li> <li>While Raman scattering leads to change frequency, Rayleigh scattering leads to unchanged frequency</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 Only",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because Raman scattering talks about inelastic scattering of light whereas Rayleigh scattering of light talks about elastic scattering of light."
