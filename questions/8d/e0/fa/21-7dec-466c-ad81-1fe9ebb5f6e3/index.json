  "explanation": "Marylebone Cricket Club maintains and owns the copyright of the \"Laws of Cricket\", a code for the cricket game. Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) is a cricket club founded in 1787 and based since 1814 at Lord's Cricket Ground, which it owns, in London. The club was formerly the governing body of cricket and still holds considerable global influence. In 1788, the MCC took responsibility for the laws of Cricket, issuing a revised version that year. Changes to these Laws are now determined by the International Cricket Council (ICC), but the copyright is still owned by MCC."
