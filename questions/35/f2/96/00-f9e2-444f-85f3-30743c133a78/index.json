The programme aims at promotion of improved biomass cookstoves in all the States/UTs for providing clean cooking energy solutions to people. It would also reduce the drudgery of women and children and hazardous emissions to some extent. <u>Third statement is correct</u>. UCA is a central sector scheme. The Target Beneficiaries under the Unnat Chula Abhiyan are individual households in rural, semi-urban areas who still use solid biomass as fuel with traditional chulas for cooking purposes and community kitchens of Mid-Day-Meal Scheme. Only cookstoves approved by MNRE on the basis of BIS standards are being provided to the people."
