  "question": "In context with the recent discussions about the applicability of RTI act, consider the following statements about its application to CBI:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The Veerappa Moily commission recommended the exclusion of CBI from RTI’s ambit.</li>\n<li>Only the intelligence gathering units of CBI is exempt from RTI’s ambit.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Veerappa Moily committee was an administrative reform commission. It did not recommend the exemption of CBI from the ambit of RBI act. However, it recommended the exemption of the armed forces from the act’s provisions. Earlier the agency was under the ambit of the RTI.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe entire CBI is exempted from the RTI provisions. The full exemption was granted to it in 2011 though the agency itself had only asked for exemption for its intelligence gathering units. In 2005, during the introduction of the law, the CBI was under the RTI ambit."
