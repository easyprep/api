  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correc",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nHidden hunger is a case of undernourishment caused by deficiency of vitamins and minerals. The people of low income groups are often affected by hidden hunger. Women and children are more vulnerable to it. It can lower the health and quality of life of the individual. \n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe hidden hunger is caused by low quality of food, rather than by low quantity. The reason is cheap food may be available in plenty and be filling. However, the poor nutrient content in it, like vitamin A, iron, etc. leads to deficiencies."
