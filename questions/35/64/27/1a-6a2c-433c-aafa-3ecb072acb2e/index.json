  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe initiative is termed as ‘the Indian Perspective through Bamboonomics’. It aims to utilize the livelihood enhancing potential and the environmental benefits of cultivating bamboo. The measure is aimed at using the tribes’ potential as conservationists of nature and environment.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe measure will enable India to earn carbon credits. The bamboo is one of the fastest growing grasses. Due to its fast growth rate, it can sequester more carbon dioxide. Its cultivation will also enable the restoration of degraded land.\r\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\r\nTRIFED launched the ‘4P1000 initiative: Tribal Perspective through Bamboonomics’. TRIFED is Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India. It was formed in 1987. It falls under the ministry of tribal affairs. The body calls the initiative as the best way to combat desertification and land degradation."
