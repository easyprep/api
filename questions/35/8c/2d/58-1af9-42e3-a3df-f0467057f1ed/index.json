  "question": "With reference to the recent discussion about ‘functional extinction’, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>When the population of a species is no longer viable, it becomes functionally extinct.</li>\r\n<li>The Baiji dolphin is a functionally extinct species.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe term functionally extinct is used to refer to populations that are no longer viable i.e, incapable of breeding. Species which disappear from fossil records and historical reports are also referred to as functionally extinct. A species whose population doesn’t play a significant enough role in the ecosystem is also functionally extinct.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe Baiji dolphin is an example of a functionally extinct species. The Baiji, also known as the Yangtze River Dolphin, is one of the 4 obligate river dolphins. Overfishing, hydroelectricity projects, high levels of industrialisation etc. are some of the reasons for its disappearance."
