  "answer": "naval ship to go green by installing a solar power system",
  "explanation": "Indian Navy&rsquo;s survey vessel INS Sarvekshak, based at the Southern Naval Command in Kochi became the first naval ship to go green by installing a solar power system on board. It has innovatively deployed the zero-maintenance solar power system, capable of generating 5.4KW electricity and replacing the ship&rsquo;s traditional 4.4KW emergency diesel alternator. The solar power generating system has been installed by customising and installing &lsquo;razor-thin, flexible&rsquo; solar panels on the canopy of its telescopic (retractable) helicopter deck. It has light weight, extra-thin and flexible unbreakable solar panels imported from US along with no-fume solid electrolyte batteries. These industrial grade panels are found to be performing well in all-light conditions and are shade-tolerant. They also have a maintenance free life for 24 years making it maintenance free. The system is 100% reliable for power source that can be used for communication equipment, general lightings onboard and battery charging round the clock with battery outputs during night. The low cost system will slash a yearly carbon emission of 60,225 kg and save around 22,995 litres of diesel used to run the vessel&rsquo;s emergency diesel alternator."
