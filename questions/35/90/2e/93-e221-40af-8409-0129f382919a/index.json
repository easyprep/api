  "answer": "Zinc oxide",
  "explanation": "The compound zinc oxide (ZnO) is called&nbsp;philosopher&#039;s wool. ZnO is a white powder that is insoluble in water. Zinc oxide is used as an additive in sun screens, sun lotions, in rubber manufacturing and in photocopying products. Alchemists, as part of their rituals, burn zinc in air and collect the residue, which formed into white woolly tufts. They called it Lana philosophica in Latin, meaning philosopher&#039;s wool."
