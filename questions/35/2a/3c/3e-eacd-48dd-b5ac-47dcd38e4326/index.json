  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Chavang Kut is a post-harvest festival. It is celebrated in the north-eastern states. It marks the Anglo-Kuki War centenary year and is observed by several tribes: Kuki, Chin and Mizo communities. It is celebrated as a thanksgiving for good harvest.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nChavang Kut festival is different from Chapchar Kut festival.

Jhumming is a type of agriculture practiced in the north-east and is also called slash and burn cultivation."
