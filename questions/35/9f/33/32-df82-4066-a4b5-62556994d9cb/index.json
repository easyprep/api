  "question": "The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation had called on the Indian government to repeal the action on article 370. In this context, consider the following statements about OIC:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>India is a member of the OIC.</li>\n<li>All OIC members are members of the UN.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nOIC is an international group that refers to itself as the ‘collective voice of the Muslim world’. Its members are countries with high percent of Muslim community. Though India has the largest population of Muslims outside the Muslim majority countries, it’s not a member.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nAll of the members except Palestine are UN members. The OIC has 57 members. OIC has permanent delegation to the UN. OIC supports the Charter of the United Nations which is the foundational treaty of the UN. However, it does not mention the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and has been reported to shield its members from human rights violation accusations."
