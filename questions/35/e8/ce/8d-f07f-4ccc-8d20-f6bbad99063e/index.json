  "option4": "Nuclear Science",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Internet and Communication",
  "explanation": "A team of Australian scientists have recorded the world's fastest internet data speed of 44.2 Terabits per second (Tbps) from a single light source.\r\nThis speed is enough to download 1000 HD movies in a split second. The researchers used their new device with a single piece of equipment known as a micro-comb, that is made up of hundreds of high-quality invisible infrared lasers from a single optical chip. This result can expand the capacity of network connections across the world, especially the developing and under-developed countries."
