  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Himachal Pradesh",
  "explanation": "The Himachal Pradesh government has launched “Horn Not Ok’’ awareness campaign in Shimla and Mandi along with a statewide mobile application ‘shaur nahin’ (no noise). The main aim of the campaign is to spread awareness of unnecessary blowing horn as it creates unnecessary noise pollution. The other towns of the state will also be brought under the purview of no honking zones after the successful execution of this campaign in the two tourist places for 2 months. Though, no-honking rule will not be applicable on emergency vehicles, including ambulances and fire tenders. The “Shor Nahin” application has been developed to report any noise pollution complaint to the authorities. It’s an initiative of the Department of Environment, Science and Technology in association with the NIC of Himachal Pradesh. It allows a user to lodge a complaint with the officials concerned, including deputy commissioner, superintendent of police and sub divisional magistrate, who can upload the action taken report on the app."
