  "answer": "Maurya",
  "explanation": "Mauryan Emperor Bindusara had friendly relations with the Greek King Antiochos-I of Syria. Deimachos was a Syrian Ambassador who came in the court of Bindusara.  Mauryan Emperor Ashoka the Great: In his rock edict 13th mentions the names of 5 Hellenic kings– Antiochus II of Syria, Ptolemy II of Egypt, Antigonus of Messedonia, Magas of Syrina, Alexander of Epirus. He sent missionaries to all of them.  This shows that Mauryan dynasty maintained the diplomatic relations with distant countries like Syria in the West."
