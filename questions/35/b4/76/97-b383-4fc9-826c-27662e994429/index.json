  "question": "When gasoline is blended with Ethanol then â€”\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Octane number is raised</li>\r\n<li>Energy content per volume is increased</li>\r\n<li>The engine is less likely to suffer damage</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is/ are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "1 & 2",
  "option3": "1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 & 3",
  "explanation": "The use of ethanol in gasoline has become a worldwide tendency as an alternative to reduce net CO2 emissions to the atmosphere, increasing gasoline octane rating and reducing dependence on petroleum products. As the ethanol molecule contains oxygen, it allows the engine to more completely combust the fuel, therefore the engine is less likely to suffer damage."
