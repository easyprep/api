  "question": "Which among the following is / are correct statements with respect to the Tropical Storms?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Tropical storms generally form in the high atmospheric pressure areas</li>\r\n<li>The highest atmospheric pressures are generally recorded at their centers</li>\r\n<li>At any given altitude, environment inside the cyclone is warmer than its outer surroundings</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 & 2",
  "option2": "2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 2",
  "option4": "Only 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "All tropical cyclones are formed in areas of low atmospheric pressure in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. The pressures recorded at the centres of tropical cyclones are among the lowest that occur on Earth&#8217;s surface at sea level. Tropical cyclones are driven by the release of large amounts of latent heat of condensation, which occurs when moist air is carried upwards and its water vapor condenses. This heat is distributed vertically around the center of the storm. Thus, at any given altitude, environment inside the cyclone is warmer than its outer surroundings."
