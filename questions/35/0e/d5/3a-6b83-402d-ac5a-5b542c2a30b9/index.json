  "question": "Which among the following is a source region of air masses?",
  "option1": "Equatorial low pressure belt",
  "option2": "Sub - tropical high pressure belt",
  "option3": "Polar low pressure belt",
  "option4": "Sub - tropical low pressure belt",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Sub - tropical high pressure belt",
  "explanation": "The homogenous surfaces, over which air masses form, are called the source regions.<br />The main source regions are the high pressure belts in the sub tropics (giving rise to tropical air masses) and around the poles (the source for polar air masses).<br />The source region should be slightly at high pressure."
