  "question": "Consider the following statements: <ol> <li>Dew point is defined as the atmospheric temperature below which water vapours begin to condense</li> <li>The dew point declines with the rise of the air in atmosphere</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Both are correct statements<br> If the air temp increases, its ability to hold water vapour increases. Air temperature decreases with altitude and so decreases the dew point."
