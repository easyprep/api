  "explanation": "The World Elder Abuse Awareness Day (WEAAD) is observed on the 15th of June every year to voice opposition to the abuse and suffering inflicted on elderly people. According to the United Nations (UN), around 1 in 6 older people experience some form of abuse. It is predicted to rise as populationâ€™s age worldwide. Elder abuse can lead to serious physical injuries and long-term psychological consequences. It is a global social issue which affects the health and human rights of millions of older persons around the world.  It is predicted to increase as many countries are experiencing rapidly ageing populations. The global population of people aged 60 years and older will more than double, from 900 million in 2015 to about 2 billion in 2050."
