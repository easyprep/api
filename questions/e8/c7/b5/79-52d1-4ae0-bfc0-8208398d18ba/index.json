  "question": "Rainfall on the east coast of Tamil Nadu occurs during October to November due to which of the following reasons?",
  "option1": "Winter monsoon",
  "option2": "Retreating south-west monsoon",
  "option3": "North-west monsoon",
  "option4": "Local winds",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Retreating south-west monsoon",
  "explanation": "Tamil nadu lies on the leeward side for the southwest monsoon winds and receives lesser rainfall. Once the monsoon starts retreating after mid- September, North east monsoon sets in during mid-October. Tamil Nadu lies on the windward side for these winds and hence gets more rainfall during the winter season."
