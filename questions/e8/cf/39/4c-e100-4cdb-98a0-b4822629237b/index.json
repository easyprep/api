  "question": "In context with the recent commencement of Open Market Operations by the RBI, consider the following statements about OMO:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The central bank sells government bonds to increase liquidity in the market.</li>\n<li>The central bank buys government bonds to decrease liquidity in the market.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Open Market Operation is a monetary tool used by the central bank to regulate the liquidity in the market. The RBI recently initiated OMO through the Operation Twist. The central bank sells government bonds to reduce the liquidity in the market.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe central bank buys government bonds to increase liquidity in the market. The OMO can involve ‘outright purchases’ or ‘repurchase agreements’. The former is more permanent than the latter. The RBI initiated the OMO to address the hardening of long term bond yields."
