  "question": "If the earth had no satellite of its own i.e., the moon, which of the following phenomena will not occur ?",
  "option1": "Neap tides",
  "option2": "Ocean currents",
  "option3": "Spring tides",
  "option4": "Tides",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Spring tides",
  "explanation": "The moon has a significant impact on tides, due to the gravitational attraction of the moon on the Earth’s water. This effect is magnified when the moon’s gravitational attraction aligns with the gravitational pull of the sun. This produces the highest high tides and lowest low tides, known as spring tides. When the pull of the moon and the sun are perpendicular to each other, the lowest high tides and highest low tides, collectively termed neap tides, are produced. While ocean currents are primarily affected by winds and the Coriolis force, tides can have a large impact on currents near the coasts."
