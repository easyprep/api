  "answer": 43,
  "explanation": "India joined the Australia Group export control regime and has become the 43rd Member of that Group. It is an informal forum which seeks to ensure that exports do not contribute to the development of chemical or biological weapons. The inclusion will raise India's stature in the field of non-proliferation and help in acquiring critical technologies. India managed entry into Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the Wassenaar Arrangement and Australia Group despite not being a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.",
