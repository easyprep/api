  "answer": "Narendra",
  "explanation": "The book \\\"Bastar Dispatches: A Passage Through the Wilds\\\" has been authored by Narendra, which explores lives of Bastar\\'s Abujhmad tribals. It provides a narrative of these people at peace with themselves and nature, their dialect, their festivities & their delightful interactions. The Bastar Dispatches brings out how forests and the wilds, humans and animals, distances, spaces and the skies, the known and unknown together make up societies and intimacies. Abujhmad stands today as one of the few mirrors left the world over wherein modernity can view itself - its calamities and collapses. The book is based on the author\\'s over 30 years of association with Abujhmad under a field research programme and its contiguous areas in the Bastar division of Chhattisgarh."
