  "question": "Which of the following planet has length of its day and the tilt of its axis are almost identical to those of the earth?",
  "option1": "Uranus",
  "option2": "Neptune",
  "option3": "Saturn",
  "option4": "Mars",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Mars",
  "explanation": "Mars is a planet with a very similar daily cycle as the Earth. Its sidereal day is 24 hours, 37 minutes and 22 seconds and its solar day 24 hours, 39 minutes and 35 seconds. A Martian day (referred to as “sol”) is therefore approximately 40 minutes longer than a day on Earth.<br />Its axial tilt is most similar to Earth. Mars\\' tilt is 25 degrees, just a fraction away from the Earth\\'s 23.5 degrees. Mars also has a very elliptical orbit. Because of this, the difference between its closest and most distant point along its orbit vary by 19%."
