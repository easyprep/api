  "question": "Which state cabinet has approved proposal for jail term for those who abandon elderly parents?",
  "option1": "MP",
  "option2": "Bihar",
  "option3": "UP",
  "option4": "Rajasthan",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Bihar",
  "explanation": "Bihar Cabinet-led by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has approved a proposal to punish sons and daughters who abandon their elderly parents with a jail term. The proposal has provisions for punishments that  could go up to imprisonment if children do not look after their parents properly in their old ages. The cases against the children will be registered under the non-bail able section in Bihar after receiving complaints from the elderly parents. The proposal of Bihar government can be a game changer if it formally makes it compulsory for children to look after parents.  However, the practical problems regarding the implementation of such a rule are likely to be immense."
