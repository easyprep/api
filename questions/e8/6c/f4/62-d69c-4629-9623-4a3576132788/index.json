  "explanation": "The International Museum Day (IMD) is observed every year on May 18 to raise awareness on how important museums are in the development of society.  The day provides the opportunity for museum professionals to meet the public and alert them as to the challenges that museums face. The 2017 theme “Museums and contested histories: Saying the unspeakable in museums” focuses on the role of museums that, by working to benefit society, become hubs for promoting peaceful relationships between people. It also highlights how the acceptance of a contested history is the first step in envisioning a shared future under the banner of reconciliation."
