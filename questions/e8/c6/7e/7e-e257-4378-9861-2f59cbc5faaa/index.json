  "question": "Some studies have suggested that impacts of Green House Gases and Aerosols tend to be in opposite direction. Consider the following statements in this context:<br />1. While Green House Gases tend to reduce the precipitation, Aerosols tend to increase the precipitation<br />2. While greenhouse gases tend to persist and thereby accumulate in the atmosphere, aerosols are generally short-lived<br />Which among the above is / are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "An increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere enhances global warming and surface heating that increases surface temperatures evaporation. While greenhouse gases tend to persist and thereby accumulate in the atmosphere, aerosols are generally short-lived."
