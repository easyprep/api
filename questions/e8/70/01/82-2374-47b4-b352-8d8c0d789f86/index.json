It uses the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE), the National Assessment survey (NAS) and demographic data and can be used as a visual tool by policy makers, senior government officials, academia, and researchers to address gaps and monitor programs in the field of education. Beside this, UNICEF India in partnership with HRD Ministry has also organized a \\'Shiksha Mela Education Open Day\\' to demonstrate case stories showcasing holistic and equitable quality education achieved through convergent programming across 17 Indian states."
