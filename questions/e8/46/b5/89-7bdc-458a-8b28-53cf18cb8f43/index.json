  "option5": "",
  "answer": "They live in large family groups",
  "explanation": "Social insects are highly evolved insects that engage in a variety of complex tasks not practiced by the multitude of solitary insects. Honey bees are social insects because they live together in large, well-organized family groups.  A single honeybee cannot grow or survive by itself. The three distinct kinds of honeybees in a colony are queen, worker, and drone."
