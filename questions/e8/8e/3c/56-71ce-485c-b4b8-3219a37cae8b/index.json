  "question": "In an ecotone, the species which become abundant are called:",
  "option1": "Edge species",
  "option2": "Keystone species",
  "option3": "Endemic species",
  "option4": "Foster species",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Edge species",
  "explanation": "An ecotone is a transition area between two biomes but different patches of the landscape, such as forest and grassland. The ecotone contains not only species common to the communities on both sides; it may also include a number of highly adaptable species that tend to colonize such transitional areas. This can produce an edge effect along the boundary line, with the area displaying a greater than usual diversity of species. The phenomenon of increased variety of plants as well as animals at the community junction is called the “edge effect” and is essentially due to a locally broader range of suitable environmental conditions or ecological niches."
