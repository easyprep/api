The Rasa dance evolved with the legends of gopis and Krishna dancing together. The cult of Radha and Krishna, particularly the raslila, is central to the themes of Manipuri dance. In Sattariya dance, one of the major dances is the Krishna Nritya which portrays the activities of young Krishna. Another dance style in Sattariya dance is based on the life of Lord Krishna; Nadubhangi Nritya covers the story of Lord Krishna defeating the poisonous snake “Kaliya”."
