  "answer": "Bharatnatyam",
  "explanation": "• Thillana is one of the presentation styles in Bharatanatyam, where a host of dancers perform together, exploring the extent of strong kinetics. This style requires exemplary skills in terms of rhythm, timing and synchronization in order to radiate the unique performance charm associated with it.<br />• It is usually the culminating piece of a Bharatanatyam performance. Graceful body movements and some elements of Abhinaya (acting) combine in Thillana.<br />• Bharatanatyam, an ancient Indian classical dance form which had its origin in Tamil Nadu has also roots in the Natya Sastra, a treatise on dance by sage Bharata. This dance form is the manifestation of the ancient Indian idea of the celebration of the eternal universe through the celebration of the beauty of the mortal human body."
