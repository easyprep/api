He wrote that ‘out of the revenues raised in India nearly one fourth goes clean out of the country, and is added to the resources of England”, He presented some more papers on the same subject like “The Wants and Means or India’ (1870) and “On the Commerce of India’ (1871) at London, But the book which drew attention of both the Indians and the world, especially the English, was Poverty and Un-British rule in India. He highlighted that it is a myth that British rule brought any benefit to India."
