  "question": "Which among the following pairs of fronts is/are correctly matched?<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Warm Front - frontal surface along which the cold air becomes active and aggressive and invades the warm air territory forcibly lifting the warm and light air.</li>\r\n<li>Occluded Front - formed when two contrasting air masses converge in such a way that they become parallel to each other and there is no ascent of air.</li>\r\n<li>Stationary Front - formed when cold front over­takes warm front and warm air is completely displaced from the ground surface.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of the above",
  "explanation": "Warm front is that sloping frontal surface along which warm and light air becomes active and aggressive and rises slowly over cold and dense air.<br />Occluded front is the front which is formed when cold front over­takes warm front and warm air is completely displaced from the ground surface.<br />Stationary front is formed when two contrasting air masses converge in such a way that they become parallel to each other and there is no ascent of air."
