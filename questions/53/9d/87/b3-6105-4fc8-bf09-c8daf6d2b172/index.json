  "question": "A pan-India study recently linked vitamin D deficiencies to chronic diseases. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Sunshine countries do not have suffer from vitamin D deficiency.</li>\n<li>Vitamin D deficiency causes low bone mass.</li>\n<li>Vitamin D can be synthesized endogenously in the body.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 2 and 3",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nExposure to early morning sunshine is vital for vitamin D synthesis. Though countries like India enjoy sunshine throughout the year, high percentage of vitamin D deficiency cases persist. This is due to lifestyle choices which keep people indoors most of the time. The study found that 70 to 90% Indians are vitamin D deficient.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nVitamin D is required for regulation of phosphorus and calcium content in the body. Hence its deficiency causes low bone mass, poor skeletal development in children, poor bone health in adults, osteoporosis, etc. The study has also linked the condition to cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, etc.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nThe vitamin D can be endogenously produced in the body. Also known as the sunshine vitamin, it is produced in the skin when exposed to sunlight. It also occurs in some food items like fish, eggs, etc. The study reports that its deficiency is the most under-diagnosed and under-treated nutrient deficiency in the world."
