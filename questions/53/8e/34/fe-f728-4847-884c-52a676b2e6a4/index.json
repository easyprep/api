  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 2",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "Hinduism, otherwise a highly theistic religion, hosted atheistic schools; the thoroughly materialistic and anti-religious philosophical Carvaka (Nastika) school that originated in India around the 6th century BCE is probably the most explicitly atheistic school of Indian philosophy. It is not included among the six schools of Hinduism generally regarded as orthodox. Our understanding of Carvaka philosophy is fragmentary, based largely on criticism of the ideas by other schools, and it is no longer a living tradition."
