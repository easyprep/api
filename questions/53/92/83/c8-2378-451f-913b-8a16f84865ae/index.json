  "option1": 45,
  "option2": 60,
  "option3": 90,
  "option4": 105,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 45,
  "explanation": "âˆµ First Number $latex \\\\times$ Second Number = HCF $latex \\\\times$ LCM\r\n=> 75 $latex \\\\times$ Second Number = 15 $latex \\\\times$ 225\r\nSecond Number $latex = \\\\frac{15\\\\times 225}{75} = 45&s=1$\r\nHence option [A] is correct answer."
