  "question": "Consider the following comparisons of CAT-Scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>CAT scan used X-ray, MRI uses no X-ray and thus no ionizing radiation</li>\r\n<li>CAT scan gives best results for soft tissues while MRI gives best results for Bones</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is/ are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "The second statement is not correct. MRI does not do a very good job with bones. Further, MRI is also not advised to the people who have an artificial pacemaker implanted as the magnetic / radio maves may interfere. CT scanning carries with it some risks due to the use of ionizing radiation from the x-rays, MRI uses no ionizing radiation."
