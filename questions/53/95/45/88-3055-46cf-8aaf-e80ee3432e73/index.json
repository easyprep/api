  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "An ecosystem is formed by the interaction of biotic and abiotic factors. Niche is formed in an ecosystem. An ecologoical niche is the role and responsibility of an organism in its environment formed due to its interaction with biotic and abiotic factors of an ecosystem. It includes things like food habit, habitat, functional interaction etc. No two species can have exactly same niche in an ecosystem. They can have overlapping niches to some extant but not the same.<br />A ecotone is formed with the interaction of two different biological community thus forming a transitional area having its own ecosystem. Example- Mangroves."
