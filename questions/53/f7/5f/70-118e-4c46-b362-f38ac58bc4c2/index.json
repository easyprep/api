  "answer": "2 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nCotonou is the seat of Benin government. However, the capital city is Porto-Novo. India’s President visited Cotonou as a part of the 3 countries trip (to Benin, Gambia and Guinea). Benin is located along the Bight of Benin- a section of the northernmost tropical part of Atlantic Ocean. It is highly dependent on agriculture and is a major exporter of cotton.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nIndia is Benin’s largest trading partner. It is worth about 800 million USD. The President has announced a fresh line of credit worth 100 million USD to Benin. India is already lending a different credit line for water supply schemes in Benin. Benin had supported India’s candidature to the UNSC.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nGambia is the smallest among the African mainland countries. It is located next to Senegal and bordered by the Atlantic Ocean. 30% of GDP is from agriculture but it employs 70% of the population. India is Gambia’s third largest trading partner.\n&nbsp;"
