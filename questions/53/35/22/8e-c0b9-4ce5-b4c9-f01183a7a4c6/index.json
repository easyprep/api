  "question": "Which among the following is the correct impact of the London Forces in the Cycloalkanes?",
  "option1": "The melting and boiling points get increased",
  "option2": "The Melting and boiling points get decreased",
  "option3": "There is not impact on the melting and boiling points",
  "option4": "The melting point increases but boiling point decreases",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "The melting and boiling points get increased",
  "explanation": "Please note that the Cycloalkanes with more than 20 carbon atoms are called Cycloparaffins. The cycloalkanes have the same properties as the alkanes but they have `Higher Boiling &amp; Melting points`. This is because of the stronger dispersion forces between the atoms known as London Forces."
