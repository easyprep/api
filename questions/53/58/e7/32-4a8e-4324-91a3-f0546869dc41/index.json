  "question": "Consider the following statements about Bitcoins: <ol><li>Bitcoin is a virtual currency that enables payment in a decentralised peer-to-peer network</li><li>In India, bitcoins are controlled and regulated by the RBI</li><li>Bitcoins are listed on Indian stock exchanges and can be used for commodity trading</li></ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "<u>Second statement is incorrect</u> because bitcoins are not under control of RBI. It floats on a common network. RBI has not legalised bitcoin as a legal tender but has also not declared it unauthorized. HighKart.com became the first e-commerce site in India to exclusively accept bitcoins as a payment method."
