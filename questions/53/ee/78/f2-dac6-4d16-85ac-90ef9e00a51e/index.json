  "explanation": "The World Health Day (WHD) is observed every year on April 7 to mark the anniversary of the founding of the World Health Organization (WHO). The day provides with a unique opportunity to mobilize action around a specific health topic of concern to people all over the world. This year (in 2017), the WHO is leading a one-year global campaign on depression with theme “Depression: Let\\'s Talk”,  which is the leading cause of ill health and disability worldwide. Depression is the leading cause of ill health and death among 15-29-year olds. More than 300 million people are now living with depression, an increase of more than 18 per cent between 2005 and 2015. It affects people of all ages, from all walks of life, in all countries."
