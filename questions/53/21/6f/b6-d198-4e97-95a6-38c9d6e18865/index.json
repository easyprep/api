  "answer": "Swami Dayananda Saraswati",
  "explanation": "Swami Dayanand’s greatest asset was his mastery over the Sanskrit language and the Vedas. In 1875, he founded the Arya Samaj. Its main aim was to propagate the true knowledge of the Vedas and discard all evils that had crept into the Hindu society later in its name. He opposed untouchability. He was similarly opposed to polytheism, avataravada and ritualism. His slogan was ‘go back to the Vedas’ whose authority he accepted. For the first time in the history of India, the Vedas were printed in India under his patronage. Personally, his most important work was Satyartha Prakasha (The Light of Truth).\r\nHis followers started a Dayanand Anglo-Vedic (DAV) School and College in Lahore (now in Pakistan) in 1886."
