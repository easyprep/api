However, US claimed that it does not support the operation, but, at the same time, cannot act against the NATO ally.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Turkish government does not back the Syrian Democratic Forces. It backs the Syrian National Army which is composed of Syrian Arabs and Syrian Turkmens.
