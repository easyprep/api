  "answer": "Smriti Mandhana",
  "explanation": "On 6th February 2019, Opener Smriti Mandhana hammered  the fastest fifty for India in the first T20I against New Zealand in Wellington in just 24 deliveries. She broke her own record of fastest T20I fifty for India in women\\'s cricket, which she had achieved against England in Mumbai in 2018. Though, Smriti Mandhana\\'s 58 and Jemimah Rodrigues\\' 39 went in vain as the Indian eves were bundled out for 136 in 19.1 overs. New Zealand Women defeated India by 23 runs in the first T20I. The overall record for the fastest fifty in womenâ€™s T20Is belongs to Sophie Devine of New Zealand who hit a half-century in 18 balls against India during a T20 International back in 2015."
