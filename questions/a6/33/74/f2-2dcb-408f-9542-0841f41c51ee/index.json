  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect </u>because Uchchatar Avishkar Yojna (UAY) is not an initiative by Ministry of Science and Technology but by the Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u>. The UAY aims to foster the growth of industrial sectors in India with the help of IITs. There is no limit on the project size taken under the scheme; however, as per the funding mechanism, the overall investment follows a pattern which includes 25% of the contribution by the respective Industry/industries; 25% by the participating ministry and 50% by the HRD ministry."
