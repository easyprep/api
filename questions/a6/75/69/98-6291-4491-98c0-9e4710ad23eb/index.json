  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nUruguay round is a multi-lateral trade negotiations from 1986 to 1993 involving 123 countries. This was followed by the Doha round. Reduction of agricultural subsidies from the government to its agricultural communities was a major objective of the negotiation. Other objectives included protection of intellectual property and reducing restrictions on investment.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe WTO provides for special and differential treatment (S&amp;DT) for developing countries and also least developed countries (LDC). It includes provision of longer time period for agreement and commitment implementation and increasing trade opportunities. The reforms proposed by India calls for self-declaration of countries to avail this benefit. This comes after US calling for withdrawal of such provisions for India and China.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe Marrakesh agreement was signed as a culmination of the Uruguay Round of trade talks. It led to WTO creation. It was signed by 123 countries in 1994. The current reforms suggested by the countries call for resolving the issue of dominance in WTO by developed members and also unilateral trade actions by these countries. Such actions has resulted in the current tensions in the world scenario."
