  "question": "The Union Government has launched Ujjwala sanitary napkin initiative in which of the following states?",
  "option1": "Uttar Pradesh",
  "option2": "Odisha",
  "option3": "Jharkhand",
  "option4": "Haryana",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Odisha",
  "explanation": "Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan  has recently launched the Ujjwala Sanitary Napkin initiative in Bhubaneswar to improve female hygiene and health and employability of rural women. Under the new initiative, 100 manufacturing units will be set up at Common Service Centres (CSCs) covering 93 blocks in the State at an estimated cost of Rs 2.94 crore. Each manufacturing unit will employ five or six Ujjwala beneficiaries with an aim to provide employment to nearly 600 women across all districts. The women will first receive training in manufacturing and sale of sanitary napkins. Each facility will have the capacity to produce 1200-2000 pads per day and will have a sterilisation room to ensure that the napkins are sterilised before they are packed for use. The sanitary napkins will be priced at Rs 42 per pack of eight pads. This initiative will provide women with an opportunity to earn between Rs 5,000 and Rs 15,000 per month. Thus, the Central scheme will be a counter to the Odisha governmentâ€™s Khushi scheme, in which sanitary napkins are provided free of cost to female students of government and government-aided schools in the state."
