  "question": "With respect to India’s first successful surgery for Craniophagus, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>In craniophagus condition, the skulls and brains of twins are fused.</li>\n<li>It is a congenital abnormality.</li>\n<li>Craniophagus twins are genetically identical.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "All are incorrect",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nCraniophagus condition is characterised by fused skulls and brains. The separation of such twins is a medical challenge and very few successful cases have been recorded. India’s first success comes with the separation of Odisha’s Jagga and Balia. The surgery was performed at AIIMS.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nCraniophagus condition is a congenital abnormality i.e, a birth defect. It is a very rare case. Such cases can be detected during mid-pregnancy itself using normal ultrasound scanning. Many parents choose to terminate such pregnancies due to consideration of quality of life of such children.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nCraniophagus twins are genetically identical. They are always of the same sex. Advances in brain imaging, neurosurgical techniques, neuro-anaesthesia have enabled better chances of treating such conditions. The Odisha case took 2 years for treatment. It involved 75 doctors and 50 nurses."
