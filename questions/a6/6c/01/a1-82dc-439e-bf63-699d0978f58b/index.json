  "option3": "evaporation of water from atmospheric precipitation occurring in winter alone",
  "option4": "the axis of the earth is inclined more towards the sun in winter",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "the earth is closer to the sun in summer than in winter",
  "explanation": "Summer is warmer than winter (in each hemisphere) because the Sun\\'s rays hit the Earth at a more direct angle during summer than during winter and also because the days are much longer than the nights during the summer. These effects are due to the tilt of the Earth\\'s axis. Also the earth is closer to the sun in summer than in winter."
