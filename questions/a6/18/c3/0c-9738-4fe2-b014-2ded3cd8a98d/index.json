  "question": "Which of the following conditions are required to keep the seeds in good condition?",
  "option1": "Warm and dry",
  "option2": "Warm and wet",
  "option3": "Cool and dry",
  "option4": "Cool and wet",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Warm and wet",
  "explanation": "Seeds wait to germinate until three needs are met: water, correct temperature (warmth), and a good location. All seeds need water, oxygen, and proper temperature in order to germinate. Some seeds require proper light also. Some germinate better in full light while others require darkness to germinate. When a seed is exposed to the proper conditions, water and oxygen are taken in through the seed coat."
