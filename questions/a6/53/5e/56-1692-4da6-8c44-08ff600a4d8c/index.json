They have been serving as connectors for generations in Meghalaya. These bridges spans between 15 and 250 feet and are built over centuries. Primarily, the bridges are a means to cross streams and rivers & have also become world-famous tourist attractions. Now, new research investigates these structures and proposes to integrate them in modern architecture around the world, and potentially help make cities more environment-friendly."
