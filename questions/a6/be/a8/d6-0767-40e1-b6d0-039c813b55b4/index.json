  "explanation": "The first-ever One Belt One Road (OBOR) Summit will be held in Bejing, China on May 14 -15, 2017. The 29 heads of state including Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Myanmar and high-level delegations from Bangladesh and Nepal will attend the two-day Belt and Road Forum in China. Though, India will not attend the forum. The main reason behind Indiaâ€™s opposition towards the policy is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is a part of OBOR. The focus of the summit is to improve connectivity and cooperation amount Asian countries, Africa, China and Europe. The emphasis is on enhancing land as well as maritime routes. The policy is significant for China since it aims to boost domestic growth in the country."
