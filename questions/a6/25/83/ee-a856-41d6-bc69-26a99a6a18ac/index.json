Potti Sreeramulu, one of the activists demanding the formation of a Telugu-majority state, died on 16 December 1952 after undertaking a fast-unto-death. This resulted in the creation of the first state on linguistic basis for Telugu speaking people called Andhra State on October 1, 1953. It was later reorganized as Andhra Pradesh in 1956."
