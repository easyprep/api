  "question": "Which of the following would tend to increase Earth’s Albedo?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Increased Air Pollution</li>\r\n<li>Melting of Polar Ice caps</li>\r\n<li>Economic Pressure on Crops and Forests</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 & 2",
  "option2": "1 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "Albedo is the fraction of the solar radiation reflected back. Increased air pollution would cause global dimming and would reduce the solar radiation reflected back. Polar Ice Caps increase the Earth’s albedo. When Polar Icecaps get melted , the bare earth will reflect less solar light. Thus first two options are incorrect. We should note that over-pastured land and bare soil are more reflective of solar radiation than are crops and vegetation. A desert is much more reflective than a savanna or forest. If economic pressure on soil and vegetation increases, and drought then occurs, the effect overall is to increase the albedo of the surface."
