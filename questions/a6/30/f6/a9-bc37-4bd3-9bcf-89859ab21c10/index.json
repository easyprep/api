  "question": "Recently, the government decided to cut its gross borrowing for the budget year 2018-19 by Rs. 70,000 crore. With this reference, consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>When government borrows from the domestic sources, the increase in inflation is less in comparison to simply printing the money.</li>\r\n<li>Less borrowing by government provides strength to bond markets</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Both the given statements are correct. When government borrows from the domestic sources, the increase in inflation is less in comparison to simply printing the money- because printing money is inflationary as more money chases same amount of goods and services. Government\\'s recent decision also indicates strong signal for fiscal commitment and lesser pressure on bond yields, thus may result in higher yield on bonds in time to come."
