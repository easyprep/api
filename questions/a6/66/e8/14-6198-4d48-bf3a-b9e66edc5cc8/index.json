  "option1": "Indian Oil",
  "option2": "Bharat Petroleum",
  "option3": "Hindustan Petroleum",
  "option4": "Essar",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Indian Oil",
  "explanation": "The government-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) started doorstep delivery of diesel on a pilot basis in Pune and has thus became first company in India to provide such service after receiving clearance from the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO). IOC has started this service in Pune through a diesel dispenser mounted on a midsized truck along with a storage tank. Based on the response it gets during the three-month trial period in Pune, IOC may roll out the doorstep delivery of fuel to other cities of India. Potential customer for this service are 'static customers' like transport companies with large diesel consumption and shopping malls/commercial establishments that use diesel in gensets for producing electricity.",
