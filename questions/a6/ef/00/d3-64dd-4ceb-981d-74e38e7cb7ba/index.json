  "question": "Which of the following will increase the incidence of Eutrophication in rivers and lakes?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Use of Fertilizers in nearby farms</li>\r\n<li>Wastewater effluent</li>\r\n<li>Runoff from abandoned mines</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Water enriched with nutrients leads to Eutrophication. Decaying organic matter releases odorous gases and partially decomposed matter accumulates on the river or lakebed, hereby limiting water’s suitability for human consumption and other uses. High levels of fertilizer use has been associated with increased incidence of Eutrophication in rivers and lakes in several of India’s most important water bodies, such as the Hussein Sagar in Hyderabad and Nain ital in Uttar Pradesh (MOWR 2000)."
