  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nSHAKTI is a coal linkage policy that was approved by the government in 2018. It stands for Scheme for Harnessing and Allocating Koyala Transparently in India. The coal linkage scheme will ensure availability of coal to thermal power plants in India.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nBoth public and private units can benefit from the SHAKTI scheme. Coal linkages are awarded to state discoms which then allocates it to state owned power generation plants and auctions it to private units. The bidders will give discounts on their tariffs to win linkages."
