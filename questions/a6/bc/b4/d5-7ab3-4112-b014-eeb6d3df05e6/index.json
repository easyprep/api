  "question": "Optical Fibre technology works on which of these principles of Physics?",
  "option1": "Bernoulli's Principle",
  "option2": "Newton's law of Motion",
  "option3": "Total internal reflection of Light",
  "option4": "Photoelectric effect",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Total internal reflection of Light",
  "explanation": "Optical Fibre technology works on the principle of Total internal reflection of Light. It helps in transmitting light signals from one place to another with a negligible loss of energy, thereby enabling to carry more signals than copper cables."
