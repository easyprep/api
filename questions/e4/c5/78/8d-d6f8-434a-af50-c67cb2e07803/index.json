  "option1": "Bihar",
  "option2": "West Bengal",

  "answer": "Jharkhand",
  "explanation": "There should be a tribal welfare minister in the following states: Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. Initially, this provision was applicable to Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. The 94th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2006 exculdedÂ Bihar from the obligation of having a tribal welfare minister as there are no Scheduled Areas in Bihar now and the fraction of population of the Scheduled Tribes is very small."
