  "question": "Two man start together to walk a certain distance, one at 4 km/hr and another at 3 km/hr. The former arrives half an hour before the latter. Find the distance.",
  "option1": "6 km",
  "option2": "7 km",
  "option3": "8 km",
  "option4": "9 km",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "6 km",
  "explanation": "If the required distance be x km, then \r\n$latex \\\\frac{x}{3} - \\\\frac{x}{4} = \\\\frac{1}{2}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{4x-3x}{12} = \\\\frac{1}{2}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{x}{12} = \\\\frac{1}{2}&s=1$\r\n$latex => x = 6 km$\r\nHence option [A] is correct answer."
