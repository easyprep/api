  "explanation": "Development of women and children in Rural Areas (DWCRA) was launched as a sub scheme of IRDP during the year 1982-83 in 50 districts. It subsequently extended to cover all the districts in the country by 1994-95. The flow of benefits to poor women, in spite of reservation, under various poverty alleviation programmes viz. IRDP and TRYSEM were found to be not making much impact."
