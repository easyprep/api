  "question": "The world's first negative emissions plant that turns CO2 into stone has opened in which country?",
  "option1": "United States",
  "option2": "Norway",
  "option3": "Iceland",
  "option4": "Russia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Iceland",
  "explanation": "The world\\'s first negative emissions plant that turns carbon dioxide (CO2) into stone has begun operations in Hellisheidi, Iceland. In it, the CO2 is captured from ambient air, bound to water, and sent to more than 700 meters underground. There, the CO2 reacts with the basaltic bedrock and forms solid minerals, creating a permanent storage solution. Currently, the pilot system captures only 50 metric tons CO2, each year, about the same emitted by a single US household."
