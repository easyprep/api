  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "It was a silent non-violent protest that began in the forests of Uttar Pradesh, in 1973 in which women clung to trees to prevent their indiscriminate felling for commercial purposes. It was a spontaneous movement and was not organized.The movement was a result of hundreds of decentralized and locally autonomous initiatives. Its leaders and activists were primarily village women, acting to save their means of subsistence and their communities. The unique feature of this movement was its silent non-violent protest against ecological destruction. The movement gained prominence in 1980, when the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, declared a 15-year ban on tree-felling in the Himalayan forests of Uttar Pradesh. The movement later spread to Himachal Pradesh in the north, Karnataka in the south, Rajasthan in the west, Bihar in the east, and the Vindhyas in central India. In addition to the ban in Uttar Pradesh, the movement succeeded in preempting the felling activities in the Western Ghats and the Vindhyas, as well as generating pressure for a natural resources policy that would be more sensitive to people&#8217;s needs and the environment."
