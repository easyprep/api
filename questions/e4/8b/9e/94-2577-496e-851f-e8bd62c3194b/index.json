This novel Solar PV system makes use of side walls of CW channels as load bearing structure thereby significantly decreasing cost of civil and mounting structure.  The system also has several other unique advantages such as land conservation and water conservation due to reduced evaporation. It also increases PV generation due to cooling from the water and a reduction in dirt."
