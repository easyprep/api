At the Centre, the legislative council had absolutely no control over the Governor-General or his executive council. Subjects were classified into two categories- the reserved subjects and the transferred subjects. The reserved subjects included subjects such as land revenue, finance, law and order and irrigation. These subjects were to be administered by the Governor and the executive council. The transferred subjects included subjects such as public health, education, industry, agriculture, local government and were to be administered by elected members of the council."
