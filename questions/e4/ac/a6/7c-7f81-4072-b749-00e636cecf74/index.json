  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Kigali Agreement is the amendment of the Montreal Protocol. The agreement was reached in 2016 during the meeting over Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. It calls for phasing out hydrofluorocarbons/ HFCs. This is a harmful substance, more than carbon dioxide, to the ozone.<br /><br />\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Kigali agreement is binding on the signatory parties. India is also a signatory to this agreement. It aims to reduce the HFCs by 2024 by about 85%. The non-compliant members are subject to penalties. The agreement sets differential deadlines for the countries with the richer countries facing quicker deadlines.\n&nbsp;"
