Mr Zelensky is best known for starring in a satirical television series ‘Servant of the People’ in which his character accidentally becomes Ukrainian president. The pressure will now be on Mr Zelensky to demonstrate that he knows what he is doing. Throughout the election campaign, he avoided serious interviews and discussions about policy - preferring instead to post light-hearted videos to social media."
