  "question": "The magnetic North Pole recently crossed the Prime Meridian. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Shifting of magnetic poles affects the functioning of GPS.</li>\n<li>The magnetic North Pole is currently drifting towards Russia.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe magnetic North Pole has a vital role in directing navigation systems around the world. Air transport is one of the most dependent sectors on such navigation system. It is based on the position of the magnetic poles that the GPS (Global Positioning System) is calibrated.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe magnetic North Pole had recently crossed the Prime Meridian from the Canadian Arctic region. It is predicted to move towards the Russian region. The magnetic North Pole was discovered in 1831 and since then, it has drifted for about 2,250km."
