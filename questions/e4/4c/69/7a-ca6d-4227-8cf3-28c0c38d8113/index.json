  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "Community Reserves are one of the 4 kinds of protected areas mentioned in the Wildlife Protection Act,. The Environment Protection Act, 1986 does not mention the word “Eco-sensitive Zones”. The section 3(2)(v) of the Act, says that Central Government can restrict areas in which any industries, operations or processes or class of industries, operations or processes shall not be carried out or shall be carried out subject to certain safeguards, and this has been used indirectly to declare ecosensitive zones. Similarly there is no legislation that fixed the Biosphere reserves in India."
