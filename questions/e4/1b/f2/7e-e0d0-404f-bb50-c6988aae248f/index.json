  "question": "Overall ageing of a population can be prompted by __?",
  "option1": "Rise in fertility rate and decline in mortality rate",
  "option2": "Decline in fertility rate and rise in mortality rate",
  "option3": "Rise in both fertility and mortality rates",
  "option4": "Decline in both fertility and mortality rates",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Decline in both fertility and mortality rates",
  "explanation": "Population ageing is a shift in the distribution of a country&#8217;s population towards older ages. This is usually reflected in an increase in the population&#8217;s mean and median ages, a decline in the proportion of the population composed of children, and a rise in the proportion of the population that is elderly. It occurs when the median age of a country or region rises due to rising life expectancy (i.e. decline in mortality) and/or declining birth rates. Thus option D is correct. It is an oft-remarked feature of the more-developed world, with implications such as the increasing tax burden placed on the working age population, allied to increasing needs for specialist social, health and personal services for the growing elderly."
