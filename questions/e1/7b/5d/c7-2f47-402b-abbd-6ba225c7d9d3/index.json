  "question": "Consider the following:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Quartzite</li>\r\n<li>Gneiss</li>\r\n<li>Schists</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above are called the metamorphic rocks?",
  "option1": "1 only",
  "option2": 1,
  "option3": "1 & 2",
  "option4": "1,2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1,2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Quartzite? Quartzite is a hard metamorphic rock which was originally sandstone. Sandstone is converted into quartzite through heating and pressure usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts. Pure quartzite is usually white to grey, though quartzites often occur in various shades of pink and red due to varying amounts of iron oxide (Fe2O3). Other colors are commonly due to impurities of minor amounts of other minerals.\r\nGneiss? Gneiss is a common and widely distributed type of rock formed by high-grade regional metamorphic processes from pre-existing formations that were originally either igneous or sedimentary rocks.\r\nSchists? The schists form a group of medium-grade metamorphic rocks, chiefly notable for the preponderance of lamellar minerals such as micas, chlorite, talc, hornblende, graphite, and others. Quartz often occurs in drawn-out grains to such an extent that a particular form called quartz schist is produced. By definition, schist contains more than 50% platy and elongated minerals, often finely interleaved with quartz and feldspar."
