  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 Only",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because the project is headed by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

The work on BEPS focuses largely on legal tax planning techniques rather than offshore tax evasion, which is illegal."
