  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "1 & 2",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "This question is very simple but wants you to apply your knowledge of the torrid zones, temperate zones and Frigid zones. We know that the tropic of Cancer currently lies 23° 26′ 16″ north of the Equator. The Tropical zone or torrid zone is located between 23½°N and 23½°S. The sun is vertical at least once in a year at EVERY place in this zone. In the above question, the three cities viz. Chennai, Nagpur and Mumbai fall within this definition and are thus located in Torrid Zone. So the correct answer is these three cities. Please note that in temperate zone which lies from 23½°N to 66½°N and 23½°S to 66½°S , sun is NEVER vertical. In the frigid zones, the length of the day or night at least once in a year is hour duration."
