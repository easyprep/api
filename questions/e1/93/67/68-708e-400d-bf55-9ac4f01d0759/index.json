  "question": "While playing a flute, the flute player opens and closes the holes in the body of the flute to make changes in __:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Pitch</li>\r\n<li>Resonant Frequency</li>\r\n<li>Timbre</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "<p class=\\\"Explanation\\\">The player changes the pitch of the sound produced by opening and closing holes in the body of the instrument, thus changing the effective length of the resonator and its corresponding resonant frequency. By varying the air pressure, a flute player can also change the pitch of a note by causing the air in the flute to resonate at a harmonic other than the fundamental frequency without opening or closing any holes. Please note that Timbre is “quality” which differentiates two different instruments producing the sound of same frequency, playing the same note at the same loudness. Closing one or more holes downstream of the first open hole also gives different timbre to adjacent notes."
