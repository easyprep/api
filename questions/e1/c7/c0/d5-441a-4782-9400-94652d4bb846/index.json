  "question": "The recently developed self-powered sensor for detecting blood sugar levels by CECRI makes use of which enzyme?",
  "option1": "Invertase",
  "option2": "Glucose oxidase",
  "option3": "Alcohol dehydrogenase",
  "option4": "Amylase",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Glucose oxidase",
  "explanation": "CECRI (Central Electrochemical Research Institute, Karaikudi) developed a self-powered sensor for glucose. It makes use of an enzyme called glucose oxidase. Unlike conventional sensors, it doesnâ€™t required batteries to power its function. The sensor was developed by coupling a polymer with the catalytic enzyme."
