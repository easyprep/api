  "option1": "1, 4, 3, 2",
  "option2": "4, 1, 2, 3",
  "option3": "4, 1, 3, 2",
  "option4": "1, 4, 2, 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "4, 1, 3, 2",
  "explanation": "The correct sequence in decreasing order of the albedo values of these ecosystems are Tundra, Taiga, Tropical deciduous and Tropical evergreen.<br />Taiga, generally referred to in North America as boreal forest or snow forest, is a biome characterized by coniferous forests consisting mostly of pines, spruces, and larches. The taiga or boreal forest is the world\\'s largest land biome.<br />The tropical evergreen forests usually occur in areas receiving more than 200 cm of rainfall and having a temperature of 15 to 30 degrees Celsius. They occupy about seven per cent of the earth\\'s land surface and habours more than half of the world\\'s plants and animals.<br />Tropical deciduous forests occur in regions with heavy rainfall for part of the year followed by a marked dry season. These forest formations are dense and lush during the wet summers, but become a dry landscape during the dry winters when most trees shed their leaves.<br />Tundra is a type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term tundra comes through Russian from the Kildin."
