  "option1": "1 and 2",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1, 2 and 4",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 and 3",
  "explanation": "‘Neap Tides’ occur when the Sun and the Moon are at right angles to each other that is in ‘Quadrature’ and when the moon is in Apogee or the Sun is in Apehelion. (Hence Statement 1. is incorrect and Statement 2. is correct) When Quadrature and Apogee happen at the same time, exceptionally low tides are formed. (Hence Statement 4. is incorrect)"
