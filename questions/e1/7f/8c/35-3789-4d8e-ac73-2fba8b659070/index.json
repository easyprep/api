  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nIndia had delivered 30,000 doses of Measles Rubella vaccine to Maldives to tackle the sudden outbreak of Measles in the country. The doses were delivered in 72 hours as part of the Neighbourhood First Policy. The MR vaccine is a less common version. The more common version is MMR vaccine which also provides immunity against mumps.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nMaldives is a measles free country according to WHO. The country was declared measles free in 2017. A country is declared measles free if there arenâ€™t any endemic transmission of the virus for a period of 12 months. However, until the virus is eradicated from all countries that have endemic transmissions, the danger cannot be completely eliminated."
