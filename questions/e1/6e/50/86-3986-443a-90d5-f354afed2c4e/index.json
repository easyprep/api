  "option1": "Kenya",
  "option2": "Chad",
  "option3": "Gambia",
  "option4": "Gabon",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Gabon",
  "explanation": "The Ecosystem and Relict Cultural Landscape of Lope-Okanda are the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Gabon. The Ecosystem and Relict Cultural Landscape of Lope-Okanda demonstrates an unusual interface between the dense and well-conserved tropical rainforest and relict savannah environments with a great diversity of species, including endangered large mammals, and habitats. The site illustrates ecological and biological processes in terms of species and habitat adaptation to post-glacial climatic changes. It contains evidence of the successive passages of different peoples who have left extensive and comparatively well-preserved remains of habitation around hilltops, caves and shelters, evidence of iron-working and a remarkable collection of some 1,800 petroglyphs (rock carvings). The propertyâ€™s collection of Neolithic and Iron Age sites, together with the rock art found there, reflects a major migration route of Bantu and other peoples from West Africa along the River Ogooue valley to the north of the dense evergreen Congo forests and to central-east and southern Africa, that has shaped the development of the whole of sub-Saharan Africa."
