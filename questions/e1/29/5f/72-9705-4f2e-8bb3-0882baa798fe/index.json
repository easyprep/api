  "question": "Which of the following is / are correct observations with respect to the closed fuel cycle in terms of nuclear energy?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The spent fuel is re-processed to recover useful fissile and fertile materials to use again in reactors</li>\r\n<li>The spent fuel re-processed from Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) can be used as nuclear fuel in fast breeder reactors</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "As a policy, India has adopted a closed fuel cycle, where the spent fuel is regarded as a resource material and thus no spent fuel is disposed off. All the spent fuel is re-processed to recover useful fissile and fertile materials to recycle back in the reactor as a fuel. For the spent fuel from indigenous Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) the balance, other than fissile and fertile materials, amounts to barely about half percent of the original mass of the nuclear fuel. This too is converted and contained in stable glass form through a process of vitrification. The recovered fissile and fertile material in the form of Uranium and Plutonium is used as nuclear fuel in fast breeder reactors"
