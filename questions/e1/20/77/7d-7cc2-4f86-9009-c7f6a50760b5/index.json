  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about Fronts?<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The formation of fronts is called as Frontolysis</li>\r\n<li>The dissipation of fronts is called as Frontogenesis</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The boundary zone when two different type of air masses meet is called a Front. The process of its formation is known as frontogenesis. The Dissipation of a front is known as Frontolysis.Â <br />Frontogenesis involves convergence of two distinct air masses.<br />Frontolysis involves overriding of one of the air mass by another."
