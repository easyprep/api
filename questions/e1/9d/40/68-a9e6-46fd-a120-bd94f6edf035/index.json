  "explanation": "In a bid to attract more Buddhist tourists from across the world, Central Government has decided to expand Buddhist tourism circuit to 21 more states. Buddhist Circuit is among the thirteen thematic circuits under central Government's Swadesh Darshan Scheme. As per earlier plan, it comprised only seven major Buddhist pilgrimage sites in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. However, now the circuit will be expanded as Union Ministry of Tourism has identified stupas and viharas in 21 states, around which small intra-state Buddhist zones will be developed. Some of these states are Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Goa, Gujarat and Jammu & Kashmir. Objective behind expanding Buddhist circuit is to attract more Buddhist tourists, particularly the new-age Buddhist tourists from the West, and also from traditional markets in South East Asia. Among these states, most noteworthy is the plan to create a Buddhist theme park in Madhya Pradesh, which will have light and sound show, interpretation centre, wayside amenities and sanitation facilities.",
