  "option1": "Punjab",
  "option2": "Rajasthan",
  "option3": "Sikkim",
  "option4": "Kerala",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Sikkim",
  "explanation": "Sikkim has won the Gold at the 2018 FAO’s Future Policy Award (FPA) for its achievement in becoming the world\\'s first totally organic agriculture state. All of its farmland is certified organic. At the same time, Sikkim\\'s approach reaches beyond organic production and has proven truly transformational for the state and its citizens. Uniquely, the state has totally banned the sale and use of chemical pesticides. The transition has benefitted more than 66 000 farming families. The Sikkim tourism sector has benefitted greatly from the state’s transition to 100 percent organic:  the number of tourists increased by over 50% between 2014 and 2017. Sikkim beat out 51 other nominees from around the world for the award. Brazil, Denmark, Quito and Ecuador shared the Silver award. Nicknamed the \\\"Oscar for best policies\\\", the award is co-organised with the FAO by The World Future Council (WFC) and IFOAM -- Organics International, and recognises \\\"the world\\'s best laws and policies promoting agroecology\\\"."
