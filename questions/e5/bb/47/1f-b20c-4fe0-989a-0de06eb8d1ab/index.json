  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 & 4",
  "explanation": "Southwest monsoon is responsible for experiencing rainfall in India and accounts for nearly 80% rainfall of the whole of India. The reason for its origin are the vast size of Indian continent, which helps in developing the thermal gradient necessary to attract the vapour laden air from sea. Presence of the Himalayas in the north, extending in an east-west direction, thus creating a physical barrier between tropical and polar air masses. These barriers induce the precipitation of water from moisture laden air. As the air climb up the Himalayas their moisture retention capacity decreases which results into high rainfall.</span>"
