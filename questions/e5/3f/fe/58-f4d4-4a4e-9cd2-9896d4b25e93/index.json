  "option2": "2 and 3",

  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nIn 1974, the Bilateral Protocol on Visits to Religious Shrines was introduced by the governments of India and Pakistan. It allows pilgrims access to certain listed shrines on both sides of the border. Currently the list covers 20 shrines- 15 in Pakistan and 5 in India. The government will provide visas to the pilgrims for these visits. The number of pilgrims allowed is also restricted.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe Pant-Mirza agreement was signed in 1974 under the bilateral protocol. It mandates the preservation and maintenance of the listed shrines by the host country. The Nankana Sahib shrine is one of the listed shrines. This year, Pakistan has issued 500 visas more than the prescribed number under the protocol in recognition of the upcoming 550<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Guru Nanak.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nKartarpur shrine is not included in the protocol list. It is located 3km away from the border on Pakistan’s side. The Indian pilgrims use four binocular sites on Indian side at the Dera Baba Nanak for viewing the shrine. The two countries are working to establish a visa free corridor to enable access to the shrine, commemorating the 550<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Guru Nanak.\n&nbsp;"
