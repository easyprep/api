  "question": "Many features of the Indus Valley civilization show its organized nature of the internal distribution network. Which among the following is / are included in such features?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Standardized system of weights and measures</li>\r\n<li>Wooden carts drawn by Oxen</li>\r\n<li>Pottery making by specialized potters</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "All the statements are true in above question. Pottery for everyday use was probably manufactured in every settlement and certainly in all the towns and cities. The highly organized nature of the Indus civilization is clear from the fact that even these simple everyday wares were manufactured in pottery workshops by specialized potters, rather than being made in the home. Although pottery throughout the Harappan polity shared many features, these local wares are more variable and there are some regional or local styles. In contrast, some special wares seem to have been produced in one or a few centers for widespread distribution: for example, blackslipped storage vessels were made at Harappa (and possibly only there) and were also used in external trade. Often, individual workshops concentrated on particular types. Another insight into the organized nature of the internal distribution network is provided by the existence of a standardized system of weights and measures, used throughout the Indus realms. Terra-cotta models show that the Harappans used a range of wooden carts with solid wheels, drawn by oxen, to transport goods and sometimes people over short distances. Modern wooden components have been added to this model to replace those used by the Harappans, which have long since decayed away."
