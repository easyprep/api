  "question": "From which element in the modern periodic table, the 3d transition series starts?",
  "option1": "Zinc",
  "option2": "Iron",
  "option3": "Scandium",
  "option4": "Copper",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Scandium",
  "explanation": "The 3d transition series starts from scandium (Z = 21) and completes at zinc (Z=30). Reason for this transition series is that before the 4p orbital is filled, filling up of 3d orbitals becomes energetically favourable."
