  "question": "The speed of a boat in still water is 10 km/hr. It covers (upstream) a distance of 45 km in 6 hours. The speed (in km/hr) of the stream is :",
  "option1": "3.5 kmph",
  "option2": "4 kmph",
  "option3": "5 kmph",
  "option4": "2.5 kmph",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2.5 kmph",
  "explanation": "Upstream speed of boat = $latex \\\\frac{Distance}{Time}=\\\\frac{45}{6}=\\\\frac{15}{2}&s=1$\r\n                       =7.5 kmph\r\nSpeed Of Current = 10-7.5 = 2.5 kmph\r\nHence option [D] is the right answer."
