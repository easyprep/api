  "answer": "Indonesia and Timor-Leste",
  "explanation": "The Ombai Strait and Ombai Strait Transboundary Corridor is located at the nexus between the Indian and Pacific Oceans between Indonesia ( the islands of Alor, West Timor and Wetar) and Timor-Leste. This strait has been identified as critical habitat for endangered, threatened and protected species-including sperm whales, blue whales, marine turtles, whale shark and mantas. This strait is also a major exit for the Indonesia throughflow: a unique oceanic exchange current between the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans which results in strong seasonal upwelling and persistent pelagic habitats of importance to migratory and resident cetaceans and to other large marine life. This strait connects the Banda Sea in the north and to the Savu Sea to the southwest."
