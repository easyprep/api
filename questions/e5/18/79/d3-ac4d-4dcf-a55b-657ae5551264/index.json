  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 1",
  "option3": "Only 3",
  "option4": "None of them",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "Eugenics<br />Eugenics refers to the belief and practice of improving the genetic quality of the human population. Eugenics is basically a social philosophy that advocates that human traits can be improved by promotion of higher reproduction of people with desired traits (positive eugenics), and reduced reproduction of people with less-desired or undesired traits (negative eugenics). Eugenics does not involve actually manipulating genes, and cloning etc.<br />Euthenics<br />Euthenics is the study of the improvement of human functioning and well-being by improvement of living conditions. Affecting the “improvement” through altering external factors such as education and the controllable environment, including the prevention and removal of contagious disease and parasites, environmentalism, education regarding employment, home economics, sanitation, and housing. Thus this has to be opted out.<br />Euphenics<br />Euphenics is something to do with the Genetic diseases. It refers to phenotypic improvements to humans after birth, generally to effect a problematic genetic condition. Thus, symptomatic treatment of genetic diseases of man is called euphenics . The euphenics deals with the control of several inherited human diseases, especially inborn errors of metabolism in which the missing or defective enzyme has been identified."
