  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Arid and Semi-arid",
  "explanation": "Most regions of nomadic herding have an arid or semi-arid climate with a rainfall of less than 50 cm. Due to this trees are not found over large areas and grasses and shrubs are the dominant life form of vegetation. In fact in most of the areas even pastures are scanty. Therefore, a constant movement of flocks in search of pastures is necessary."
