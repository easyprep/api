  "option3": "3 4 2 1",
  "option4": "4 3 2 1",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "3 4 1 2",
  "explanation": "The oxidation number characterizes the oxidation state of an element in a compound. It is a full number, positive or negative, which indicates the amount of electron loss or gain by this element in the given compound, with respect to the neutral atom. Oxidation number of calcium is 2 in calcium oxide (CaO). Oxidation number of Aluminium is +3 in Sodium aluminium hydride (NaAlH4) is a chemical compound used as a reducing agent. <br />Oxidation number of manganese is 4 in Manganese dioxide (MnO2). <br />Oxidation number of sulphur is 6 in Pyrosulfuric Acid (H2S2O7)."
