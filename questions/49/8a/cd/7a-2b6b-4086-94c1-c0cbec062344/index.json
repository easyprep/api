  "question": "With reference to the south Asian countries’ aim to promote hydrogen fueled vehicles, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Hydrogen fueled vehicles are a cleaner option than electric vehicles.</li>\n<li>Explosion risk is a major factor impeding the growth of hydrogen fueled vehicles.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe combustion of hydrogen fuel yields only water as a by-product. This makes it a cleaner energy source. China, Japan and South Korea have made major plans to introduce hydrogen fuel cell vehicles/ FCV in a decade. China is the largest auto market and most of its FCVs are buses. The countries are in plans to send millions to achieve the target.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe major factors impeding the FCVs’ main stream use are explosion risks, few commercial makers, building expenses, lack of refuelling infrastructure, etc. Several explosions have occurred in the past because of hydrogen fuel- eg: in South Korea and in Norway.\n&nbsp;"
