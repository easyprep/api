  "question": "Camel uses its hump for which of the following purposes?",
  "option1": "Storing water",
  "option2": "storing fat",
  "option3": "balancing the body during walking in desert sand",
  "option4": "temperature regulation",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "storing fat",
  "explanation": "A camel\\'s hump does not hold water at all - it actually stores fat. The camel uses it as nourishment when food is scarce. If a camel uses the fat inside the hump, the hump will become limp and droop down. The hump is not used for water storage, but camels can go for long periods of time without water."
