  "answer": "Macedonia",
  "explanation": "On 6th February, Macedonia signed an accord to join NATO to become the 30th member of the US-led alliance. The admittance of a new member highlighted that all European nations who meet the entrance criteria could join the regional alliance. However, Moscow has continually rejected NATO\\'s position, saying that by taking in Balkan members, the alliance is undermining security in the region.The Macedonia-NATO accord follows a deal with Greece ending a 27-year-old dispute over Macedonia\\'s name. The accord must now be ratified by allied governments. The move followed a deal between Macedonia and NATO-member Greece under which Macedonia agreed to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia.  North Macedonia will formally join the alliance in 2020."
