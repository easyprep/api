Also, the Consolidation of University Research for Innovation and Excellence in women universities (CURIE) is another component of KIRAN that has a focus to develop state-of-the-art infrastructure to help large number of women to enhance their S&amp;T skills and knowledge in order to make a fulfilling career in this domain besides promoting research culture in such institutions. Further, KIRAN is providing budgetary support for creating Women Technology Park (WTP) where appropriate S&amp;T packages for women are developed to improve livelihood and health &amp; nutrition besides reducing drudgery."
