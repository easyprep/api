  "question": "A boatman rows 1 km in 5 minutes, along the stream and 6 km in 1 hour against the stream. The speed of the strean is :",
  "option1": "12 km/hr",
  "option2": "10 km/hr",
  "option3": "6 km/hr",
  "option4": "3 km/hr",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "3 km/hr",
  "explanation": "Speed of current = $latex \\\\frac{Rate Downstream - Rate Upstream }{2}&s=1$\r\n$latex =>\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left ( 12-6 \\\\right )&s=1$\r\n$latex =>\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\times 6=3 km/hr&s=1$\r\nHence option [D] is the right answer."
