  "question": "Consider the following observations:<br> 1.Albedo of clouds is lesser to that of soils<br> 2.The oceans have a low Albedo in comparison to Deserts<br> 3.The Tropical Rainforests have the lowest albedo on the Earth<br> Which among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "First statement is basic and incorrect. Oceans have a lower albedo than deserts, this is a correct statement. The tropical Rainforests have a low Albedo and as such, more solar radiation is absorbed. A percentage in the region of 5-15% is estimated as the albedo for tropical forests. With deforestation, the albedo decreases further and studies have shown that the temperature of a deforested area actually increases by 5Â°F over a year. An increase in surface temperature will lead to warm air which will rise, leading to low, cooler pressure areas."
