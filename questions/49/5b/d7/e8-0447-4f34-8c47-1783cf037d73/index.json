  "question": "Recently, Israeli scientists developed bacteria that feed on carbon dioxide. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>These are E.coli bacteria.</li>\n<li>They feed require sugar for survival.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Israeli scientists genetically engineered Escherichia coli bacteria to feed on carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Apart from genetic engineering, they also made use of ‘laboratory evolution’ process to develop this trait among the succeeding generations of this bacteria.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThese bacteria are completely weaned off of sugar. Initially they required sugar but succeeding generations only required carbon dioxide and a substance called formate for energy generation. This is expected to aid in the action against climate change."
