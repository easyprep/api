  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "In order to prevent cruelty against the milch animals, government has banned imports of the hormone oxytocin. Oxytocin is a mammalian hormone. It is often called “love hormone”. It is used widely by the dairy farmers as injecting substance in milch animals to increase the milk production. But as per research it has been also found that the oxytocin injection causes hormonal imbalances and shortens the lives of milch animals. Oxytocin is a naturally occurring hormone in the human body. It is often used as drug for many other illegal activities in the country. It is injected in girls who are used for flesh trade. It is used to speed births. Also, it is used by farmers to plump up vegetables like pumpkin and bottle gourd. So, the government decided to reduce the over usage in the country and banned its import."
