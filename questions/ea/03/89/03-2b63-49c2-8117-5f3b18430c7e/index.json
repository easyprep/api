  "question": "All metals are good conductors of heat. What could be the reason(s) behind this? <br> 1.The molecules in them collide very freely<br> 2.They contain free electrons<br> 3.The molecules in them are very close to each other<br> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "All metals are good conductors of heat because they contain free electrons so the transfer of heat becomes easy and the molecules in them are very close to each other so the heat transfer becomes more efficient."
