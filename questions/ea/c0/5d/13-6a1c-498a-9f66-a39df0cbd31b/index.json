  "question": "Which among the following was first human-made plastic?",
  "option1": "Bakelite",
  "option2": "Polyethene",
  "option3": "Celluloid",
  "option4": "Nylon",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Celluloid",
  "explanation": "he first human-made plastic was made by Alexander Parkes in 1855, when he synthesized celluloid. The new discovery found its use in photographic films, but it could not be used for making containers or insulators for electric circuits.\r\nThe first true plastic was made in 1909 by Leo Baekeland, who synthesized Bakelite. The hard plastic could be used to make handles, auto parts, etc. The First World War witnessed improvements in the manufacture of polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride, which found use in plumbing equipment and electric wire insulation. Nylon was synthesized in the 1930s. By 1950, plastics became quite popular and as a result we can see them everywhere today"
