  "answer": "Greece",
  "explanation": "The Mines of Laurion are ancient mines located in southern Attica in Greece. The mines are best known for producing silver, but they were also a source of copper and lead. The mines were exploited in prehistoric times as a source of copper and galena, a lead ore. In the classical period, mining in the area resumed. The Athenians used large numbers of slaves to mine the area, with the silver produced contributing significantly to the city's wealth. Abandoned in the 1st century BC, the mines were reactivated in 1864 and mined for their lead by French and Greek companies until 1978.",
