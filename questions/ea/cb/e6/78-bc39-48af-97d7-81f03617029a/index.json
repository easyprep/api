  "question": "Consider the following pairs:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Sweat - Eccrine glands</li>\r\n<li>Tears - Lacrimal glands</li>\r\n<li>Neurohormones - Hypothalamus</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The lacrimal-glands are paired, almond-shaped glands, one for each eye, that secrete the aqueous-layer of the tear film. The hypothalamus secretes substances known as neurohormones that start and stop the secretion of pituitary hormones. When our body temperature rises, Eccrine glands present in our body secrete fluid on the surface of our skin. The fluid is called sweat and is mainly composed of water and salt."
