  "question": "The researchers at which IIT has produce collagen from waste eel skin?",
  "option1": "IIT-Hyderabad",
  "option2": "IIT-Indore",
  "option3": "IIT-Kanpur",
  "option4": "IIT-Delhi",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "IIT-Hyderabad",
  "explanation": "The researchers at the IIT-Hyderabad have derived collagen from discarded skin of eel (a snake like fish)  by treating it with acetic acid, common salt and pepsin. It then combined the collagen with alginate hydrogel and used a 3D printing process to obtain scaffolds. They shown that tissue scaffolds built using such collagen allow growth and proliferation of stem cells. Thus, eel-skin derived collagen is a promising biomaterial for tissue engineering applications. The research was funded by the Central government\\'s Department of Science and Technology-Science and Engineering Research Board (DST-SERB) through the National Postdoctoral Fellowship Scheme (N-PDF). The practical applications of this research can lead to utilizing eel fish skin-derived collagen as a promising alternative to animal derived collagen, which are expensive and are associated with pathological diseases. Collagen is a protein found especially in the joints of humans and animals."
