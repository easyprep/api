  "question": "What is the relation between Time period(T) and angular frequency(<span class='symbol'>ω</span>) of a wave?",
  "option1": "T = 2π/<span class=\\'symbol\\'>ω</span>",
  "option2": "T = 2π<span class=\\'symbol\\'>ω</span>",
  "option3": "T = π/2<span class=\\'symbol\\'>ω</span>",
  "option4": "T = <span class=\\'symbol\\'>ω</span>",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "T = 2π/<span class=\\'symbol\\'>ω</span>",
  "explanation": "Period T of oscillation of a wave is defined as the time any element of the medium takes to move through one complete oscillation. It is related to the angular frequency <span class=\\'symbol\\'>ω</span> through the relation T = 2π/<span class=\\'symbol\\'>ω</span>."
