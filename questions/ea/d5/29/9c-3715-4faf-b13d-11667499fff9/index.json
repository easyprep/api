  "question": "What is the maximum life of an ordinance promulgated by President of India?",
  "option1": "6 months",
  "option2": "7.5 months",
  "option3": "8 months",
  "option4": "10 months",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "7.5 months",
  "explanation": "Article 123 of the Indian constitution empowers the President to promulgate ordinances. This mechanism has been devised to enable the executive to deal with a situation that may suddenly and immediately arise when the Parliament is not in session (either one or both houses). As maximum gap between two session of a house can be 6 months therefore maximum life of a ordinance can be 6 months and 6 weeks, which is roughly 7.5 months."
