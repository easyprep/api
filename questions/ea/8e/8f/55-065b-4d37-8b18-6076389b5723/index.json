  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe judiciary has a code of conduct. This was adopted in 1999 during the conference of chief justices. It is applicable to the judges of the high courts and the Supreme Court. The ‘Re-instatement of Values in Judicial Life’ consists of 15 points to be followed by the judges. It recommends that the judges maintain ‘aloofness’ in personal and official lives to ensure unbiased completion of their duty.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe common code of conduct is a work in progress. It will be framed using inputs from the Speakers and the Chairmen (of legislative assemblies and councils respectively). I will involve a panel of presiding officers. The code will help curb frequent interruptions in the proceedings.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nPakistan uses a code of conduct to regulate the behavior of its senate members. Similarly other countries around the world use codes of conduct. Eg: Germany, UK, USA, etc. The code of conduct is necessary given the multiparty system used by our polity.\n&nbsp;"
