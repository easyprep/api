  "question": "Which among the following pairs of Mud is/are correctly matched?<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Green Mud - It contains 35% of calcium carbonate.</li>\r\n<li>Blue Mud - It includes the materials derived through the disintegration of rocks rich in Iron Sulphide and organic elements.</li>\r\n<li>Red Mud - The sediments derived through the communition of rocks rich in iron oxides from red mud.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 2",

  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Murray has divided mud into 3 types on the basis of colour: <br />Red Mud - The reddish colour is mainly due to dominance of iron content. <br />Blue Mud -It contains 35% of calcium carbonate. It includes the materials derived through the disintegration of rocks rich in Iron Sulphide and organic elements.<br />Green Mud - formed due to chemical weathering wherein the colour of blue mud is changed to green mud due to reaction of sea water."
