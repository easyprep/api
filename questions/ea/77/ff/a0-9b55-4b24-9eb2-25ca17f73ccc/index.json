  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "Mechanical (physical) weathering is the physical disintegration and reduction in the size of the rocks without changing their chemical composition. <br />It includes exfoliation, frost wedging, salt wedging, temperature changes and abrasion<br /><br />Chemical weathering decomposes, dissolves, alters, or weakens the rock through chemical processes to form residual materials.<br />It includes carbonation, hydration, hydrolysis, oxidation and <strong>solution.</strong>"
