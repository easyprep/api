  "question": "Who among the following is most benefitted from inflation?",
  "option1": "Creditors",
  "option2": "Debtors",
  "option3": "Savings bank account holders",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Debtors",
  "explanation": "Debtors gain from inflation because they repay creditors with dollars that are worth less in terms of purchasing power. Anticipated inflation, inflation that is expected, results in a much smaller redistribution of income and wealth. Unanticipated inflation benefits government because government is a large debtor."
