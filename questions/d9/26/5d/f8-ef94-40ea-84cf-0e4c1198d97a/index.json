  "question": "Consider the following differences between monoculture and polyculture: <ol> <li>While monoculture increases soil erosion, polyculture enhances soil health</li> <li>While monoculture is highly susceptible to pest attacks, polyculture is highly resistant to pest attack</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Monoculture refers to growing single crop over a wide area throughout the year. Polyculture refers to crop rotation or planting different crops over the same piece of land in a year. <u>First statement is correct</u>. Monoculture increases the soil erosion because the same kind of crop decreases soil nutrients ability and underline soil structure. On the other hand, polyculture enhances soil health and suppresses weed growth. <u>Second statement is correct</u>. Since all the plants in monoculture are genetically similar, it is highly susceptible to pest attack; on the other hand, polyculture consisting of multiple crops shows wide resistant to pest attack."
