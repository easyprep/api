  "option2": "State Bank of India",
  "option3": "Reserve Bank of India",
  "option4": "Canara Bank",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Reserve Bank of India",
  "explanation": "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.0 percent. Consequently, the Reverse Repo Rate (RRR) under the LAF remains at 5.75 percent, and the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.25 percent. The projection of real GVA growth for 2017-18 of the October resolution at 6.7per cent has been retained, with risks evenly balanced. In the previous meeting in October, the RBI had maintained status quo on rates.",
