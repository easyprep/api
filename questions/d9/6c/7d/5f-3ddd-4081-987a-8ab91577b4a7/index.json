Aurangzeb was called “Zinda Pir” or “Living Saint” in Mughal India. Malik Kafur was a slave general of Allauddin Khilji. Malik Kafur won for Allauddin Khilji the Deccan territories of Devgiri. He was originally a Hindu slave and was bought for 1000 dinars by Allauddin’s General, Nusrat Khan, and so Malik Kafur is also known as Hazar Dinari."
