  "question": "Which of the following is/are the reason(s) for more deltas on the east coast in comparison to west coast of India? \r\n<ol>\r\n<li>High gradient for west flowing rivers in comparison to east flowing rivers</li>\r\n<li>Wider stretch of eastern coastal plains in comparison to west coastal plains</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n   Select the correct option from codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Deltas are formed due to accumulation of sediments brought by the rivers. The high gradient of west flowing rivers provides them high velocity due to which rivers carries sediments along with them instead of depositing them. Furthermore, shorter stretch of western coastal plains provides very less space for deposition of sediments hence; ending in forming estuaries and lagoons."
