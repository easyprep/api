During the hostage-taking and seizure of a brigade of the gendarmerie, members of an independence movement, the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front, assassinated four gendarmes (including two unarmed) and took 27 unarmed gendarmes hostages (weapons were in armoury during the night), later also taking hostage a public prosecutor and seven members of the French military unit. They demanded talks with the French government about independence for New Caledonia from France. In previous years, about ten gendarmes had been killed in New Caledonia in connection with the independence movement."
