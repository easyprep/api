  "answer": "P Chidambaram",
  "explanation": "The book titled ‘Undaunted: Saving the Idea of India’ has been authored by former finance minister P Chidambaram, which was recently released by former vice president Hamid Ansari. The book claimed that fear rules the country today and there is a danger that the Constitution will be replaced by a document inspired by Hindutva. According to the author, an economy derailed can be put back on the rails and a society divided can be healed and united but one thing cannot be fixed if it is broken, and that is the Constitution and the constitutional values embodied in that document. At present, every value of the Constitution is under attack -- freedom, equality, liberalism, secularism, privacy, scientific temper, etc."
