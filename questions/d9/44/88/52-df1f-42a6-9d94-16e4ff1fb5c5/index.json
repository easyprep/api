  "option1": "$latex 8\\%$",
  "option2": "$latex 6\\%$",
  "option3": "$latex 7\\%$",
  "option4": "$latex 5\\frac{1}{2}\\%$",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "$latex 7\\%$",
  "explanation": "Principal  = 1600 Rs. \r\nT = 2 years 3 months\r\n$latex = \\\\left ( 2+\\\\frac{3}{12} \\\\right )yrs. = \\\\left ( 2+\\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\right )yrs.  = \\\\frac{9}{4}yrs.&s=1$\r\nS.I = 252 Rs. \r\nR = % rate of interest per annum \r\n$latex => R = \\\\frac{100\\\\times S.I.}{P\\\\times t}&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{100 \\\\times 252}{1600 \\\\times \\\\frac{9}{4}} = 7\\\\%&s=1$\r\nRate of interest = 7% per annum\r\nHence option [C] is the right answer."
