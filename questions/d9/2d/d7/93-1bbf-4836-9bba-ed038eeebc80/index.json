  "question": "The Yettinahole project, which was frequently in news due to environmental issues, is an ambitious project of which state government?",
  "option1": "Maharashtra",
  "option2": "Telangana",
  "option3": "Karnataka",
  "option4": "Andhra Pradesh",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Karnataka",
  "explanation": "The Yettinahole project is an ambitious project of the Karnataka state government. The project is aimed at providing water from Yettinahole (Netravati) to the parched districts of south Karnataka. It envisages the construction of eight dams and its impact on the flora and fauna is bound to be negative. Yettinahole region is a part of Western Ghats and thus region of ecological importance. It is home to large number of plants and animal species, birds, frogs, butterflies, fish and snails. Since the river recharges the underground aqueduct, tanks and wells, it provides a habitat to lesser-known species and aquatic animals, so its diversion or making embankments to regulate its flow must be avoided."
