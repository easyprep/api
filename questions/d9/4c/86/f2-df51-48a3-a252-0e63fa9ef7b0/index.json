  "answer": "Japan",
  "explanation": "Japan will host the 2020 Summer Olympic Games. The 2020 Summer Olympics, officially the Games of the XXXII Olympiad and commonly known as Tokyo 2020, is an international multi-sport event scheduled to take place from 23 July to 8 August 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. Originally due to take place between 24 July and 9 August 2020, the event was postponed in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite being rescheduled for 2021, the Games will retain the Tokyo 2020 name for marketing and branding purposes. This marks the first time that the Olympic Games have been postponed to a later date rather than cancelled altogether."
