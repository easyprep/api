  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "<strong>First statement is correct.</strong> Buddhism led by Gautama Buddha believed on the practice of eightfold path that is Right Understanding, Right Intent, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration. Jainism led by Mahavira focused on Five Great Vows (Maha-vratas)-Non-violence – Ahimsa; Truth – Satya; Non-stealing - Achaurya or Asteya; Celibacy/Chastity – Brahmacharya; Non-attachment/Non-possession – Aparigraha. <strong>Second statement is also correct.</strong> Buddha is believed to have meditated for 49 days and attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree (Ficus religiosa or Peepal tree). Vardhamana after 13 years of austere penance attained nirvana under a sal tree on the banks of river Rijupalika, and after this, he came to be known as Mahavira (great hero)."
