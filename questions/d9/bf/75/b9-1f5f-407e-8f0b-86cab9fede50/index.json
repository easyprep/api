  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe report on birth registration published by UNICEF noted that India has one of the highest number of unregistered births. There are 166 million children under the age of 5 years who are unregistered. Half of these children reside in 5 countries: India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Ethiopia and Congo.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nBirth certificate is a breeder document. This means that it is necessary for availing a host of other documents for legitimate identification, like drivers’ license. Without registration, the children become ‘invisible’ in the administrative system according to the report."
