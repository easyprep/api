  "question": "Despite 70 percent starch content, Sorghum is not popular as a good food. What could be the possible reason / reasons for this? <ol> <li>Sorghum starch consists of amylopectin, which is difficult to digest</li> <li>Sorghum contains tannins which make it poorly digestible</li> </ol> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "&nbsp; Sorghum is about 70 percent starch and a good energy source. Sorghum starch consists of 70 to 80 percent amylopectin, a branched-chain polymer of glucose, and 20 to 30 percent amylose, a straight-chain polymer. The digestibility of the sorghum starch is relatively poor in unprocessed form, varying between 33 to 48 percent. processing of the sorghum grain by methods such as steaming, pressure-cooking, flaking, puffing or micronization of the starch increases the digestibility of sorghum starch. This has been attributed to a release of starch granules from the protein matrix rendering them more susceptible to enzymatic digestion. On cooking, the gelatinized starch of sorghum tends to return from the soluble, dispersed and amorphous state to an insoluble crystalline state. This phenomenon is known as retrogradation; it is enhanced with low temperature and high concentration of starch. Amylose, the linear component of the starch, is more susceptible to retrogradation. Certain sorghum varieties contain anti-nutritional factors such as tannins. The presence of tannins is claimed to contribute to the poor digestibility of sorghum starch. Processing in humid thermal environment aids in lowering anti-nutritional factors of sorghum. Sorghum starch does not contain gluten. This makes sorghum a possible grain for those who are gluten sensitive."
