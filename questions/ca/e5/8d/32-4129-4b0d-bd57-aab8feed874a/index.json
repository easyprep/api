  "question": "A alone can complete a work in 12 days. A and B together can complete it in 8 days. How long will B alone take to complete the work?",
  "option1": "20 days",
  "option2": "24 days",
  "option3": "16 days",
  "option4": "18 days",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "24 days",
  "explanation": "A\\'s one day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{12}&s=1$\r\n(A + B)\\'s one day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{8}&s=1$\r\n∴ B\\'s one day\\'s work = \r\n$latex = \\\\frac{1}{8} - \\\\frac{1}{12} = \\\\frac{3-2}{24} = \\\\frac{1}{24}&s=1$\r\n∴ B alone can do the work in 24 days. \r\nHence option [B] is the right answer"
