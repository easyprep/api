It highlights the importance of sign language in the full realization of the human rights of people who are deaf.  It is the first ever IDSL, which was officially adopted at the 72nd United Nations General Assembly in December 2017. The 2018 theme \\\"With Sign Language, Everyone is Included!\\\" recognizes the importance of preserving sign languages as part of linguistic and cultural diversity. It also emphasizes the principle of “nothing about us without us” in terms of working with deaf communities."
