  "question": "In recent times, the term Cloud Seeding was making news frequently. Consider the following statements in this context: <ol> <li>Cloud seeding is a method of stimulating precipatation by use of chemicals such as lead iodide and potassium sulphate</li> <li>Cloud seeding increases precipitation and there is no guarantee of rainfall</li> </ol> Which of the above is/ are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "It is a method of stimulating precipitation by 'seeding' clouds with chemicals like silver iodide, dry ice or potassium iodide. This revolutionary technology has helped in dealing with drought hit situation completely. <br />Generally when clouds become heavy and gain more moisture it is difficult for it hold water and hence, rain occurs. The process of cloud seeding accelerate this by injecting more chemical nuclei in the clouds and creation of more clouds. But this process only increases precipitation and there is no guarantee of rainfall. Moreover, it being fairly in its development stage, the technique has become a subject of debate."
