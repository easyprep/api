  "question": "Water is a good solvent of ionic salts because of which of the following reasons?",
  "option1": "It has a high boiling point",
  "option2": "it has a high dipole moment",
  "option3": "it has a high specific heat",
  "option4": "it has no colour",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "it has a high dipole moment",
  "explanation": "Water is a strongly polar solvent with substantial charge separation operating in the individual molecule. And we could represent by the formulation δ+H−δ−O−δ+H and of course, this is the basis of hydrogen-bonding as an intermolecular force, and also for the ridiculously high normal boiling point of water as a small molecule.<br />The water dipole is capable of acting as a donor towards lewis-acidic metal centers and of course, most of the time, with inorganic salts, we got to spend a lot of time and trouble drying the salts, and removing water prior to reaction.<br />Water should be a good donor towards cations and indeed it is. It can offer some stabilization to anions and this all attempts to explain why water is such a prodigiously good solvent. Most substances, inorganic or organic, have some solubility in aqueous media. Ionic solutes can tend to have substantial solubilities."
