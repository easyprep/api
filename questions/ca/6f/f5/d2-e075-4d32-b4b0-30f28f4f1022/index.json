  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Urea is made by reacting carbon dioxide (CO2) with anhydrous ammonia (NH3) under high pressure and temperatures. CO2 can be sourced from Hydrocarbons. Thus, virtually, a Hydrocarbon can be a raw material for Urea. We note here that in January 2015, PTI had reported that central government is planning to set up soon a pilot project to produce urea from coal in Odisha."
