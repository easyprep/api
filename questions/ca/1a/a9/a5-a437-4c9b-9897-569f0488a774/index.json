  "question": "Who among the following are favoured by the Price rise?",
  "option1": "Debtors",
  "option2": "Pensioners",
  "option3": "Businessmen",
  "option4": "Government servants",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Debtors",
  "explanation": "When prices rise, the value of money falls. Though debtors return the same amount of money, but they pay less in terms of goods and services. This is because the value of money is less than when they borrowed the money. Thus the burden of the debt is reduced and debtors gain."
