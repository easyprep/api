  "explanation": "Second statement is incorrect because the scheme, introduced at the district level, provides for the co-ordination of the activities of the entire commercial and Co-operative Banks and other financial institutions operating in the district by one Bank, which is designated as the Lead Bank of that district. The Lead Bank Scheme (LBS) was applicable to all districts in the country except districts in metropolitan areas<strong>. </strong>Lead District Manager of the district is the Chairman of the Block Level Bankers&rsquo; Committee and District Collector as chairman for District Consultative Committee (DCC). Almost all the districts of the country have been allocated to the banks (public sector and to a few private sector) except the few districts. The Bank which has been assigned the lead responsibility is called Lead Bank of the district."
