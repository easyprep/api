  "option2": "1 and 3",
  "option3": "2 and 3",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe companies are required to allocate funds under Corporate Social Responsibility scheme annually. The amendment bill brings in tightening measures for the companies to follow this provision, in the form of disclosure rules. The companies are mandated to disclose the reasons for unspent amount from the CSR budget. The unspent amount will be transferred to funds that are listed under the act. Eg: PM’s relief fund\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nNational Financial Reporting Authority is empowered by the bill to debar not only chartered accountants, but also auditors of firms for a period of 6 months to 10 years. Such a measure is taken in case of misconduct. NFRA was formed under the Companies act, 2013. It was setup on the recommendations of Standing Committee on Finance for improving transparency.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe amendment shifts the power of ‘approving authority’ from NCLAT to the central government. The bill says that companies’ changing its period of financial year requires the centre’s approval, if it is associated with a foreign company. Incorporation documents’ alterations, which in effect changes a public to private firm, requires the centre’s permission according to the bill. The NCLAT or National Company Law Tribunal is a quasi-judicial body, formed under the 2013 act, on recommendation of Justice Eradi committee, in 2016."
