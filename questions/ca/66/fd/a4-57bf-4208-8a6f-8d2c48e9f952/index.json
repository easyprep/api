  "option1": "BrainROV TUNA",
  "option2": "HeadROV TUNA",
  "option3": "EyeROV TUNA",
  "option4": "HandROV TUNA",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "EyeROV TUNA",
  "explanation": "India’s first underwater robotic drone \\\"EyeROV TUNA\\\" was launched and handed over to Kochi-based DRDO lab \\\"Naval Physical and Oceanographic Laboratory (NPOL)\\\". The drone can send real-time videos of ships and other underwater structures to help with their repair and maintenance. It will be used by NPOL for research and development activities which in turn would result in a commercial product for defence purposes. The robotic drone can be navigated up to a depth of 50 meters to take real-time HD video images to examine ship hulls or undersea cables or bridge moorings and can eliminate the need for costlier and riskier manual inspection by divers. The first commercial Remotedly Operated Vehicle (ROV)/underwater drone \\\"EYEROVTUNA\\\" was developed by EyeROV Technologies, a company incubating at the Kalamassery-based Maker Village which is said to be the largest hardware incubator in the country."
