  "question": "A new term Anti-Green House Effect was in news recently. Consider the following statements: \r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Anti-Green House Effect causes cooling of the planet or body </li>\r\n<li>Anti-Green House Effect is not a phenomenon seen on earth </li>\r\n<li>Anti-Green House Effect is due to opacity of the planet / body’s atmosphere to Infra Red waves </li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3 are correct",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "Greenhouse effect occurs because the atmosphere transparent to solar radiation, but largely opaque to infrared and far infrared emitted by the planet / body. But in anti-greenhouse effect, the atmosphere is opaque to solar but lets out infrared. The effect is that the body is cooler than the actual temperature would have been. In case of Titan, both Green House Effect and Anti Green House Effect have been proved."
