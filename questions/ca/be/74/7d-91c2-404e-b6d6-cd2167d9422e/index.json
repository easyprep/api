  "answer": "Commonwealth Games",
  "explanation": "Commonwealth Game's traditional ceremony is \"Queen's Baton Relay\". The Commonwealth Games is an international multi-sport event involving athletes from the Commonwealth of Nations. The Queen's Baton Relay is a relay around the world held prior to the beginning of the Commonwealth Games. The Baton carries a message from the Head of the Commonwealth, currently Queen Elizabeth II. The Relay traditionally begins at Buckingham Palace in London as a part of the city's Commonwealth Day festivities. The Queen entrusts the baton to the first relay runner. At the Opening Ceremony of the Games, the final relay runner hands the baton back to the Queen or her representative, who reads the message aloud to officially open the Games. The Queen's Baton Relay is similar to the Olympic Torch Relay."
