  "question": "The unclaimed land area \"Bir Tawil\" is located between which two countries?",
  "option1": "Egypt and Sudan",
  "option2": "Egypt and Libya",
  "option3": "Ethiopia and Sudan",
  "option4": "Eritrea and Egypt",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Egypt and Sudan",
  "explanation": "The unclaimed land area \"Bir Tawil\" is located between Egypt and Sudan. This quadrilateral shaped land area is uninhabited and claimed by neither countries. Egypt asserts the political boundary, and Sudan asserts the administrative boundary, with the result that the Hala'ib Triangle is claimed by both and Bir Tawil by neither. In 2014, author Alastair Bonnett described Bir Tawil as the only place on Earth that was habitable but was not claimed by any recognised government. There is no basis in international law for either Sudan or Egypt to claim both territories, and neither nation is willing to cede Hala'ib. With no third state claiming the neglected area, Bir Tawil is one of the few land areas of the world not claimed by any recognised state. Egypt arguably still administers the territory, but it is not marked as Egyptian on government maps."
