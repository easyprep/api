Apart from this, the application is being seen as an instrument to track voter sentiment across various constituencies in India.   The purpose of app is to foster political accountability by being an indicator of the ways in which a leaderâ€™s performance is being perceived. To ensure participation, the app requires a combination of mediums like the app itself, IVR calls, SMS and even offline activation leveraging ASHA and anganwadi workers to collate data on evolving political inclinations. The app is the brainchild of an entrepreneur Pratham Mittal  and is inspired by the US approval system."
