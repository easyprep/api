  "question": "The UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Valley of the Gates of the Kings\" archaeological site is located in which country?",
  "option1": "Iran",
  "option2": "Iraq",
  "option3": "Lebanon",
  "option4": "Egypt",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Egypt",
  "explanation": "The ancient Egyptians built massive public monuments to their pharaohs. But they also spent time and treasure creating hidden underground mausoleums. The most famed collection of such elaborate tombs—the Valley of the Kings, also known as Valley of the Gates of the Kings—lies on the Nile's west bank near Luxor, Egypt. The Pyramids of Giza and the Nile Delta were the tombs of choice for pharaohs of Egypt's the Old Kingdom. But New Kingdom pharaohs, who wanted to be closer to the source of their dynastic roots in the south, built their crypts in the hills of this barren tract west of Luxor, now called the Valley of the Kings."
