  "answer": "50 per cent",
  "explanation": "The government has recently modified public procurement norms to give maximum preference to companies whose goods and services have 50 per cent or more local content.\r\nThe revised Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order 2017, has introduced a concept of Class-I, II and non-local suppliers. Class I supplier has local content equal to or more than 50 % local content. Only Class-I local supplier, shall be eligible to bid irrespective of purchase value and hence be given maximum preference in all government purchases."
