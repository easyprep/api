  "question": "Consider the following statements about the X-Rays:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The Hard X-Rays have a shorter wavelength than the Soft X-Rays</li>\r\n<li>The X-Rays are deflected by the Electric Field, but are not deflected by the Magnetic Field</li>\r\n<li>X-Rays donâ€™t show many properties of light such as Refraction, diffraction, Interference and Polarization</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3 are correct",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "X-rays are types of electromagnetic radiation probably most well-known for their ability to see through a person's skin and reveal images of the bones beneath it. The Hard X-Rays have a shorter wavelength than the Soft X-Rays. X-rays can be described as coupled waves of electric and magnetic fields traveling at the speed of light (about 300,000 km, or 186,000 miles, per second)."
