  "option1": "amortisation of debt of the Union Government",
  "option2": "amortisation of debt of the State governments",
  "option3": "Financing the public sector banks affected by bad debts",
  "option4": "amortisation of debt of the Union and State governments",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "amortisation of debt of the Union and State governments",
  "explanation": "The proposal to establish such fund had first come from 10th Finance Commission, which said that such funds should be established as a part of fiscal discipline and that the constitution of Consolidated Sinking Fund (CSF) for the amortisation of debt was <em><u>relevant both for States and the Union</u></em>. The logic of constituting a CSF for States was to enable them to tide over the roll-over risks due to their weak cash management practices and also State Development Loans being under-subscribed. 14th Finance Commission has reiterated this proposal."
