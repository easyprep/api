  "question": "The scientists at which US University have found that cold plasma can kill 99.9% of airborne viruses?",
  "option1": "Clemson University",
  "option2": "University of Michigan",
  "option3": "Stanford University",
  "option4": "Yale University",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "University of Michigan",
  "explanation": "Scientists from University of Michigan in the United States have found that dangerous airborne viruses can be rendered harmless on-the-fly when exposed to \\'cold plasma\\' - a stream of energetic, charged fragments of air molecules. The researchers have measured the virus-killing speed and effectiveness of non thermal plasmas - the ionised, or charged, particles that form around electrical discharges such as sparks. A non thermal plasma reactor was able to inactivate or remove from the air stream 99.9% of a test virus. The researchers hope to one day harness this capability to replace the surgical mask."
