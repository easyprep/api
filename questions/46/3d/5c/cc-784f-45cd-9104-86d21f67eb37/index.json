  "question": "<p>Seaweeds are an important source of which of the following?</p>",
  "option1": "Iron",
  "option2": "Chlorine",
  "option3": "Bromine",
  "option4": "Iodine",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Iodine",
  "explanation": "<p>Edible seaweed products have been consumed in many Asian countries. Edible seaweeds accumulate iodine from seawater and are therefore a good dietary source of iodine. Adequate consumption of seaweed can eliminate iodine deficiency disorders, but excessive iodine intake is not good for health. The recommended dietary reference intake of 0.15 mg/d and 0.14 mg/d for iodine has been established in the United States and Taiwan, respectively. Seaweed is an excellent source of iodine. However, the amount it contains depends on the species. Kombu kelp offers the highest amount of iodine, with some varieties containing nearly 2,000% of the daily value in one gram. Seaweed is a source of iodine, necessary for thyroid function and to prevent goitre. However, an excess of iodine is suspected in the heightened cancer risk in Japanese who consume a lot of the plant, and even bigger risks in post-menopausal women.</p>"
