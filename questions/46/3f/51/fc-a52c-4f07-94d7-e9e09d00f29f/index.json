  "answer": "Okhla Barrage in Delhi",
  "explanation": "&#8220;Upper Yamuna&#8221; refers to the reach of Yamuna from its origin at Yamunotri to Okhla Barrage in Delhi. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed on 12th May, 1994 amongst the basin states of Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi, for sharing the utilizable surface flows of river Yamuna up to Okhla. The MoU also provided for creation of &#8220;Upper Yamuna River Board&#8221; to implement the said agreement. Accordingly, the Central Government constituted the Upper Yamuna River Board in 1995 as a subordinate office under the Ministry of Water Resources. After the creation of Uttaranchal State in 2000, the resolution was modified to include Uttaranchal (now Uttarakhand) also in the Board. The resolution also provided for constitution of a Review Committee, to be known as the Upper Yamuna Review Committee (UYRC), comprising the Chief Ministers (Governor in case of Presidentâ€™s rule) of the co-basin states as members and Union Minister/Minister of State for Water Resources as Chairman, to supervise the working of the Upper Yamuna River Board (UYRB)."
