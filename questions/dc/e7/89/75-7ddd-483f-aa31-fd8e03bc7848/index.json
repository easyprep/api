  "option1": "Absolute Humidity",
  "option2": "Relative Humidity",
  "option3": "Condensation",
  "option4": "Specific Humidity",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Absolute Humidity",
  "explanation": "Humidity is the amount of water vapour present in air.Â <br />Absolute Humidity is the weight of actual amount of water vapour present in unit volume of air.<br />Relative Humidity is the Ratio of water vapour in air at a particular temp. to total amount of water vapour required to saturate the same air at same temperature. It is expressed in %<br />Specific Humidity is the Weight of water vapour present in per unit weight of air. It is not affected by change in pressure or temperature."
