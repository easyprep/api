  "question": "The least multiple of 13, which on dividing by 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 leaves remainder 2 in each case is :",
  "option1": 840,
  "option2": 842,
  "option3": 2520,
  "option4": 2522,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 2522,
  "explanation": "LCM of 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 = 840.\r\nLet require number be 840 K + 2 which is multiple of 13.\r\nLeast value of K for which (840 K + 2) is divisible by 13 is K = 3\r\nâˆ´ Require Number = 840 $latex \\\\times$ 3 + 2 = 2520 + 2 = 2522.\r\nHence option [D] is correct answer."
