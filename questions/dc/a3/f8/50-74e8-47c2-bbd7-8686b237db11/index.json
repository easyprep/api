It estimated an inflow of 4.45 billion USD in April to September 2019 period for service sector alone. Computer software, hardware, telecommunication, automobile and trading sectors are the other top FDI attracters.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe term FDI is used to refer to an investment made by a foreign investor in a business located in another country.
