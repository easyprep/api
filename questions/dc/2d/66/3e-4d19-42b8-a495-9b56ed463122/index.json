  "question": "In context with the discovery of the Polka Dot Tree Frog, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is the first naturally fluorescent frog to be discovered.</li>\n<li>This frog species exhibits bioluminescence.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Polka Dot Frog is the first naturally fluorescent frog to be discovered by scientists. It was discovered in South America (in Argentina). Fluorescence is the re-emission of light at a longer wavelength. This is a rare phenomenon in terrestrial organisms.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nFluorescence is not the same as bioluminescence. The frog showed fluorescence due to presence of certain chemical compounds: hyloin L1, hyloin L2 and hyloin G1. Bioluminescence is due to light emitted by light producing bacteria housed in certain parts of an animalâ€™s body."
