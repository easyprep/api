  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Gujarat",
  "explanation": "ONGC has successfully drilled the country's first shale gas exploratory well near Jambusar about 60 km from Vadodara and has decided to drill more wells in Cambay region of Gujarat. The estimated shale gas potential of the well is about 20 TCF. Shale gas is natural gas trapped within the non porous layers of shale rock and can be utilised as cooking gas and for other commercial purposes. ONGC estimates India's shale gas reserve in the range of 500 to 2000 trillion cubic meters. A part from the Cambay basin, the ONGC will also explore Krishna-Godavari, Cauvery and Vindhyan sedimentary basins for shale gas."
