  "question": "Coriolis force is:<br> 1. an apparent force caused by the earth&#8217;s rotation and revolution<br> 2. responsible for deflection of winds towards the right in the northern hemisphere and left in the southern hemisphere<br> 3. responsible for deflection of the south-east trade winds which enter the Indian peninsula as the south-west monsoon<br> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
