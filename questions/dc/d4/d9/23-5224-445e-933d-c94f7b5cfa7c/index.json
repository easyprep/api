  "question": "Which of the following depositional features are correctly matched with their type of landforms?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Moraines - Glacial deposits</li>\r\n<li>Barchans - Aeolian deposits</li>\r\n<li>Delta - Fluvial deposits</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "1 and 2",
  "option3": "1 and 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 and 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong>Moraines - Glacial deposits</strong>\r\nA moraine is material left behind by a moving glacier. This material is usually soil and rock. Just as rivers carry along all sorts of debris and silt that eventually builds up to form deltas, glaciers transport all sorts of dirt and boulders that build up to form moraines.\r\n<strong>Barchans - Aeolian deposits</strong>\r\nBarchans are crescent shaped dunes formed due to Aeolian deposits.\r\n<strong>Delta - Fluvial deposits</strong>\r\nDelta is formed via fluvial deposits."
