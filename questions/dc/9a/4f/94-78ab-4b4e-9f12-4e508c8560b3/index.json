  "question": "Why Antarctica is colder than Arctic during their respective winters?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Interior areas of Antarctica don’t get benefit from the moderating influence of water</li>\r\n<li>During the winter, the size of Antarctica doubles and ice is blocking heat from the warmer surrounding ocean water</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<p class=\\\"Explanation\\\">Antarctica is synonymous with cold, thanks to its polar location, its high elevation, its lack of a protective, water-vapor filled atmosphere, and its permanent ice cover which reflects about 80% of the sun’s radiation back into space. The South Pole is located within a permanent polar high created by the normal Hadley Circulation. This creates an extremely cold air mass which descends at the poles of the Earth. Unlike the Arctic region, Antarctica is a continent surrounded by an ocean which means that interior areas do not benefit from the moderating influence of water. During the winter, the size of Antarctica doubles as the surrounding sea water freezes blocking heat from the warmer surrounding ocean water."
