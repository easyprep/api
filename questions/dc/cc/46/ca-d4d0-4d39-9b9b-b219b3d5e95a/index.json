  "answer": "2 Only",
  "explanation": "The President exercises Suspensive Veto when he returns a bill for reconsideration of the Parliament. The President has no Suspensive veto in case of Money bill. Similarly, President cannot send a Constitutional Amendment bill for reconsideration of the Parliament. Thus, Suspensive Veto is exercised by the President only in case of Ordinary bills passed by the Parliament."
