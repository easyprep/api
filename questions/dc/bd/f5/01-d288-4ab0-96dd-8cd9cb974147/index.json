  "explanation": "Karst topography is a result of the dissolution of soluble rocks like limestone, dolomite and gypsum. <br />Caves are formed due to <strong>weathering</strong> of rock deep underground. Cave or cavern is a natural void and is a space large enough so that a human can enter. The study of the formation and development of caves is called as Speleogenesis. Most caves are formed in limestone by dissolution."
