  "explanation": "The \"Decorated Cave of Pont d’Arc, known as Grotte Chauvet-Pont d’Arc, Ardeche\", summed up as Chauvet Cave, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site of France. The decorated cave of Pont d’Arc, known as Grotte Chauvet-Pont d’Arc is located in a limestone plateau of the meandering Ardeche River in southern France and extends to an area of approximately 8,500 square meters. It contains the earliest known pictorial drawings, carbon-dated to as early as the Aurignacian period (30,000 to 32,000 BP). The cave was closed off by a rockfall approximately 20,000 years BP and remained sealed until its rediscovery in 1994. It contains more than 1,000 drawings, predominantly of animals, including several dangerous species, as well as a large number of archaeological and Palaeolithic vestiges."
