  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",

The MUDRA scheme provides refinance for three types of loans given by lending institutions &ndash; Shiatsu loans are up to Rs 50,000, Kishor loans are between Rs 50,001 and Rs 5 lakh and Tarun loans of Rs 5-10 lakhs."
