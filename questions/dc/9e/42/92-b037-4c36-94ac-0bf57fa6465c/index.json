  "question": "What was \"Edward Teller\" famous for?",
  "option1": "As a Hungarian-American theoretical physicist",
  "option2": "As a Hungarian-American biologist",
  "option3": "As a Hungarian-American software engineer",
  "option4": "As a Hungarian-American mathematician",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "As a Hungarian-American theoretical physicist",
  "explanation": "Edward Teller was a Hungarian-American theoretical physicist who is known colloquially as \"the father of the hydrogen bomb\" (see the Teller–Ulam design). He made numerous contributions to nuclear and molecular physics, spectroscopy (in particular the Jahn–Teller and Renner–Teller effects), and surface physics. His extension of Enrico Fermi's theory of beta decay, in the form of Gamow–Teller transitions, provided an important stepping stone in its application, while the Jahn–Teller effect and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) theory have retained their original formulation and are still mainstays in physics and chemistry.",
