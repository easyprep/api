  "question": "What will be the change in the height of water in a capillary tube in stationary condition on earth if the same tube is taken in a lift going downward with acceleration?",
  "option1": "height increases",
  "option2": "height decreases",
  "option3": "Remains same",
  "option4": "can decrease or increase",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "height increases",
  "explanation": "In a lift going downward with acceleration, the effective acceleration decreases. So height increases as height is inversely proportional to the acceleration due to gravity."
