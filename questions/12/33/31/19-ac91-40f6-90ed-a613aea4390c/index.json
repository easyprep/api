  "question": "Who is going to direct historical drama ‘King Leopold’s Ghost’?",
  "option1": "Ridley Scott",
  "option2": "Ben Affleck",
  "option3": "Farhad Safinia",
  "option4": "Adam Hochschild",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Ben Affleck",
  "explanation": "Ben Affleck has set King Leopold’s Ghost, a true story of rebellion against genocide in the Congo in the late 1800s, as his next directorial project. The film is based on Adam Hochschild book King Leopold’s Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror and Heroism in Colonial Africa that chronicles an atrocious piece of history that is every bit as bad as the subtitle infers. Veteran filmmaker Martin Scorsese will produce the film alongside Affleck."
