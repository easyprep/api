  "question": "In context of India recording the highest number of childbirths on New Year’s Day, consider the following statements about the Every Child Alive campaign:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It was launched by WHO.</li>\r\n<li>Most of the  under 5 years’ deaths among children occur in the first month.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe Every Child Alive campaign was launched by UNICEF. Through this campaign, the international organisation urges government to make investment in improving health infrastructure to reduce child mortality, especially in the early stages of life. It recently highlighted a lack of trained personnel as a major cause of child death.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe UNICEF recently highlighted that nearly half (47%) of the death of children under 5 years occurred during the first month of life. The trend has changed since 1990 when this accounted for a lower 40%. UNICEF also noted that most of the childbirths on New Year’s Day occurred in India (67,385 births)."
