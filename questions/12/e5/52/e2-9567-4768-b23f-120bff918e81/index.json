  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about Ocean Currents?<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The difference in heating and surface temperatures play a key role in movements of ocean water.</li>\r\n<li>Due to Coriolis force, the movement of ocean currents in the northern hemisphere is in the clockwise and in the southern hemisphere it is in the anti-clockwise direction.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The differential heating of the Sun at the equator and the poles causes a difference in the temperature of ocean water.<br />Hence, the difference in heating and surface temperatures play a key role in movements of ocean water.<br />Under the action of Coriolis force, the movement of ocean currents in the northern hemisphere is in the clockwise and in the southern hemisphere it is in the anti-clockwise direction. Hence it can be said that ocean currents obey Ferrel's law."
