  "question": "What role does fibers play in Optical Fiber cables?",
  "option1": "Prevent loss of signals",
  "option2": "Provide immunity against electromagnetic interference",
  "option3": "Both a and b",
  "option4": "None",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both a and b",
  "explanation": "Fibers are used instead of metal wires because signals travel along them with less loss. Also, fibers are immune to electromagnetic interference, a problem from which metal wires suffer excessively. In addition, Fibers are also used for illumination and imaging."
