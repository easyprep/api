  "answer": "1 & 3 Only",
  "explanation": "The doctrine of subsidiary alliance was introduced by Lord Wellesley. Lord Cornwallis introduced a new revenue system under the Permanent Settlement of Bengal in 1793 with a view to stabilize land revenue and create a loyal contented class of Zamindars. This abolished periodic auction of Zamindari rights and established permanent Zamindari rights to collect land revenue from the tenants and payment of a fixed amount to the Government treasury every year. During his tenure, doors of covenanted services were closed for Indians. He got the power of commutation of punishment. He defeated Tipu in third Anglo-Mysore war and signed Treaty of Srirangpatanam."
