  "question": "Nuclear power poses environmental risks due to the hazards associated with nuclear waste and power plant accidents. Still nuclear power is advocated by some because__:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The cost of building nuclear power plants is low</li>\r\n<li>The long-term underground storage of nuclear waste is simple and viable</li>\r\n<li>Carbon emissions from nuclear power plants is low</li>\r\n<li>There is no GHG emission from Nuclear Power plants</li>\r\n<li>Nuclear fuel can be reprocessed</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option2": "2, 3, 4 & 5",
  "option3": "2, 3 & 5",
  "option4": "3 & 5",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "3 & 5",
  "explanation": "Despite the risk of accidents and costs associated with nuclear waste, there are two positives to the use of nuclear power. One is that nuclear plants release <u>few carbon emissions</u> (not nil) as well as few GHG (not nil) into the atmosphere, and therefore have limited impact on global warming. The second is that nuclear fuel can be reprocessed and is thus considered a renewable, long-lasting energy. The problem with reprocessing fuel is that it often creates weapons-grade plutonium, which can present a security risk. Nuclear power plants are extremely expensive to build. Underground storage as a possibility for nuclear waste has yet to be proven viable either from an engineering or policy standpoint"
