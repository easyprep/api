  "explanation": "The question may be reframed as which of the following countries is known as Land of Midnight Sun with keeping Norway in one of the options. Norway falls in Arctic circle. The high latitude leads to large seasonal variations in daylight. From late May to late July, the sun never completely descends beneath the horizon in areas north of the Arctic Circle and that is why it is known as Land of Midnight Sun. the phenomena is seen in Arctic as well as Antarctic circles. Sun is visible for a continuous 24 hours, mostly north of the Arctic Circle and south of the Antarctic Circle."
