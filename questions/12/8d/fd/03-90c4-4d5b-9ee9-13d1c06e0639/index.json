  "answer": "Undertaking of earthworks, soil conservation measures and tree plantation, so as to conserve soil moisture and recharge underground water",
  "explanation": "The agriculture in low rainfall areas of eastern Rajasthan is characterized by high risks from drought, degraded natural resources and pervasive poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition. In this region, water is the main limiting fac-tor for upgrading rainfed agriculture. <br />For such areas integrated watershed management is recognized as a potential approach for agriculture growth and rehabilitation of fragile and degraded lands. Undertaking of earthworks, soil conservation measures and tree plantation, so as to conserve soil moisture and recharge underground water are the objectives of watershed development in the semi-arid regions of India."
