  "question": "Which International organisation has announced that Qatar will officially abolish its controversial exit visa system for all foreign workers by the end of 2019?",
  "option1": "ILO",
  "option2": "UNIDO",
  "option3": "UNESCO",
  "option4": "WHO",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "ILO",
  "explanation": "The International Labour Organization (ILO) has recently announced that Qatar will officially abolish its controversial exit visa system for all foreign workers by the end of 2019. It must be noted that Qatar has introduced a series of labour reforms since its selection as the 2022 World Cup host, with the event setting in motion a huge construction programme employing foreign workers. In September 2018, Qatar approved legislation to scrap the \\\"kafala\\\", or sponsorship, system which required that foreign workers obtain permission from their employers to leave the country. In February 2019, Qatar said it was committed to labour reform following an Amnesty International report that the 2022 World Cup host was failing to stop widespread labour abuse. As part of its pledge to reform the labour section, Qatar has also introduced a monthly minimum wage of 750 riyals ($206) and agreed to work closely with the ILO, which now has an office in the capital."
