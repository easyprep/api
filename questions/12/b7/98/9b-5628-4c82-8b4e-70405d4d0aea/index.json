  "question": "Which of the following can lead to reduction in friction?",
  "option1": "rolling to sliding",
  "option2": "potential energy to kinetic energy",
  "option3": "dynamic to static",
  "option4": "sliding to rolling",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "sliding to rolling",
  "explanation": "No force is transferred or modified by a rotating wheel. A wheel reduces friction by allowing the contacting surfaces to roll rather than to drag or slide over each other. By reducing friction, a wheel can enable you to use less force to move an object."
