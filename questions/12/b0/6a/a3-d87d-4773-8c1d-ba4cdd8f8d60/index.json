  "option1": "Syria",
  "option2": "Israel",
  "option3": "Iran",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Syria",
  "explanation": "Golan Heights, also called Golan Plateau is a part of hilly area overlooking the upper Jordan River valley on the west. The area was part of extreme southwestern Syria until 1967, when it came under Israeli military occupation, and in December 1981 Israel unilaterally annexed the part of the Golan it held. The areaâ€™s name is from the biblical city of refuge Golan in Bashan.<br />In 2000, Israel and Syria held their highest-level talks over a possible return of the Golan and a peace agreement. But the negotiations collapsed and subsequent talks also failed. <br />More than 40,000 people live on the Israeli-occupied Golan, more than half of them Druze residents. The Druze are an Arab minority who practice an offshoot of Islam and many of its adherents in Syria have long been loyal to the Assad regime."
