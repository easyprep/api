  "explanation": "In 1916, the Punjab CID had unearthed a plan by Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi and Mahmud al Hasan (Darul Uloom Deoband), which was aimed for a general Muslim uprising against the British. It was known as Silk Letter Conspiracy or Tahreek a Reshami Rumal.<br />Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi and Mahmud al Hasan (principal of the Darul Uloom Deoband) had proceeded to Kabul in October 1915 with plans to initiate a Muslim insurrection in the tribal belt of India. The messages written on silk handkerchiefs fell into the hands of the British and thus it was named Silk Letter Conspiracy. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad was also involved in it. The other two statements are also correct."
