  "explanation": "Rig-Veda is a collection of samhita, and mandala of 1028 hymns composed in Vedic Sanskrit. These hymns are dedicated to various deities. The Sama Veda is a book of songs (saman) based on Rig-Veda. There are two versions of Yajur Veda, Krishna Yajurveda and Shukla Yajurveda. Yajurveda is a collection of short prose used in rituals. The Atharvaveda has less connection with sacrifice and deals with normal procedures for everyday life. Atharvaveda is also known as &ldquo;Veda of magical formulas&rdquo;."
