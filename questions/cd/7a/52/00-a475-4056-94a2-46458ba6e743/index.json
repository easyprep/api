  "answer": "Nepal",
  "explanation": "The Government of Nepal has launched an ambitious 45-day \\'Everest Cleaning Campaign\\' to bring back tonnes of trash from Mt. Everest from 14th April 2019. The campaign is led by Solukhumbu district’s Khumbu Pasanglhamu Rural Municipality and aims to collect nearly 10,000 kgs of garbage from Mt. Everest. Every year, hundreds of climbers, Sherpas and high altitude porters make their way to Everest, leaving behind tonnes of both biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste - including empty oxygen canisters, kitchen waste, beer bottles and faecal matter - on the highest peak, which has lately acquired notoriety as the \\\"world\\'s highest garbage dump\\\". The campaign will conclude on May 29, the day marked every year to commemorate the first summit of Everest by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953. The collected waste will then be showcased in Namche town, before being ferried down to Kathmandu, where it will once again be showcased on World Environment Day (WED-2019) on June 5. After that, it will finally be sent out for recycling."
