  "question": "Trans Fatty Acids (TFAs) are used in food items because__:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>They increase the shelf life of products</li>\r\n<li>They stabilize the flavour and texture of food</li>\r\n<li>They raise the HDL and lower the LDL</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Naturally occurring trans fatty acids, or TFAs, are present in minimal quantity in meat and dairy products from ruminants. Most of the TFAs are created artificially during the process of partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils. TFAs increase the shelf life of products, improve the texture of food and stabilize the flavor. These features have resulted in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils to be used excessively in our food industry in baked foods, like cakes, burgers and biscuit raising the level of LDL, but, unlike saturated fat, it has the additional effect of decreasing levels of HDL."
