  "answer": "1, 2 & 3 Only",
  "explanation": "Fourth statement is incorrect because the use of iron implements had no place in chalcolithic culture. The&nbsp;people used copper to make tools and weapons. The supply of copper was limited and people didn&rsquo;t know the use of bronze. Most of the Chalcolithic people domesticated cattle and lived in central and western India and did not practise cultivation on large scale."
