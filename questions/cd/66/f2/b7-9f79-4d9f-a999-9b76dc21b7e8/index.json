At present, two projects — Simang I and II totalling 133 MW — are located on the Simang, the right bank tributary of the river Siang. However, the Siang valley alone has an estimated 12,450 MW of hydel potential, which, in the north-east as a whole, is well in excess of 50,000 MW, much of it in Arunachal Pradesh. Overall, a projected 90,000 MW of pumped storage hydel capacity is yet to be tapped. In this question, all the statements are in.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table><ph^>"
