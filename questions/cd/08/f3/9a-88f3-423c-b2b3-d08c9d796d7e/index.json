  "option1": "Teak",
  "option2": "Eucalyptus",
  "option3": "Banyan",
  "option4": "Coconut",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Eucalyptus",
  "explanation": "Eucalyptus is the fast growing tree. Most eucalyptus species have a root depth of 1.5-2.0 metre and its root system is more specifically adapted to using rain-fed soil moisture from the upper soil profile, rather than from the groundwater table at considerable depth.Â The plant is significant for wood availability, livelihood generation and carbon sequestration that address the challenges of global warming and climate change."
