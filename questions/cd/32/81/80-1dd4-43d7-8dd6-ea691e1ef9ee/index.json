  "question": "With reference to the government offering blocks for bidding under the Open Acreage Licensing Policy-IV (OALP), consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) replaced the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP).</li>\r\n<li>OALP allows companies to select exploration blocks on their own.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe HELP was introduced in 2016 to replace the erstwhile NELP. Under HELP, the government had introduced the OALP and the National Data Repository. It enables faster exploration of the countryâ€™s oil and gas reserves. India has 26 sedimentary basins and in 2012-13, nearly 48% of it remained unapprised.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nOALP is different from its predecessor because potential investors need not wait for bidding rounds. NELP used cyclic bidding rounds to decide on acreage claims. In OALP, the acreage will be available throughout the year. The companies can select exploration blocks on their own by applying to the government."
