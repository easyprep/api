  "answer": "Trans fats are produced artificially because they are not found in nature",
  "explanation": "The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has launched a new campaign in order to create awareness about trans-fats and eliminate them in India by 2022.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Trans-fatty acids (TFAs) are the most harmful type of fats which can have adverse effects on our body.</li>\r\n<li>These fats are largely produced artificially but a small amount also occurs naturally.</li>\r\n<li>The natural TFAs are present in meats and dairy products, though in small amounts.</li>\r\n<li>Artificial TFAs are formed when hydrogen is made to react with the oil to produce fats resembling pure ghee/butter.</li>\r\n<li>Major sources of artificial TFAs are the partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (PHVO).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nTFAs pose a higher risk of heart disease than saturated fats. TFAs not only raise total cholesterol levels but also reduce the good cholesterol (HDL), which helps to protect us against heart disease. It is also associated with a higher risk of developing obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, infertility and certain types of cancers."
