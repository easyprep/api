  "explanation": "King George VI Falls, also known as Salto Oshi or Oshi Falls, is located on the Oshi River in Guyana. This waterfall is rarely visited. Its height has not been reliably determined but is believed to be between about 500 and 700 feet. Though it is not as tall as it has long been thought to be, it is notable for its combination of height and a great volume of water, along with its being a sheer plunge.",
