  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Australia and Timor-Leste",
  "explanation": "<p>The Sunrise International Unitization Agreement is officially known as the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste relating to the Unitisation of the Sunrise and Troubadour Fields. <sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"></sup>The Sunrise International Unitisation Agreement was made to enable the exploitation of the Sunrise and Troubador petroleum and gas fields in the Timor Sea, together known as the Greater Sunrise field. The Greater Sunrise field straddles the border between the joint petroleum development area established under the Timor Sea Treaty and Australian territorial waters as determined by the 1972 seabed boundary agreement between Australia and Indonesia. Unitisation of the field would enable it to be treated as one as far as exploitation, regulation, revenue taxation, management and other purposes are concerned, giving certainty to investors by providing a financial framework and international legal basis for the development of the field.</p>"
