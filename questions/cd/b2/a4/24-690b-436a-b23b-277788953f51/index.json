  "answer": "Kidney trouble",
  "explanation": "Dialysis is a treatment that is needed when our own kidneys can no longer take care of body\\'s needs. Dialysis allows people withÂ kidney failure a chance to live. When kidney function decreases to a critical level or complications arise, a person may need to start dialysis. Dialysis keeps your body in balance by:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Removing waste, salt and extra water to prevent them from building up in the body</li>\r\n<li>Keeping a safe level of certain chemicals in your blood, such as potassium, sodium and bicarbonate</li>\r\n<li>Helping to control blood pressure</li>\r\n</ul>"
