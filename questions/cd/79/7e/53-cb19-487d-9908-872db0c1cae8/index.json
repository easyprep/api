  "question": "In context with the Supreme Court’s ruling on AGR or Adjusted Gross Revenue with respect to the telecom sector, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>AGR is paid by Telecom Company to the government.</li>\n<li>The AGR is calculated only based on revenues from telecom sources.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nAGR or Aggregate Gross Revenue is paid by the telecom companies to the government. It is the license fee and spectrum charge paid by the companies to the central government in the form of revenue share. It has been a source of contention between the government and the industry.  \n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe SC in October ruled in favour of the government’s definition of AGR. This means that the AGR will include the companies’ income from both telecom and non-telecom sources. Non-telecom sources of revenue to the telecom companies include asset sale and deposit interest."
