  "question": "Due to which of the following phenomena, we see the rainbow colors in a compact disc (CD) while holding it in Sun Light? <ol><li>Reflection</li><li>Interference</li><li>Diffraction</li></ol> Select the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "One side of each CD is having the data written on it in binary form. Then there is a coating of metals such as Aluminum, followed by coating of a clear plastic. The data is read by laser. The data is in the form of pits arranged in some spirals , whose turns are closely wound and CD works as a reflection grating. It is very common to see rainbow patterns when you look at the surface of a CD, and also when you look at soap bubbles or a thin film of oil floating on still water. All three of these effects are created by constructive and destructive interference of the light hitting the film. The two more phenomena that work in the process are Reflection and Diffraction."
