  "question": "The Oxides of Nitrogen are major reason behind which of the following?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Ground level Ozone</li>\r\n<li>Ozone Hole</li>\r\n<li>Acid Rain</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Ground level ozone is created by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen (Nox) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the presence of sunlight. <br /><strong>Nitrous oxide</strong> has now become the largest <strong>ozone</strong>–<strong>depleting</strong> substance emitted through human activities, and is expected to remain the largest. The three kinds of Oxides matter in the Acid Rains. They are <em><u>Oxides of Sulphur,</u></em> <em><u>Oxides of Nitrogen</u></em> and <em><u>Oxides of Hydrogen</u></em> viz. water and Hydroxyl Radicals."
