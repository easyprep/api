  "explanation": "According to an analysis published in Carbon Brief, India’s Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions growth is expected to slow down by 2% in 2019. The emissions are lower than the annual increase seen in any year since 2001 due to a slower growth in coal-based power generation and rise in renewable power generation.  The Oil demand growth slowed to 2.6% in the first eight months of 2019, compared with 4.6% in 2018, and 5% on average over the past 10 years. Carbon Brief is a site that tracks emission and CO2 trends."
