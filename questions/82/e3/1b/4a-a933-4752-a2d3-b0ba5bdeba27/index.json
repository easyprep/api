  "question": "Northern Cyprus has been in the news due to the mass arrests by the Turkish government. In this context, consider the following statements about Northern Cyprus:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is an internationally recognised breakaway state from the Republic of Cyprus.</li>\n<li>It is located in the Black Sea.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Northern Cypress is a breakaway state of Republic of Cyprus. However, it is recognised only by Turkey. Due to lack of international recognition, it is highly dependent on the Turkish economy. Turkey maintains a large armed force in the island.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe island is located in the Mediterranean Sea. Northern Cypress spreads across one-third of the island. Turkey is to its north and Syria to its east. Currently, the region is under an EU-imposed UN-supported embargo. The de facto state has been under such embargoes since 1983.\n&nbsp;"
