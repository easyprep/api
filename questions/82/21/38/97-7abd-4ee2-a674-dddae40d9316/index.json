It was brokered by the Algerian government to resolve the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. During the hostage situation, 52 Americans were taken hostage by Iran. This was referred to by the US president along with threats of attack on 52 Iranian sites.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe 1981 Algiers Accord called for the withdrawal of the asset freeze imposed by the US government on Iran during the hostage crisis.
