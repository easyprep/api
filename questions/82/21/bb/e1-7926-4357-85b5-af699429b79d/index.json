  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe Chinese paddlefish was recently reported to have gone extinct functionally. It is thought that there are no more viable breeding pairs of this freshwater species. It is one of the largest freshwater fishes of the Yangtze River. It is also known as the Chinese swordfish.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe large freshwater fish was mainly wiped out by overfishing and pollution apart from dam building activity on the Yangtze River. In the beginning of January, the Chinese government had imposed a ban on commercial fishing on the Yangtze River. The fish is also called the ‘Panda of the Yangtze River’."
