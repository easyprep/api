  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "The Van Alien radiation belt is a torus of energetic charged particles (plasma) around Earth, which is held in place by Earth&#8217;s magnetic field. It is believed that most of the particles that form the belts come from solar wind, and other particles by cosmic rays. ts discoverer, James Van Alien, and is located in the inner region of the Earth&#8217;s Magnetosphere. It is split into two distinct belts, with energetic electrons forming the outer belt and a combination of protons and electrons forming the inner belts. In addition, the radiation belts contain lesser amounts of other nuclei, such as alpha particles. The belts pose a hazard to satellites, which must protect their sensitive components with adequate shielding if their orbit spends significant time in the radiation belts.<br> As far as protective effects of Van Allen Belts are concerned, they have not much to credit for. Van Allen belts protect against charged particle radiation but at the same time don&#8217;t not protect against electromagnetic radiation. This protection is done by the atmosphere (Inosphere). Thus, the statement that these belts protect earth is true in terms of particle radiation, false in terms of EM radiation. Van Allen Belts are regions of high concentrations of particle radiation. It is the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field that does the protecting, forming the belts in the process."
