  "question": "With reference to the announcement of the loan melas in 400 districts, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The loans will be lent for MSMEs alone.</li>\n<li>The public sector banks are not to declare stressed MSME loan as NPA until 2020.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe finance ministry announced loan melas in 400 districts to be held in early October. The loans are to be issued with focus on 3 main sectors: retail, agriculture and MSME. The banks are to bring in 5 new clients for every pre-existing client.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe banks will not declare stressed loans lent to MSMEs as non-performing asset until March 2020. There is also an RBI circular providing the same incentive. The loans are instead to be recast. The measure is in line with the series of economic boosters introduced by the government."
