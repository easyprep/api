  "answer": "Sperm whale",
  "explanation": "Seals, Walruses and Sea lions are Mammals belonging to a single taxonomic group ( a clade) called Pinnipedia, which means fin footed. All of them are semi-aquatic marine mammals. They belong to the order Carnivora and their closest living relatives are bears. They are characterized by modification of limbs to flippers. Pinnipeds are mammals with four flippers — one pair in front and one at the back. They are warm-blooded, nurse their young, breathe air and have hair. The sea lion has small, tiny external ear flaps. Seals have no flaps. The front flippers of sea lions are long, have no hair and nails. Seals’ front flippers are short, blunt, covered with hair with nails on the ends. Sea lions can turn their hind flippers forward to move on land but seals cannot do so."
