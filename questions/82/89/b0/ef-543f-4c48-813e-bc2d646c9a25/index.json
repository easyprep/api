  "question": "With reference to the NGT directive to Arunachal Pradesh government to identify illegal deforestation hotspots in Pakke Tiger Reserve, consider the following statements the protected site:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The reserve represent the range limits of Indochinese tigers and Bengal tigers.</li>\n<li>The reserve is known for the ‘Hornbill Nest Adoption Program’.</li>\n<li>The forest belongs to evergreen category.</li>\n</ol>\n     Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe reserve is located in the Chittagong hill region. This region marks the north-western limit of the Indochinese tiger’s range. It also marks the eastern limit of the Bengal tiger’s range. Tigers are territorial and require huge areas to support a relatively small population.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Pakke Tiger Reserve was awarded the India Biodiversity Award in 2016 for its ‘Hornbill Nest Adoption Program’. Hornbills are slow breeders and are monogamous. The reserve forest has Great Hornbill, the Wreathed Hornbill, the Oriental Pied Hornbill and the Rufous-necked Hornbill. The program involves the cooperation of the native Nyishi community to protect hornbill nesting sites.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nThe Pakke tiger reserve is represented by evergreen forests. The region also contains semi-evergreen forests and Eastern Himalayan Broadleaf forests. It is in a major biodiversity hotspot. The forests are vital for conservation of species like the hornbill, which are very vulnerable to habitat loss."
