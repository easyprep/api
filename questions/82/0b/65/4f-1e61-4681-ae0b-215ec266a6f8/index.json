  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "Recently, India decided to restart negotiations with the new regime in Nepal on setting up the 6480 MW Pancheshwar multi-purpose hydro-electric project. Pancheswar is a multi-purpose project conceived under the 1996 Mahakali treaty between India and Nepal. The project is expected to submerge 11,600 hectares of mountain area out of which 7,600 hectares are in three districts of Uttarakhand while the rest is in Nepal. Due to this, the project still remains a contentious issue and has been not finalised till now. The project is to come up near the Pancheshwar temple, 2.5 km downstream of the confluence of the Mahakali and Sarju rivers. The project will have two dams for India and Nepal working in tandem."
