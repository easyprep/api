  "question": "&nbsp; The&nbsp;height&nbsp;(h) to which a&nbsp;liquid&nbsp;will&nbsp;rise&nbsp;in a capillary&nbsp;tube: <ol> <li>increases with increase in surface tension of liquid</li> <li>decreases with increase in radius of the tube</li> </ol> &nbsp; &nbsp;Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The height (h) to which a liquid will rise in a capillary tube is directly proportional to surface tension of liquid and inversely proportional to radius of the tube."
