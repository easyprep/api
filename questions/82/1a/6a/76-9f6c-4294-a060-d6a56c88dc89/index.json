  "question": "Consider the following statements about the “Project Brainwave”: <ol> <li>It is an initiative by Microsoft</li> <li>It aims to promote artificial intelligence based product &amp; services</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct because “Project Brainwave” is an initiative by the software giant Microsoft. The project aims to promote product &amp; services based on real-time artificial intelligence (AI). The project uses the massive field-programmable gate array (FPGA) infrastructure that Microsoft has been deploying over the past few years. By attaching high-performance FPGAs directly to data centre network, it can serve DNNs as hardware micro services, where a DNN can be mapped to a pool of remote FPGAs and called by a server with no software in the loop."
