  "option1": "Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR)",
  "option2": "Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG)",
  "option3": "Wassenaar Arrangement",
  "option4": "Australia Group",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR)",
  "explanation": "India recently became the member of Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). India now hopes that its membership will make US to consider its exporting Category 1 UAVs, Reaper and Global Hawk, which have played key role to counter-terrorism efforts in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen. Till now these drones have been sold to only one country, the UK, though unarmed versions have also been made available to Italy and South Korea. India is still not a member of Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), Wassenaar Arrangement and Australia Group."
