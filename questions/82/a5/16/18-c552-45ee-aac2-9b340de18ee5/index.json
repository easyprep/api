It will be seed-funded by two alumni members - Aneesh Reddy & Aditya Choubey. The purpose of the \\'Aditya Choubey Center for Re-Water Research\\' is to tackle the challenge of resolving two burning issues faced by urban India - sewage disposal and access to clean potable water. The institute will set up an on-campus plant which will convert 1.35 million litre of sewage water from the hostels to 1.2 million litre of potable water, on a daily basis. The project is being developed to attract potential entrepreneurs and government agencies to take up sewage treatment at a large scale and with a business model for banks to gain confidence in funding such businesses. The pilot plant is expected to be ready by March 2019."
