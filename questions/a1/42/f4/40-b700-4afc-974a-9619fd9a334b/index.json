  "explanation": "Lake Guija is a lake in Central America. The lake is situated on the border between Guatemala and El Salvador. The lake is of volcanic origin and was formed by a large basaltic lava flow from the San Diego volcano which blocked the Guija depression's original drainage. Lake Guija is fed by the Ostua, Angue and Cusmapa rivers and is drained on its southeastern side by the Rio Desague, a tributary of the Rio Lempa. The lake is surrounded by the volcanic cones of the Mita, San Diego and Cerro Quemado.",
