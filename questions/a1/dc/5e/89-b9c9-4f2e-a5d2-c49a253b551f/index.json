  "question": "Which IIT institute to develop prototypes for self-piloted Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft?",
  "option1": "IIT Guwahati",
  "option2": "IIT Kanpur",
  "option3": "IIT Delhi",
  "option4": "IIT Kolkata",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "IIT Kanpur",
  "explanation": "The Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur (IIT-K) has signed a Rs 15 crore-Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the VTOL Aviation Pvt Ltd to develop prototypes for self-piloted Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft. These prototypes will be used as air taxis for civilians. The VTOL technology equips the aircraft to perform manoeuvres that are impossible with traditional aircraft, and also comes across as a big advantage for air combat and rescue. Other features like an ability to carry enough payload and minimal readiness time make it handy in emergency situations like rapid deployment of ground troops, precise location hovering for delivery of supplies. These aircraft will also be very useful for rapid medical evacuation of troops from difficult terrains.",
