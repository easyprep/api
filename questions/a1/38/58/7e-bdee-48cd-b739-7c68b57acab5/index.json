  "question": "With reference to Mirage, which among the following statements is / are correct? <br> 1.The refractive index of hot air is greater than cold air <br> 2.When light rays pass from hotter to cooler layers of air, they curve downward<br> 3.The phenomenon of Superior mirage is most commonly found in polar regions<br> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "As the cold air is denser than warm air, so it has a greater refractive index. When light rays pass from hotter to cooler layers of air, they tend to move downward. Superior mirages mainly witnessed in polar regions. A mirage is a illusion of water which is caused by the refraction of light."
