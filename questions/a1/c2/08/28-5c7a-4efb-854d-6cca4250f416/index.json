  "question": "In context with the recent studies about ancient hurricanes, geographical features called blue holes have been highlighted. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Blue holes support the most diverse habitats in marine ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Blue holes contain carbonate sand.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nBlue holes are circular depression found in marine systems. These are sinkholes which formed during the ice age. They are anoxic i.e., oxygen deficient after a certain depth and have poor water circulation. Because of this they cannot support many life-forms other than bacteria. However, fossils have been found here.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nBlue holes are generally derived from limestone structures. Hence they possess carbonate sand made from limestone or coral skeletons. The white color of the carbonate sand contributes to its characteristic deep blue color. Example of blue holes are Dragon Hole in South China Sea and Deanâ€™s Blue Hole in the Bahamas."
