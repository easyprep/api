  "question": "Which country's <em>de jure</em> part, as recognized by the United Nations, but a <em>de facto</em>-unrecognized state is \"Abkhazia\"?",
  "option1": "Azerbaijan",
  "option2": "Armenia",
  "option3": "Georgia",
  "option4": "Kazakhstan",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Georgia",
  "explanation": "Abkhazia is a de facto state in the South Caucasus recognised by most countries as part of Georgia, which views the region as an autonomous republic. It lies on the eastern coast of the Black Sea, south of the Greater Caucasus mountains in northwestern Georgia. The status of Abkhazia is a central issue of the Georgian–Abkhazian conflict and Georgia–Russia relations. The polity is recognised as a state by Russia, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Nauru and Syria. While Georgia lacks control over Abkhazia, the Georgian government and most United Nations member states consider Abkhazia legally part of Georgia, with Georgia maintaining an official government-in-exile."
