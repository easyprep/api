  "question": "An Electric generator is based on which of the following scientific principles?",
  "option1": "Faraday's law of Electromagnetic Induction",
  "option2": "Super Conductivity",
  "option3": "Laws of Thermodynamics",
  "option4": "Newton's Law of Motion",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Faraday's law of Electromagnetic Induction",
  "explanation": "An Electric generator works on the principle of Faraday's law of Electromagnetic Induction. An electric generator uses mechanical energy to generate electricity applying Faraday's law of induction. It spins a coil at a constant rate in a magnetic field to induce an oscillating emf."
