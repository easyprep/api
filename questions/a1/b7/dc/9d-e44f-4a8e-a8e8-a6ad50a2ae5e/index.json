Though, the employment will be awarded only to members of those families which do not have a government job at present. As per scheme, CM Chamling handed over appointment letters to over 12,000 unemployed youths at a \\\"Rojgar Mela\\\" (employment fair) at the Paljor stadium, Gangtok. The task of providing employment was entrusted to the Department of Personnel. He also declared that all loan debts in the farming and agriculture sector would be revoked. As of now, the state government has over 1 lakh regularised employees on its rolls from a population of just 6.4 lakh. Sikkim is the only state in the country that gives the highest salaries to state government employees."
