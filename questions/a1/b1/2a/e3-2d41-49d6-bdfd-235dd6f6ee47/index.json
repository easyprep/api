  "question": "With reference to the recent discussions on contribution of pastoralism to the environment, consider the following statements about pastoralism in India:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The Maldhari pastoralists inhabit the grasslands of Maharashtra.</li>\n<li>The pastoralists in India have legal access to grazing lands.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Maldhari community are traditional pastoralists. They inhabit the Banni grassland regions of Gujarat. They rear large ruminants like cows and buffaloes. They also herd cattle of outsiders from Rajasthan. Their main destination is irrigated lands of northern and southern Gujarat.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nIndia does not legally recognise the pastoralism profession. Because of this, the pastoralists do not have legal access to grazing lands. These lands are encroached by agricultural intensification and industrial expansions. Because of this, the pastoralists are a disappearing lot in India."
