  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Ispati Irada is a campaign of the ministry of steel. It was launched to encourage appropriate use of steel. The campaign is in line with the ministry’s attempt to discourage outflow/ export of natural resources, it seeks to bring the focus onto value addition in steel.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:        </strong>\nP V Sindhu was given the post of brand ambassador of the campaign. The campaign also saw the launch of the Ispati Irada logo which can be used by the followers of this scheme. The scheme was highlighted during the ministry’s recent call for ‘green steel’ mission."
