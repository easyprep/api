As the fish contains high nutritional values including minerals, proteins and vitamin B12, it is threatened by an overwhelming demand.\r\nIn December 2016, the United Nations General Assembly voted to officially observe the World Tuna Day on May 3, 2020. This supports the efforts towards attaining SDG 14, to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources from the SDG."
