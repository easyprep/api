  "explanation": "The International Albinism Awareness Day (IAAD) is observed every year on June 13 to celebrate the human rights of persons with albinism worldwide. The 2019 theme is  \\\"Still Standing Strong\\\".  This is a call to recognize, celebrate and stand in solidarity with persons with albinism around the world, and to support their cause â€“ from their accomplishments and positive practices to the promotion and protection of their human rights. Albinism is a congenital disorder characterized in humans by the complete or partial absence of pigment in the skin, hair and eyes. It is associated with a number of vision defects such as photophobia, nystagmus, and amblyopia.  Albinism sufferers face social stigma, obstacles in access to areas of health and education and ignorance in social and political arenas."
