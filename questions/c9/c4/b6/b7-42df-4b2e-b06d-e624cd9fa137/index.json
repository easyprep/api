  "question": "The world's biggest-ever X- ray laser \"European XFEL\" has generated its first X-ray laser light from which country?",
  "option1": "France",
  "option2": "Germany",
  "option3": "Italy",
  "option4": "Belgium",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Germany",
  "explanation": "European X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL), the biggest X-ray laser in the world, has generated its first beam of light in a 3.4 km-long underground facility from the German city of Hamburg to the town of Schenefeld that will allow scientists to get a glimpse of new materials, drugs and chemical reactions at the atomic level. The laser\\'s light is a billion times brighter than the typical light sources normally used in particle accelerators. The European XFEL has a wavelength of 0.8 nanometres and can be used to make pictures and videos of objects at an atomic level. The laser will be used to photograph biomolecules, from which researchers hope to understand the basis of illnesses and develop new therapies."
