  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Both are correct statements<br> Hard water is generally found in areas where groundwater is in contact with limestone, chalk and dolomite and gets higher amount of calcium and magnesium dissolved in it. Soft water is found in areas where groundwater usually travels through peat, igneous rock or sandstone sources, and does not contain as much calcium and magnesium. In fact, it contains higher amount of sodium ions."
