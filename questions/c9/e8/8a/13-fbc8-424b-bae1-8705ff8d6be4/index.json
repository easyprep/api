  "answer": "1 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nNew York Convention or the Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Award, enforced in 1958 is considered a foundational instrument for international arbitration. The contracting states’ courts are required to arbitrate and enforce the arbitration of other contracting states’ courts. It is based on UNCITRAL model law for international arbitration.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nIndia is a member of the UN Commission on International Arbitration Law. The UNCITRAL was established by the UNGA to unify and harmonize international trade law. Membership to the commission is for a term of 6 years. India’s membership is to expire by the year 2022.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe US federal court is trying the Devas- Antrix case under USA’s Foreign Sovereign Immunities act. It allows the country to file lawsuits against foreign states. FSIA is the exclusive basis for such action in the US. It is based on the “Restrictive Theory of Sovereign Immunity” according to which only the public Acts, and not the private Acts, are entitled to immunity."
