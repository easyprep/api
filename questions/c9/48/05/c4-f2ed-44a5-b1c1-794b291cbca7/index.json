  "question": "The UNCTAD reported on the contributions of the private sector to global GDP recently. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The public sector debt constitutes a greater part of GDP than the private sector debt.</li>\n<li>The UNCTAD predicts that the private sector will enable the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe UNCTAD report shows that the private sector debt exceeds the public sector debts as a percentage of the GDP around the world. This is applicable even to developed economies. While the public sector debt constituted 51% of GDP in 2017, the private sector accounted for 139% for the same period.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe UNCTAD/ United Nations Conference on Trade and Development reported that the world cannot depend on the private sector to achieve the SDGs by 2030. This arises from the fact that its global debt share has increased 12 fold in less than 40 years.\n&nbsp;"
