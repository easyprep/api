  "question": "In October, the government planned to adopt a human milk bank model. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is to be based on the Brazilian model.</li>\n<li>India has set the target for achieving 100% access to breast milk by 2025.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe model that is to be adopted by the ministry of health and family welfare is to be based on the Brazilian Human Milk Bank. It is one of the recipients of WHO good practices award. It was developed by the country in response to its high infant mortality rate.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe centre has set the target to ensure the access of breast milk to 70% of the infants by 2025. The target is to be raised to 100% after this initial goal is reached. The access to breast milk will reduce the incidence of infant mortality in India and also improve the overall health of infants."
