  "question": "Which one of the following is present in the largest amount in terms of per cent by mass in the earth’s crust?",
  "option1": "Silicon",
  "option2": "Oxygen",
  "option3": "Carbon",
  "option4": "Calcium",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Oxygen",
  "explanation": "Oxygen is by far the most abundant element in the earth\\'s crust. Scientists estimate oxygen comprises nearly half of the mass of the crust. It also accounts for 21 percent of Earth\\'s atmosphere. Almost 97% of Earth’s crust is made up of just eight elements.<br />Elements occurred in Earth crust in form of minerals or in compound form. The mineral composition of our planets crust is highly non-uniform. Earth is missing a great deal of the volatile elements such as hydrogen, helium, neon, and nitrogen, as well as carbon which has been lost as volatile hydrocarbons. The remaining elemental composition is roughly typical of the \\\"rocky\\\" inner planets."
