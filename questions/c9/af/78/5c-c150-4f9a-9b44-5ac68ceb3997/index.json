  "question": "In context with the recent survey conducted on the losses suffered by the coffee growers due to ‘fruit drop’, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Fruit drop in coffee plants occur during the pre-mature stages.</li>\n<li>Floods and increased rainfall increases fruit drop in coffee.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nFruit drop is more common during the pre-mature phases in the coffee plant. Early stages of berries in the coffee plants are usually found during the June to July period and this is when the fruit drop is maximum. This is a source of economic loss to the coffee growers.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nFlood and very heavy rainfall causes a condition in coffee plants called ‘wet feet’. This increases the frequency and intensity of fruit drop. This is because, excessive wetness prevents proper drainage and leads to fungal infections and rotting of the plant."
