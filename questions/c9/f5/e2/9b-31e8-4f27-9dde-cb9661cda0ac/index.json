  "question": "With reference to the Thirty Meter Telescope project and the protests surrounding it, consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>The intended site of TMT project, Mauna Kea Mountain, is a dormant volcano.</li>\n<li>TMT project is the first summit observatory in this region.</li>\n<li>India is one of the funding partners of this project.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "None of the above",
  "option3": "All of the above",
  "option4": "1 and 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong> Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nMauna Kea is a dormant volcano and its summit, when measured from the mountain foot (which is below the ocean level), is at a height of 10,000m. This makes it taller than the Everest, in this aspect. It is located in state of Hawaii. It is a US National Natural Landmark- a designation that calls for voluntary preservation measures.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe mountain already holds 13 other summit observatories. These are projects from 11 different countries. The site is attractive for such setups because of low light pollution, low pollution and its clearance from the inversion layer. This makes observation very clear and enables some of the world’s best astronomical seeing.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe TMT project is funded by a number of bodies- Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Caltech, etc. India became an observer in the TMT board in 2010, and is represented by astronomical research institutes like the IIA/ Indian Institute of Astrophysics. In 2012, it became a partner in the TMT board and will be funding the construction costs. Apart from India, China and Canada are also contributors.\n&nbsp;"
