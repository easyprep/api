  "answer": "Yuwa",
  "explanation": "Yuwa, a Jharkhand-based NGO which works for girl empowerment, has won the prestigious 2019 Laureus Sport for Good Honour at Monaco. The NGO was founded in rural Jharkhand in 2009 by Americans Franz Gastler and Rose Thomson Gastler. They are using football to improve the lives of young girls from disadvantaged communities and from regions where child marriage is prevalent. They are currently covering 450 girls - some amateurs and some who have gone on to become coaches.  It was only the third time the honour was coming to India. The first time was in 2004 when the cricket teams of India and Pakistan were jointly declared the winner for resuming the bilateral series despite the political tension between the countries. Then 10 years later, Magic Bus won it for transforming the lives of the underprivileged children in the country."
