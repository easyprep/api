  "explanation": "The origin of the South-South co-operation lies in the failure of the North-South dialogue or co-operation. As the North did not respond favourably to the demand of the South for reduction in tariff liberalisation, international commodity agreements to stabilise prices,\r\nofficial aid at concessional rates and reforms in the International Monetary System, the countries of the south were convinced that there was no common ground between North and South. United Nation confirmed this co-operation and declare 19th December the annual UN Day for South-South cooperation."
