It\\'s the first time that a transgender has been appointed as an election ambassador in India. According to the Election Commission, Gauri Sawant\\'s appointment would help in more people from this category getting registered during the final phase of voters enrollment. It stated that in the next few days, Gauri Sawant would visit every transgender and inspire them about the need for voting. During 2004 and 2009 Lok Sabha elections there was no record of transgender voters.  Following the Supreme Court order, transgenders got the right to vote for the first time in 2014. In 2014, 918 voters were registered in this third category. This number has doubled in five years and now it is 2,086. There are 113, 184, and 123 registered transgenders in constituencies of Bhiwandi, Kalyan,  and East Mumbai respectively. North Mumbai constituency has registered the maximum number of 324 transgender."
