  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Georgia",
  "explanation": "Georgia's intangible cultural heritage is \"Technology and culture of the Lagidze Water\". Laghidze water is a popular Georgian soft drink based on soda and a variety of natural syrups. It has been traditionally mixed in a glass from a soda fountain, but it is also available as a bottled soft drink in a range of flavours. Laghidze water is named after Mitrofan Laghidze, a pharmacist's apprentice in Kutaisi, Georgia, who in 1887 explored the idea of using natural syrups instead of imported flavoured essences in making lemonades. In 1900, the Lagidze Brothers plant in Kutaisi began blending unique proprietary flavours from herbs and fruits. Today, Lagidze waters are produced in a wide range of natural flavours, including quince, pear, citrus fruit, cherry, tarragon, and others. Lagidze waters are distributed in Russia, Ukraine, the three Baltic states, Poland, and Armenia. The technology and culture of the Lagidze Waters were inscribed on the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Georgia list in 2014."
