  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "<p class=\\\"Explanation\\\">The atmospheric temperature governs the type of biodiversity, fertility of soil, the hydrological cycle and many other abiotic and biotic parameters of our planet. It acts as a resource â€“ in the sense that optimum temperature promotes the production and productivity of many natural resources, such as plants, animals and microbes. Adverse temperature may also act as deterrent to production and propagation of these natural resources."
