  "question": "The LCM of two numbers is 30 and their HCF is 5. One of the numbers is 10. The other is:",
  "option1": 20,
  "option2": 15,
  "option3": 5,
  "option4": 25,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 15,
  "explanation": "Because, First number $latex \\\\times$ Second number = LCM $latex \\\\times$ HCF\r\nLet the Second Number be x.\r\nâˆ´ 10x = 30 $latex \\\\times$ 5\r\n$latex =>x=\\\\frac{30\\\\times 5}{10}=15&s=1$\r\nHence option [B] is the right answer."
