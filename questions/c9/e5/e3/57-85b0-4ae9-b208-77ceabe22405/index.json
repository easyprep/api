The agent and council were the judicial authority for the English people residing in Madras and the indigenous people were under the jurisdiction of the Choultry court. Choultry court was an indigenous court under a village headman known as Adigar, i.e. Adhikari, who was responsible for the maintenance of law and order. He administered justice to the natives at the Choultry Court according to long-established usages. After the Mayorâ€™s Court came into existence, the Choultry Court lost its importance and functioned as a court of petty jurisdiction trying offences and civil cases up to 2 pagodas."
