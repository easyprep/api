  "option1": "Armenia",
  "option2": "Russia",
  "option3": "Georgia",
  "option4": "Azerbaijan",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Georgia",
  "explanation": "Borjomi Gorge is a picturesque canyon of the Kura River in central Georgia. The gorge was formed as a result of the Kura River cutting its path through the Lesser Caucasus Mountains where the Trialeti and Meskheti Ranges meet. A significant portion of the Borjomi Gorge is covered by mixed and coniferous forests made up of oak, maple, beech, spruce, fir, and pine. A large portion of the Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park lies within the gorge, as well as the towns of Likani and Borjomi itself. About the time of the Russo-Turkish War (1828â€“29), it was militarily important since it was the natural route southwest through the mountains from Russian-controlled Georgia to the Turkish Pashalik of Akhaltsikhe. It was guarded by a fort or castle called Atskhur."
