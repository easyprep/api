  "question": "Which type of wave is sound wave?",
  "option1": "Transverse wave",
  "option2": "Longitudinal wave",
  "option3": "Electromagnetic wave",
  "option4": "None of the above.",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Longitudinal wave",
  "explanation": "Sound is a longitudinal wave. Longitudinal wave is a wave where the direction of propagation of the wave and movement of particles is in the same direction where as in transverse wave they are perpendicular to each other.Â <br />Extra info: Example of transverse wave is light wave (electromagnetic wave)."
