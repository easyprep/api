  "option1": "Sirocco",
  "option2": "Chinook",
  "option3": "Mistral",
  "option4": "Loo",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Mistral",
  "explanation": "MistralÂ refers to the northerly or north-westerly (i.e. coming from north) cold wind experienced on the shores of the north-west Mediterranean, mainly around the Rhone-delta. It is more intense during the winter, when pressure is relatively high over the European continent and low over the western Mediterranean; it reaches great force in the rear of a deep depression situated over the gulf of lions that is moving away eastwards or south-eastwards.\r\nSirocco is a warm, dry and dusty laden local wind which blows in northerly direction from Sahara desert over North Africa as a dry wind and picks up moisture as it crosses the Mediterranean. Since they carry red dust over Sahara, the rainfall which they cause is called blood rain sometimes."
