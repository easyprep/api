  "answer": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The government of William Bentinck had passed a Resolution in 1829 (Resolution No. XVII) which declared Sati as ‘culpable homicide’ or ‘suicide’ . It was made a punishable offense. The same government was responsible for passing acts for ending slavery, thuggi and female infanticide. However, Human Sacrifice was banned during the tenure of Lord Harding I (1844-48). In those days, the human sacrifice was common among Gonds, which were eventually India’s largest tribe. On the other hand, Dalhousie’s Government was responsible for passing Women Disability Act and Widow Remarriage Act (1856)."
