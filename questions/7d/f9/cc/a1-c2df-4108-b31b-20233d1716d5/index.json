  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about the general distribution of temperature?<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The highest temperatures occur over tropics and sub-tropics than the polar regions</li>\n<li>Diurnal and annual range of temperatures are highest in the interiors of continents.</li>\n<li>Diurnal and annual range of temperatures are least in oceans.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 1",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The highest temperatures occur over tropics and sub-tropics. The lowest temperatures occur in polar and sub polar regions.<br />Diurnal and annual range of temperatures are highest in the interiors of continents due to the effect of continentiality because of no moderating effect of the oceans.<br />Diurnal and annual range of temperatures are least in oceans because the high specific heat of water and mixing of water keep the range low."
