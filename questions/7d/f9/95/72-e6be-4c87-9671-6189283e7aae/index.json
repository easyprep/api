  "question": "Rs. 500 was invested at 12% per annum simple interest and a certain sum of money invested at 10% per annum simple interest. If the sum of the interest on both the sum after 4 years is Rs. 480, the latter sum of money is :",
  "option1": 550,
  "option2": 450,
  "option3": 750,
  "option4": 600,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 600,
  "explanation": "Simple interest gained from Rs. 500 = $latex \\\\frac{500\\\\times 12\\\\times 4}{100}=&s=1$ $latex Rs. 240$\r\nLet the other principal be x. \r\nS.I. gained = Rs. (480 - 240) = Rs. 240\r\n$latex \\\\therefore \\\\frac{x\\\\times 10\\\\times 4}{100}=&s=1$ $latex 240$\r\n$latex =>x=\\\\frac{240\\\\times 100}{40}=&s=1$ $latex 600$\r\nHence option [D] is the right answer."
