  "question": "Ministry of Earth Sciences had launched an advanced Air Quality Early Warning System to predict the places in the Delhi neighbourhood that are likely to burn the crop residue. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It cannot forecast the level of pollutants coming from the source other than stubble burning.</li>\n<li>It is developed by ISRO.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Air Quality Early Warning System can track the pollution from stubble burning in the areas near Delhi. It makes use of satellite to collect the necessary data to ensure accurate prediction. It can predict the air pollution level for the next 72 hours. It can also predict the level of pollution caused by particulate matters PM2.5, PM10 and dust coming from sources other than stubble burning.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThis system was developed by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, under the Ministry of Earth Sciences. It makes use of the data on stubble burning incidents that took place in the last 15 years. It helps authorities to take measures in advance. Using the obtained data, the Centre for Advanced Computing, under Central Pollution Control Board, created the probability maps to provide information on the areas where the chances of stubble burning is high."
