  "question": "Which one of the following materials is very hard and very ductile?",
  "option1": "Carborundum",
  "option2": "Tungsten",
  "option3": "Cast iron",
  "option4": "Nichrome",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Nichrome",
  "explanation": "Nichrome has high melting point because it is very ductile. The metal is very hard and non-fragile. Nichrome is a non-magnetic alloy of nickel, chromium, and iron, usually used as a resistance wire. A common alloy is 80% nickel and 20% chromium, by mass. This alloying provide nichrome properties like hardness and ductility."
