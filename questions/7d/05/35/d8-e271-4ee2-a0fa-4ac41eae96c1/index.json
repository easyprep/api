  "explanation": "<p>The Bourbon Restoration was the period of French history from 1814 to 1830 following the first fall of Napolean in 1814 and his final defeat in the Hundred Days War in 1815, until the July Revolution of 1830. The brothers of the executed Louis XVI, namely Louis XVIII and Charles X, came to power and reigned in a highly conservative fashion. Exiled supporters of the monarchy returned to France. They were nonetheless unable to reverse most of the changes made by the French Revolution and Napoleon. At the Congress of Vienna, they were treated respectfully but had to give up nearly all the territorial gains made since 1789.</p>"
