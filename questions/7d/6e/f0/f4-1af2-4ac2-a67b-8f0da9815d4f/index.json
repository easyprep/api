  "question": "The BRICS members have agreed on a comprehensive approach to combat terror during the recent meeting of Foreign ministers. In this context, consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>BRICS members are signatory to the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism treaty.</li>\n<li>UNSC Resolution 2462 deals with updating counter-terrorism resolutions with the new forms of terror financing.</li>\n<li>India hosted the first meeting of the BRICS working group on counter-terror.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 and 3",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "None of the above",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism is a work in progress. The treaty aims to criminalise international terrorism in all its forms. It looks to counter terror by cutting off terrorists’ access to funds, weapons and also safe havens. A major impediment in concluding the treaty is the absence of a clear definition of ‘terrorism’. States are wary of what actions fall under ‘state terrorism’. The BRICS meet saw the ministers calling for quick resolution of the treaty.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nUNSC resolution 2462 was initiated by France. Its core objective is to evolve ways to counter terrorists’ use of emerging routes for financing- such as prepaid cards and virtual assets. The resolution calls for increased transparency in the financing sector to tackle the terrorists’ use of information and communication technologies.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nIndia hosted the meeting of the working group on counter-terror in 2016. The upcoming 4<sup>th</sup> meeting of the group is to be held in Brazil. The meetings discuss possible routes for cooperation on international platforms like FATF, sharing of information, domestic perspectives on counter-terror, etc."
