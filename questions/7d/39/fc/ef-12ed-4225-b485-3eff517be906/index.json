Elements consist of indivisible small particles (atoms). <br /> 2. All atoms of the same element are identical; different elements have different types of atom. <br /> 3. Atoms can neither be created nor destroyed. <br /> 4. ‘Compound elements’ (i.e. Compounds) are formed when atoms of different elements join in simple ratios to form ‘compound atoms’ (i.e. Molecules)."
