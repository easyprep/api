  "question": "On which of the following, the amount of insolation received by the earth depends upon?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Solar Constant</li>\r\n<li>Position of earth with respect to Sun</li>\r\n<li>Altitude of the Sun</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The intensity of the solar radiation received on a unit area of horizontal surface at the outer limit of the atmosphere is called the solar constant<em>. </em>The average value of solar constant is about 2 gram calories per square centimetre per minute. Amount of Insolation also depends upon earth’s position with respect to sun i.e aphelion and perihelion. It also depends upon sun’s altitude."
