  "answer": "Polar Vortex",
  "explanation": "Polar Vortex is a whirling cold winds present at both North Pole and South Pole.<br> It results because of the increased temperature difference between the dark, frigid Arctic and the warm tropics. There are two vortices, one in the layer of the upper atmosphere known as the stratosphere and one in the lower section, where our weather happens, called the troposphere. These two features interact with each other and can affect the meteorological goings-on outside of the Arctic."
