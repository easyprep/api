  "question": "The scientists of which country have developed a method to convert Jute fibre into low-cost bio-degradable cellulose sheets?",
  "option1": "Sri Lanka",
  "option2": "Myanmar",
  "option3": "India",
  "option4": "Bangladesh",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Bangladesh",
  "explanation": "Scientists in Bangladesh have developed a method to convert Jute fibre into low-cost bio-degradable cellulose sheets named \\'Sonali\\' which can be used as wrapping material and carrying bag. The Eco-friendly jute poly bags made up of Sonali can be used in garments and food packaging work and they are not harmful for human health. The commercial production of these bags is likely to start by the year-end. The main challenge in the large scale adoption of Sonali sheet is the relatively high cost of production which is almost double that of polythene. However, production on a large scale is expected to bring down the cost."
