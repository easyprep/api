  "question": "A binational consortium has recently developed a new supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) Brayton cycle test loop facility at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru. This new waterless super CO<sub>2</sub> test loop facility has been designed to help generate clean energy from future power plants including solar thermal. The consortium responsible for the development of this new cycle also aims for the development of high temperature concentrated solar power in the country. The name of the consortium is _?",
  "option1": "GALEX",
  "option2": "SERIIUS",
  "option3": "TRACE",
  "option4": "ARCTAS",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "SERIIUS",
  "explanation": "SERIIUS stands for the Solar Energy Research Institute for India and the United States. It is co-led by the Indian Institute of Science (IISc)â€”Bangalore, India, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Golden, Colorado, USA. It aims to accelerate the development of solar electric technologies by lowering the cost per watt of photovoltaics (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP) and create a strong workforce development program in solar energy science and technology. Supercritical carbon dioxide-based power generation is said to offer an efficient alternative to conventional steam-based power plants and reduce the carbon footprint of power generation significantly."
