  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nA company is designated as a Unicorn when its value exceeds a billion USD. The term is used in reference to the rarity of such privately owned companies. Similar companies that are valued over 10 billion USD are called decacorn.

It accounts for 49% of global share of such high valued companies. China holds the second spot with 25% share of Unicorns. However, China holds some of the most valuable unicorns in the world. The report found that most of the Unicorns are in the categories of software and services, followed by fintech and e-commerce.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nChina has 3 out of the top 5 most valued Unicorns in the world. The most valuable is Chinaâ€™s Bytedance that is responsible for the controversial Tiktok app in India. Didi Chuxing and Juul Labs are other valuable players from China.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is correct:\nIndia was ranked at the fourth position by the report. It stands behind UK with a difference of 1%. India holds 4% while UK has 5% of Unicorns in the world. 2018 was a record year for India with significant increase in the Unicorn tribe strength. 2019 is showing an even greater increase with the half-yearly numbers equalling the total number from 2018. The country holds about 25 such companies."
