The greater part of the deposits on the continental shelf and slopes is derived from rock material let loose by disintegration and decomposition by the agents of weathering and carried to sea by the agents of erosion, such as running water, wind, etc.<br />The larger particles of terrigenous deposits are found near the shore and the finer ones are carried deep.<br />The extent to which they get carried away depends on the size of the rock material."
