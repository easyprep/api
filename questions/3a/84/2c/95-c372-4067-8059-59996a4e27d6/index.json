  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "<strong>Abyssal Plain<br /></strong>Abyssal plain is flat, cold and sediment covered ocean floor. Abyssal plains are more extensive in Atlantic and Indian Oceans and less extensive in Pacific Ocean. Abyssal plain is found at an average depth between 3000 and 6000 meters. They are among the flattest, smoothest and least explored regions on earth.<br /><strong>Oceanic Trench<br /></strong>An elongated through or deep in the ocean floor is called ocean trench. It is more or less a U shaped valley. Most of world’s trenches are in Pacific Ocean. Trenches are most active geological features on earth where great earthquakes are Tsunamis are born. <br /><strong>Seamounts<br /></strong>Seamounts are elliptical projections from the sea floor which look like mountains and have a steep slope of around 22° to 24°. Half of the world’s total seamounts arc in Pacific Ocean.<br /><strong>Guyots<br /></strong>Guyots are basically inactive volcanoes which are flat topped. Some of them are tall enough to approach or even penetrate the sea surface. Guyots are confined to Central Pacific Ocean."
