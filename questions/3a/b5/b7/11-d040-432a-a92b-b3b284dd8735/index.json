  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "The Constitution ensures that the State observes an attitude of neutrality and impartiality towards all religions. To start with, there shall be no \\'state religion\\' in India. Article 27 stipulates that the State shall not compel anyone \\\"to pay any taxes, the proceeds of which are specifically appropriated, in the payment of expenses for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination.\\\" Further, no religious instruction shall be provided in any educational institution \\\"wholly maintained out of State funds.\\\" Moreover, \\\"no person attending any educational institution recognised by the State or receiving aid out of State funds, shall be required to take part in any religious instruction\\\" against his or her will (Article 28). Secondly, every person is guaranteed the freedom of conscience and the freedom to profess, practice and propagate his/her own religion, subject to restrictions imposed by the State in the interests of public order, morality and health. Every individual has the right to practice and propagate not only matters of faith or belief but also all those rituals and observations, which are regarded as integral parts of a religion by the followers of its doctrines. According to the Supreme Court, regulation by the State cannot interfere with things which are essentially religious. Not only does the individual have the freedom to profess, practice and propagate his/her religion, there is also a right guaranteed to every religious group or denomination, to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes. (Articles 25 &amp; 26). Besides guaranteeing the fundamental right to religious freedom, the Constitution stipulates that the State shall not discriminate against a citizen in any matter, in particular in the matter of employment, on the ground of religion. No citizen can be discriminated against on the grounds of religion, caste and so on, as regards access to public places (Article 15) and admission to educational institutions (Article 29)."
