  "question": "Whom did Gandhi consult before suspending the non-cooperation movement on 12 February 1922?",
  "option1": "Congress Working Committee",
  "option2": "Khilafat Committee",
  "option3": "Jawaharlal Nehru",
  "option4": "None of them",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of them",
  "explanation": "Non-cooperation movement had picked up steam by end of 1921 when over 30,000 people were in British jails, including all the top Congress leaders. However, Gandhi suddenly suspended the non-cooperation movement on 12 February 1922, without consulting any of the stakeholders, including the Muslim leaders of the Khilafat Movement. The reason was the perishing of 23 policemen when the Chauri Chaura Police Station in the Gorakhpur district of UP was set on fire in a retaliatory violence on 4 February 1922. Police had arrested leaders of a group picketing a liquor shop in the market place. In protest, a crowd gathered in front of the police station shouting slogans. The police opened fire into the crowd killing three and wounding several. Angered by the unprovoked firing, the protestors set fire to the police station, killing the policeman as a result."
