  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nIt is a landlocked lake i.e. endorheic in nature. It is located at an altitude of 14,000ft in the Ladakh Himalayas. It has brackish water that freezes in the winter. It is an elongated lake with one end near Leh. It has been the site of scuffles between Indian and Chinese soldiers.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Line of Actual Control passes through the lake. However, the exact layout of the LAC is disputed between India and China. With reference to the Indian and Chinese patrols coming face-to-face with each other here, they use the ‘banner drill’ and quietly disengage."
