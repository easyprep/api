  "question": "Which of the following countries has an 'unwritten' constitution?",
  "option1": "Britain",
  "option2": "USA",
  "option3": "China",
  "option4": "Russia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Britain",
  "explanation": "Britain is unusual in that it has an 'unwritten' constitution: unlike the great majority of countries there is no single legal document which sets out in one place the fundamental laws outlining how the state works. Britain's lack of a 'written' constitution can be explained by its history."
