  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about impact crater?<br />\n<ol>\n<li>They are formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body</li>\n<li>The have similar composition like sinkholes, glacial cirques,etc</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "Impact crater is a type of impact landform formed due to collision of astronomical objects. Impact crater is a circular depression formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. Impact craters should not be confused with landforms like sinkholes, glacial cirques which are different in composition and origin from the impact crater."
