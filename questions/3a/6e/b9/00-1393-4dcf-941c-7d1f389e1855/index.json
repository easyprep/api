  "option4": "Canadian Space Agency",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "NASA",
  "explanation": "Jerrie Cobb (88), NASA’s first female astronaut candidate, has passed away in Florida on March 18, 2019. In 1961, Cobb became the first woman to pass astronaut testing. Altogether, 13 women passed the arduous physical testing and became known as the Mercury 13. But NASA already had its Mercury 7 astronauts, all test pilots and men. None of the Mercury 13 ever reached space, despite Cobb\\'s testimony in 1962 before a Congressional panel.  She wrote in her 1997 autobiography ``Jerrie Cobb, Solo Pilot\\', ``My country, my culture, was not ready to allow a woman to fly in space”.  Cobb also served for decades as a humanitarian aid pilot in the Amazon jungle."
