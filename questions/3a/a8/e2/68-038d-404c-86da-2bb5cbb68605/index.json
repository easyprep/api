  "explanation": "The state government of Gujarat has launched a dedicated ambulance service for infants to prevent the death of newborns due to lack of emergency medical facilities in health centres. This service is under the 'Neonatal ambulance service project for inter-hospital transfer'. It would consist of 10 well equipped ambulances across the state. The service started as a pilot project in Jamnagar Civil Hospital. This project would help newborns of the primary health care centres in the rural areas as they do not have needed medical services available. The ambulance would have special equipment such as baby warmer machines, on-board treatment and comfort.",
