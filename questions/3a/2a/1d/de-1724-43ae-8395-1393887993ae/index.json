  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Both are correct statements<br> Both X-Rays and gamma rays refer to waves in the electromagnetic spectrum. While gamma rays are produced during nuclear decay by nuclei of atoms, X-rays are produced by electrons. Gamma rays have shorter wavelength than X- rays."
