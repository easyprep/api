  "question": "Which country houses \"Ngwenya Mines\"?",
  "option1": "Eswatini",
  "option2": "Togo",
  "option3": "Burundi",
  "option4": "Liberia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Eswatini",
  "explanation": "Ngwenya Mine is situated on the north-western border of Swaziland. Its iron ore deposits constitute one of the oldest geological formations in the world, and also have the distinction of being the site of the world's earliest mining activity. Ngwenya, which means crocodile, describes the shape of Eswatini’s second-highest mountain, looming above the Ngwenya border post. On its southern flank is the oldest mine in the world – an iron ore mine dated by archaeologists to at least 43,000 years ago. The mineral mined here was specularite, an ore with a glittering sheen that was traditionally worn by chiefs as body paint for ceremonial occasions. All that remains today of the ancient mine is a modest hole in the hillside, known as Lion Cavern – not to be confused with the much larger flooded quarry nearby, left by more modern mining operations."
