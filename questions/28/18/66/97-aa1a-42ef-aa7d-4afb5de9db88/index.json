  "answer": "Chennai",
  "explanation": "On November 29,2019 the Greater Chennai Police received the Union government’s SKOCH Award under the category ‘Swachh Police Station’, for maintaining cleanliness in all their police stations. This comes after the police’s efforts to clear up abandoned and unclaimed vehicles from all station premises. A huge pile of abandoned and unclaimed vehicles around nearly all police stations in the Greater Chennai area used to take up a lot of space, besides giving the stations a shabby look. On the instruction of Commissioner of Police A.K. Viswanathan, senior officers took account of all these vehicles in each police station in the city."
