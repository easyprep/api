  "question": "The researchers at which IIT have develop lab grown meat?",
  "option1": "IIT-Bombay",
  "option2": "IIT-Guwahati",
  "option3": "IIT-Delhi",
  "option4": "IIT-Madras",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "IIT-Guwahati",
  "explanation": "The researchers at IIT-Guwahati have developed a novel technique for production of meat which is completely natural. The lab-grown meat is nutritious and will be a step towards cruelty-free food.  The taste of the final meat product will remain similar as raw meat but with improvised nutritional values as per customer needs.  The product can be printed in varying shapes and sizes using a 3D bioprinter with the edible components and preserved for future use. According to researchers, the meat industry has been facing immense pressure in keeping up with the food requirements due to rapid increase in population.  Citing predictions from the UN population prospects,  Dr Biman B Mandal stated that the current meat industry will not be able to meet the global needs by 2050. Around 4,000 litres of water are required to produce one kg chicken meat and more than 8,000 litres of water are required to produce one kg of mutton.  Hence, the lab grown meat made will have immense value in the Indian as well as the foreign market as it is nutritious and can be tuned for the high in demand needs of fast-food joints."
