  "question": "Consider the following statements: Small-scale industries are, in most cases, not as efficient and competitive as the large-scale ones. Yet the Government provides preferential treatment and reservations in a range of products to the small firms because small-scale industries<br />I. provide higher employment on a per unit capital deployment basis.<br />II. Promote a regional dispersion of industries and economic activities.<br />III. Have performed better in export of manufactured products than the large scale ones.<br />IV. Provide jobs to low-skill workers, who otherwise may not find employment avenues elsewhere.<br />Which of the above statements are correct?",

  "option2": "I and II",
  "option3": "II and III",

Small scale, industries have a low capital output ratio and give employment to larger number of workers. As they use raw material they can be dispersed over a wider area."
