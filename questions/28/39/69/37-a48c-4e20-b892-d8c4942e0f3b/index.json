  "question": "Which among the following pairs of basins is/are correctly matched?<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Endorheic basin - closed hydrological systems</li>\n<li>Exorheic basin - open hydrological systems</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Endorheic basin is a limited drainage basin that normally retains water and allows no outflow to other external bodies of water, such as rivers or oceans. It is a closed hydrological system.<br />Exorheic basins flow into the oceans in a geologically defined patterns. They are open hydrological systems."
