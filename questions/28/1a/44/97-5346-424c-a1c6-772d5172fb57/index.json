  "explanation": "Recently, the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) has directed the assistant registrar of the Geographical Indications Registry to provide the GI status to Basmati rice produced in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand and parts of Uttar Pradesh and Jammu &amp; Kashmir. Madhya Pradesh was not included in the list even though the state has Basmati producing areas. Madhya Pradesh government wants the registrar of geographical indications (GI) to include the state as a certified grown area. Madhya Pradesh government has moved against the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) order that directed the registrar of geographical indications to issue a GI tag for basmati rice in India, excluding the areas of Madhya Pradesh. The common description of basmati rice in the world is- Rice grown in the foothills of Himalayas spanning India and Pakistan."
