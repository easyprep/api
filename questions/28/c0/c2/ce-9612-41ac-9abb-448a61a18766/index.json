  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Canada",
  "explanation": "Saint Pierre and Miquelon, also known as the overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, is a self-governing territorial overseas collectivity of France, situated in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean near the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Therefore, Canada is the only country that shares a maritime boundary with Saint Pierre and Miquelon. It is the only part of New France that remains under French control. Saint Pierre and Miquelon Islands are situated in the Gulf of St.Lawrence near the entrance of Fortune Bay, in the northern Atlantic Ocean. The Canada-France Maritime Boundary Case was a dispute between Canada and France that was decided in 1992 by an arbitral tribunal created by the parties to resolve the dispute. The decision established the extent of the Exclusive Economic Zone of the French territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon."
