  "question": "In India, the State re-organisation in the North East is mainly based on __:",
  "option1": "Linguistic regions",
  "option2": "Ethnic Factors",
  "option3": "Administrative convenience",
  "option4": "Geographic factors",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Administrative convenience",
  "explanation": "Indian languages are classified in four broad categories - Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Austric and Sino-Tibetan. The geographical distribution of the major languages in India neatly fits into a scheme of linguistic regions. Hence the linguistic re-organisation of States that took place in 1956. But for the North-East, State re-organisation is based neither on linguistic nor on ethnic factors. It is based on administrative convenience. This is why the contiguous Naga habitations fall into four States: Nagaland, Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh."
