  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Troposphere is the lowermost layer of the earth's atmosphere. The height of troposphere is about 18 km on the equator and 8 km on the poles. The thickness of the troposphere is greatest at the equator. It contains dust particles and water vapour. This layer is called ‘changing sphere’ or troposphere because the air never remains static in this layer."
