  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Burundi",
  "explanation": "Recently, Burundi became the first United Nation country ever to leave the international criminal court. Burundi withdrew from the Rome Statute on October 18, 2016, when President Pierre Nkurunziza of Burundi signed legislation calling for Burundi’s withdrawal from the ICC. Burundi’s government claimed the court is an instrument of powerful countries used to punish leaders who do not comply with the West. The decision to withdraw came after the United Nations Human Rights Council resolved, on September 30, to create a commission of inquiry into human rights abuses in Burundi since April 2015 that would identify alleged perpetrators and recommend steps to guarantee that they are held accountable."
