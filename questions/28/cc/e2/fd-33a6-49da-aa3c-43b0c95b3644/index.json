  "question": "Consider the following statements: <br> 1. A body at rest has no inertia <br> 2. A body in free fall in vacuum has constant acceleration<br> 3. A body in free fall in vacuum has diminishing kinetic energy<br> Which among the above is / are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "According to Newton's first law a body at rest tends to stay at rest. It is also denotes inertia. Free falling object through a vacuum has only one external force which is the gravitational force. So it experiences constant acceleration."
