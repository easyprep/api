  "question": "What happens to the molar conductivity of a weak electrolyte in case of dilution?",
  "option1": "No change",
  "option2": "increases slowly",
  "option3": "increases steeply",
  "option4": "decreases slowly",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "increases steeply",
  "explanation": "In case of weak electrolyte, molar conductivity increases steeply on dilution, especially near lower concentrations. The weak electrolytes have lower degree of dissociation at higher concentrations."
