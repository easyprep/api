  "question": "&nbsp; Consider the following differences between Earth and Moon: <ol> <li>While there are seasons on Earth, there are no seasons on Moon</li> <li>The length of a day is much shorter on Earth than on the Moon&nbsp;</li> </ol> &nbsp;&nbsp; Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Both are correct statements<br> The axial tilt of earth is about 23.44 degrees. The axial tilt of earth is responsible for seasons on earth. The moon&rsquo;s axis is tilted only about 1.5 degrees and hence, there are no seasons on moon. Similarly, the length of a day on the Earth is 24 hours, while the length of a day on the moon is equal to slightly over 27 Earth days.&nbsp;"
