  "question": "Why the strong tropical cyclones lose their strength when they pass on to land?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Land terrain impedes the movement of Cyclone</li>\r\n<li>Land absorbs the heat energy of Cyclone quickly</li>\r\n<li>Cyclone is cut from its heat source</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "The first statement is correct. The Friction over land increases considerably from that over water, and this acts to weaken the storm’s structure. This is especially true over rugged terrains and mountains in particular. But the real reason is something very important. We know that the deep convection is a driving force for tropical cyclones. The convection is strongest in a tropical climate, it defines the initial domain of the tropical cyclone. This is a major difference between the Tropical cyclones with other mid-latitude cyclones as the later derive their energy mostly from pre-existing horizontal temperature gradients in the atmosphere. To continue to drive its heat engine, a tropical cyclone must remain over warm water, which provides the needed atmospheric moisture to keep the positive feedback loop running. When a tropical cyclone passes over land, it is cut off from its heat source and its strength diminishes rapidly. The moving over land deprives it of the warm water it needs to power itself, quickly losing strength. Thus, most strong storms lose their strength when the pass on to land, but if it manages to move back to ocean, it will regenerate. Please also note that when a tropical storm moves over waters significantly below 26.5 °C , it will lose its strength. This is because of losing its tropical characteristic of the warm core."
