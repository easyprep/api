  "question": "A study by Zurich University reported that planting 1.2 trillion trees will cut the carbon dioxide by 66%. Consider the following statements about afforestation:\n<ol>\n<li>National Forest Policy, 2018 seeks to bring 1/4th of India’s geographical expanse under forest cover.</li>\n<li>National Community Forest Management Mission, proposed by the policy, will deal with participatory forest management.</li>\n<li>Greening Punjab Mission seeks to have planted 40 crore saplings by 2020.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 only",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 and 2",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nNational forest Policy 2018 calls for achieving a minimum of 1/3<sup>rd</sup> forest cover in Indian geography by 2020. The policy is released by the union environment ministry. The earlier 2016 draft was replaced with the 2018 draft due to several controversial proposals such as green tax. The first National Forest Policy of India was effected in 1952. The policy, once finalised, will be in force for 25 to 30 years.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe National Forest Policy, 2018 has called for setting up of National Community Forest Management (NCFM) Mission at the centre. It will be dealing with participatory forest management measures. India has a history of public participation in forest management. Eg: Sacred grooves preserve the local biodiversity of flora and fauna.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nGreening Punjab Mission is a Punjab state government mission that seeks to increase its forest cover to 15%. It seeks to plant 40 crore trees by 2020 at the cost of 1900 crore INR, making it a major afforestation drive. Current cover is only about 7%. The National Forest Policy has recommended that 33% of India’s land must be under forest cover.\n&nbsp;"
