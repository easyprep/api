  "question": "What of the following represents Ohm's law (V= potential difference and I=current)?",
  "option1": "V = I <sup>2</sup>",
  "option2": "V = 1/I",
  "option3": "V/I = constant",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "V/I = constant",
  "explanation": "The potential difference, V, across the ends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, provided its temperature remains the same. This is called Ohmâ€™s law. V/I =constant"
