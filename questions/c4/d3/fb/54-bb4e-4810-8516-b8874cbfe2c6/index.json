  "question": "A boat travels 24 km upstream in 6 hours and 20 km downstream in 4 hours. Then the speed of boat in still water and the speed of water current are respectively",
  "option1": "5 km/hr and 2 km/hr",
  "option2": "4 km/hr and 2 km/hr",
  "option3": "4 km/hr and 3 km/hr",
  "option4": "4.5 km/hr and 0.5 km/hr",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "4.5 km/hr and 0.5 km/hr",
  "explanation": "Rate upstream = 4 kmph\r\nRate downstream = 5 kmph\r\nâˆ´ Speed of boat in still water = $latex \\\\frac{1}{2}(4+5)&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{9}{2} = 4.5 kmph&s=1$\r\nSpeed of current = $latex \\\\frac{1}{2}(5-4)&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 kmph&s=1$\r\nHence option [D] is the right answer."
