  "question": "The value of coefficient of limiting friction does not depend on which of the following?",
  "option1": "nature of the surfaces in contact",
  "option2": "total area of the surfaces in contact",
  "option3": "material of the surfaces in contact",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "total area of the surfaces in contact",
  "explanation": "The coefficient of static friction can be defined as the ratio of the limiting static friction and the normal reaction between the 2 surfaces. The value of coefficient of limiting friction depends: 1. Nature of the surfaces in contact. 2. Material of the surfaces in contact"
