  "explanation": "Arbaika Massif (Arabika) is a glacially eroded karst outcropping of the Gagra Range, Abkhazia, internationally recognised as part of Georgia by the United Nations, in the West Caucasus. The highest elevation is 2,661 metres. The 13-km-long massif is composed of Lower Cretaceous and Upper Jurassic limestones that dip continuously southwest to the Black Sea and plunge below the modern sea level. The area is densely wooded, with large areas of both coniferous forest and mixed woodland. The Arbaika contains a number of remarkable caves, gorges, wells, and precipices, including the Veryovkina Cave and Voronya Cave, the world's deepest caves."
