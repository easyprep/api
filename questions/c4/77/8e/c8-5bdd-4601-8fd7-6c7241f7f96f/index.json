  "question": "Which city is hosting the Informal World Trade Organisation (WTO) ministerial meeting?",
  "option1": "Mysuru",
  "option2": "Lucknow",
  "option3": "New Delhi",
  "option4": "Bhopal",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "New Delhi",
  "explanation": "The two-day Informal World Trade Organisation (WTO) ministerial meeting has started in New Delhi on March 19, 2018. Representatives from 50 countries are participating in the meet. The informal meeting is expected to provide an opportunity to engage in free and frank discussions leading to political guidance on some of the major issues, both at the negotiating table and also in other areas. In the absence of Ministerial guidance at the 11th Ministerial Conference that took place in December 2017 in Buenos Aires, it is hoped that the meeting in New Delhi will provide an opportunity for ministers to explore in greater detail options on different issues for re-invigorating the WTO."
