  "answer": "France",
  "explanation": "The Sainte-Chapelle is a royal chapel in the Gothic style, within the medieval Palais de la Cite, the residence of the Kings of France until the 14th century, located on the banks of the River Seine in Paris, France. Construction began sometime after 1238 and the chapel was consecrated on 26 April 1248. The Sainte-Chapelle is considered among the highest achievements of the Rayonnant period of Gothic architecture. It was commissioned by King Louis IX of France to house his collection of Passion Relics, including Christ's Crown of Thorns â€“ one of the most important relics in medieval Christendom, later hosted in the nearby Notre-Dame Cathedral until the 2019 fire, which it survived. Along with the Conciergerie, the Sainte-Chapelle is one of the earliest surviving buildings of the Capetian royal palace on the Ile de la Cite. Although damaged during the French Revolution and restored in the 19th century, it has one of the most extensive 13th-century stained glass collections anywhere in the world."
