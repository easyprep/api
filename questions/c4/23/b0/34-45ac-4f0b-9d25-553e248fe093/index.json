  "explanation": "The Cibao Valley is the most densely settled region of the island country of the Dominican Republic in the Hispaniola Islands of the Greater Antilles Archipelago in the West Indies-Caribbean region. It is also known as Valle Del Cibao in Spanish. This valley extends from Manzanillo Bay in the west to the Samana Bay in the east in the northern Dominican Republic. This valley is bordered by Cordillera Septentrional to the north and Cordillera Central to the south. The Yaque del Norte river drains the west of the valley which gives it savanna vegetation and patches of low, thorny bushes. The Yuna river drains the east of the valley which forms the humid, fertile La Vega Real region. European colonization of the Dominican Republic began in the Cibao Valley in 1494 and chief crops are wheat, rice, coffee, tobacco, corn etc."
