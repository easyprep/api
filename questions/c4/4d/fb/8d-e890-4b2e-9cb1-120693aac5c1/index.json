  "question": "The Organic fertilizers are better than Chemical Fertilizers because __:<br> 1.While Chemical fertilizers kill the micro-organisms in the soil, Organic fertilizers boost microbial activity<br> 2.While overuse of Chemical fertilizers is disastrous for soil, overuse of organic fertilizers is somewhat beneficial to soil productivity<br> 3.Organic fertilizers take less time to release the nutrients into soil, in comparison to Chemical fertilizers<br> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3 are correct",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "Chemical fertilizers kill the micro-organisms in the soil. It is one of the advantages of organic fertilizers that they boost microbial activity in the soil. These microbes help in degenerating the complex compounds present in the organic fertilizers. Overuse of fertilizers is often a problem as excess nutrients are neither good for the overall composition of soil nor are they good for the plant. Organic fertilizers would also have a problem of overuse, but it is a slow nutrient releasing material, so the nutrients will anyway take some time to get absorbed. The statement mentioned in the question stands incorrect. Organic fertilizers may take more time to release the nutrients as they need some microbial activity to get them working. Chemical fertilizers get cracking instantly and release the essential nutrients into the soil. So statement 3 also stands incorrect."
