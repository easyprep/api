  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "Only 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "<p class=\\\"Notes\\\">The first statement is incorrect because the single citizenship would provide unitary features to the constitution. Rest of the statements are correct. The single citizenship also reflects the social and political conditions created at that time by partition. During communal riots, large number of Hindus and Muslims migrated to and fro Pakistan. At that time, it was necessary to respond to situation created by lots of refugees. At the same time, many people who lived aborad applied for Indian Citizenship because now they had decided to live in newly freed country. All these factors had made the matter of citizenship very complicated."
