  "question": "Buluthi Nellu, a near-extinct rice variant, is predominantly grown in which state?",
  "option1": "Tamil Nadu",
  "option2": "Andhra Pradesh",
  "option3": "Kerala",
  "option4": "Telangana",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Kerala",
  "explanation": "Buluthi Nellu, a rice variety, belongs exclusively to Attappady and is presently available with very few tribal farmers in Sholayur panchayat. It is now a near extinct rice variant because of large-scale land alienation and adverse climatic conditions, which forced the tribal people in Attappady to stop cultivating both upland and low land rice varieties."
