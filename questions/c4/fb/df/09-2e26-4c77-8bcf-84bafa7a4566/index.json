  "question": "India’s defence sector has been gaining attention for its increasing exports. Consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>India is the biggest importer of defence equipment.</li>\n<li>The new “Open General Export Licence” will allow only public sector to export defence equipment.</li>\n<li>Friendly countries can buy Indian manufactured Offshore Patrol Vehicles for the same price as the Indian Army.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 and 2",
  "option2": "None of the above",
  "option3": "3 only",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "3 only",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nIndia is the second largest importer of defence equipment. The largest buyer of such equipment is the Saudi Arabia. Saudi accounts for 12% of the imports while India, now, accounts for about 9%. India is increasingly showing a shift towards the export side. From 2016-17, the exports have more than doubled to the current value of about 11,000 crore INR.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe “Open General Export Licence” concept is a part of India’s new Defence Export Policy. It encourages both public and private players to export defence components (of certain categories) to identified nations. This blanket permission on select item will give Indian manufacturers access to the global market. The concept is looking to shift the focus from small component manufacturing to value addition on larger platforms.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nLending of lines of credit is one of the modes that India uses to increase its defence exports. These are soft loans wherein the receiving country can buy equipment worth upto the amount specified in the loan. By this mode, friendly countries can buy equipment like the Offshore Patrol Vehicles for the same price as Indian army buys it."
