  "option1": "1, 3 and 4",
  "option2": "1, 2 and 3",
  "option3": "1, 2 and 4",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 3 and 4",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nCombatant roles are not allocated to women in combat specialist forces in India. Special Forces are those that are under the direct command of the Indian Army and are used for special operations, such as Operation Cactus in Maldives. They are however employed as trainers. Eg: Dr. Seema Rao, a pioneer in close quarter combat, has trained over 15,000 personnel for the Indian Special Forces.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nIndian Air Force allows appointment of women in all roles- support and also combat roles. The air force had 13% of women personnel in 2018. This is the highest among all three forces. They have also participated in the Kargil conflict.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nNavy represents the next highest employer of women among the armed forces of India. The navy is looking to setup separate facilities for women aboard warships that are to be constructed in the future. The unavailability of such facilities is the leading reason for their limited employment.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is correct:\nThe CRPF, in collaboration with the DRDO, has unveiled the first women specific body armour in the country. This will enable greater comfort and mobility for the personnel. This gender specific protective gear weighs 6kg and was developed after 2 years’ research by DIPAS/ Defence Institute of Physiology and Applied Sciences- a part of DRDO."
