  "question": "In context of the UNCCD report highlighting the role of indigenous people in forest conservation, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Indigenous people protect and manage forests with a greater efficiency than governments according to the report.</li>\n<li>The report says that forestry is a male dominated sector.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",

  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe UNCCD has released the report titled, ‘Forest and Trees: At the heart of land degradation neutrality’. In it, the body notes that the indigenous people do a better job at managing forests than several governments spending billions for the same purpose. The indigenous people are reported to be the custodians of about 40% of protected landscape and manage 300 billion tonnes of carbon on land.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe report highlights the role of women in forest conservation. It says that women’s traditional knowledge and management practices play an important role in forest management. Yet, the sector remains male dominated. The report advocates benefit sharing and access for women on par with men.\n&nbsp;"
