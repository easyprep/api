  "explanation": "Former Indian Badminton player Pullela Gopichand initiated India's largest 'train the trainers' programme by inducting 1500 Physical Education (PE) teachers from across Gujarat for advanced training. This programme has been envisioned by the ELMS Sports Foundation. ELMS Sports Foundation is a not-for-profit initiative promoted by Vita and Jalaj Dani and mentored by Pullela Gopichand and Olympic gold medallist, shooter Abhinav Bindra. Aim of this programme is to develop the skills of PE teachers so that they can impart the right techniques to children aspiring to make a career in sports. Under this programme, Gopichand along with a team of experts will first select 150 PE teachers (out of 1500 inducted PE teachers) to become master trainers. The selected 150 PE teachers will attend a week-long workshop in which they will be familiarised with modern sports techniques. Thereafter, these teachers will impart the same to the other teachers across the state.",
