  "question": "&nbsp; &nbsp;Consider the following pairs: <ol> <li>Sublimation -  Solid to the gas phase&nbsp;</li> <li>Ablation -  Removal of material from the surface of an object</li> <li>Deposition -  Gas changes directly into a solid</li> </ol> &nbsp; &nbsp; Which of the above is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "3 Only",
  "option3": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Removal of material from the surface of an object by&nbsp;vaporization is called ablation. When gas changes directly to solid without first becoming liquid is called Deposition. It is also known as desublimation. It is a thermodynamic process."
