  "question": "Which of these pairs has the same unit of measurement?",
  "option1": "Rate of flow and Acceleration",
  "option2": "Impulse and Moment of Force",
  "option3": "Rydberg constant and Gas constant",
  "option4": "Pressure and Coefficient of Elasticity",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Pressure and Coefficient of Elasticity",
  "explanation": "Pressure and Coefficient of Elasticity have the same unit i.e. N m<sup>-2</sup> (Newton per metre square) Other important units: Rate of Flow: m<sup>3</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> Acceleration: ms<sup>-2</sup> Rydberg constant: 1/m Gas constant: J/K Impulse: Ns Moment of Force: Nm"
