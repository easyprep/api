  "question": "In light of recent research showing the occurrence of the Golden ration in the human skull, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>This ratio is obtained by dividing a line into two unequal segments and the ratio between these two segments is the same as the ratio between the entire line and the shorter segment.</li>\n<li>Golden ratio is a rational number.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nGolden ratio is obtained when a straight line is divided into two segments that are unequal to each other. The ratio obtained by dividing the longer segment by the shorter segment must be equal to the ratio between the entire line and the longer of the two segments. In such a case, the line is divided in a golden ratio.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe golden ratio is an irrational number. This is because the numbers after the decimal point go on forever i.e., 1.61803â€¦ the ratio had been discovered recently in the dimensions of human skull. The researchers found that when an arc is drawn on the skull and divided at a key junction, the 2 segments are in golden ratio."
