  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Neither Babur nor Humayun lived long enough to enjoy the newly founded Mughal Empire. The reign of Akbar (1556-1605) witnessed the development of the mughal architecture. The most important features of the Mughal monuments in India are the bulbous domes with constricted necks, the slender minarets with cupolas at the four corners, large halls, massive vaulted gateways and delicate ornamentation. Red Sandstone was amply used in Mughal monuments.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The largest difference from other regions of Islamic art from the Mughal Art is that the Mughals produced many masterpieces in mausoleums than in mosques.</li>\r\n<li>The Mughal art was essentially Persian in character in the beginning. Once defeated by Shershah, Humayun had fled to Safavidâ€™s Persia for 15 years and then returned to Delhi in 1555, bringing a large number of Persian architects and painters with him, greatly contributing to Mughal art afterward, encouraging its Persian character.</li>\r\n</ul>"
