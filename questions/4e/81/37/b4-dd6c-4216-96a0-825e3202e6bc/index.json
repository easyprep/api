  "question": "With reference to the office of Governor in India, consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The governor has no security of tenure and no fixed term of office.</li>\r\n<li>The report of Governor becomes the basis of imposing emergency in a state under article 356</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above is / are true statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct. Article 156 says that the governor will hold office during the pleasure of the President for five years. President works on aid and advice of the Council of Ministers under Article 74. In effect it is the central government that appoints and removes the Governors. The governor has no security of tenure and no fixed term of office. Thus, relationship between centre and governor of state usually turn sour when the person holding the office of governor is not from ruling dispensation at the centre. Second statement is also correct. The report of Governor becomes the basis of imposing emergency in a state under article 356. So, the ruling party at centre would like to appoint as many as possible persons of its own party as governors of states."
