  "question": "&nbsp; Consider the following statements about the Scramjet Engines: <ol> <li>These use atmospheric oxygen to burn the fuel</li> <li>These engines are highly inefficient at low speeds, while their efficiency increases at supersonic speeds</li> </ol> &nbsp; Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Both are correct statements<br> Scramjet Engines use atmospheric oxygen to burn the fuel. The most important feature of this engine is that it is highly inefficient at low speeds, while their efficiency increases at supersonic speeds. ISRO&rsquo;s reusable launch vehicle platform, called Avatar,&nbsp;and supersonic Brahmos-II missile, would be using this scramjet technology. &nbsp;"
