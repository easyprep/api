  "question": "Why a small liquid drop is in spherical shape?",
  "option1": "due to surface tension",
  "option2": "due to low viscosity",
  "option3": "due to hydrogen bonding",
  "option4": "due to low density",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "due to surface tension",
  "explanation": "For a given volume, the sphere has minimum surface area. A small liquid drop has spherical shape as due to surface tension the liquid surface tries to have minimum surface area."
