  "question": "&nbsp;Consider the following statements about the ASTROSAT: <ol> <li>It is India&rsquo;s first astronomy observatory to study distant celestial objects&nbsp;</li> <li>It aims to search for black hole sources in the galaxy</li> </ol> &nbsp; Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Both are correct statements<br> ASTROSAT aims at understanding the high energy processes in binary star systems containing neutron stars and black holes. It also aims to: <ul> <li>Understand high-energy processes in binary systems</li> <li>Search for black hole sources in the galaxy</li> <li>Measure magnetic fields of neutron stars</li> <li>Study high-energy processes in extra-galactic systems</li> <li>Detect new transient X-ray sources</li> <li>Perform limited high angular-resolution deep field survey in UV</li> </ul> &nbsp;"
