  "question": "Electron microscope works on which of the following principles?",
  "option1": "Optical interference",
  "option2": "Wave Nature of electrons",
  "option3": "Motion of charged particle in electromagnetic fields",
  "option4": "Faraday's law of Electromagnetic induction",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Wave Nature of electrons",
  "explanation": "Electron microscope works on the principle of Wave Nature of electrons. Electron microscopes use an electron beam instead of visible light and an electron detector instead of our eyes. An electron beam allows us to see at very small scales because electrons can also behave as light due to its wave nature."
