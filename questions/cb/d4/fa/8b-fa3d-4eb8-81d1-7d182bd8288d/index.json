  "question": "India made a pitch to enter the Nuclear Suppliers Group at the Bloomberg Global Business Forum. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The guidelines of the NSG are binding in nature.</li>\n<li>India is not signatory to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.</li>\n<li>None of the non-NPT countries are members of the NSG.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe NSG was constituted as an informal group in 1974 in response to Indiaâ€™s nuclear test that year. Its guidelines are non-binding. It is an export control regime aimed at bringing in export of nuclear equipment and technology under regulation.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nIndia is not signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This is the reason used by China and several other countries like Austria and New Zealand to block its entry into the NSG. The NPT is an international agreement to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons use.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nCurrently, the NSG has 48 participant states. All of these states are signatory to the NPT. Several states like China and NZ has called for mandating ratification of NPT as a pre-requisite for entry into the NSG. Some countries -India, Israel, Pakistan and South Sudan are non-NPT states.\n&nbsp;"
