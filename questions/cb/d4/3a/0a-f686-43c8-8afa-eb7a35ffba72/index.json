  "explanation": "Leila Locke was a Guyanese artist. Born in England, she lived in Georgetown, Guyana, from 1958 until her death, taking out Guyanese citizenship in the early 1970s. Artist and anthropologist Denis Williams described Leila Locke as being among those artists who created a vision of Guyana: \"They laid the foundation to what I have called critically the Guyana School of Art which constituted a body of artists struggling to find a form of art out of the given circumstances of their environment. Leila Locke contributed to that movement in that she brought her English outlook to bear on our intimate backyards, our houses, our jalousies. She was intrigued by the geography of our landscape and gave us a brilliant view of ourselves through our work.\"",
