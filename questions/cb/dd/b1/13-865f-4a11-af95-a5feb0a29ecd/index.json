  "question": "Consider the following comparisons of convergent and divergent plate boundaries:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Convergent plate boundaries produce more explosive volcanoes in comparison to divergent plate boundaries</li>\r\n<li>Convergent plate boundaries produce more dangerous earthquakes in comparison to divergent plate boundaries</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "<strong>Convergent Boundaries</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explosive Volcanoes</li>\r\n<li>High Silicic Magma: The magma comes from the subduction of lithospheric crust so it has more of silicate.</li>\r\n<li>Stratovolcanoes</li>\r\n<li>Consumption of the Ocean Floor</li>\r\n<li>Shallow, Intermediate as well as Deep Focus Earthquakes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Divergent Boundaries</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Quite, Non explosive volcanoes</li>\r\n<li>High Basaltic Magma: Oceanic crust is created at the mid-oceanic ridges; it forms from up welling magma that cools and solidifies to igneous rock.</li>\r\n<li>Most of this is Basaltic.</li>\r\n<li>Shield Volcanoes</li>\r\n<li>Creation of Ocean Floor</li>\r\n<li>Shallow Focus earthquakes only</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn the above question, the second statement is not correct, because any of them can produce dangerous earthquakes"
