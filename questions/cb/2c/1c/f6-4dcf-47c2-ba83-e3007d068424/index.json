  "question": "Which of the following situations created by trees makes them unsuitable to sleep under at night?",
  "option1": "Release of oxygen in lesser amount",
  "option2": "Release of oxygen in larger amount",
  "option3": "Release of carbon monoxide",
  "option4": "Release of carbon dioxide",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Release of carbon dioxide",
  "explanation": "The plants leave carbon dioxide at night. On the basis of this it is that in the night if you sleep under the tree, you will not get oxygen, which can cause breathing problem, suffocation etc.  Also in the night there is no photosynthesis due to the absence of sunlight but respiration goes on in the plant cells. Therefore there is lot of carbon dioxide and less of oxygen around the tree in the night."
