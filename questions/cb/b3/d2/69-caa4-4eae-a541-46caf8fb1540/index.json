  "question": "Consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>No cut motion can be moved on charged expenditures</li>\r\n<li>A cut motion is allowed only if it is related to only one demand</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above is / are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The Cut Motions are mostly defeated due to Number strength of the ruling party or coalition. As the cut motion is a veto power given to the member of the Lok Sabha to oppose a demand in the financial bill discussed by the government, it is seen as an effective tool to test the strength of the government. If a cut motion is adopted by the House and the government does not have the numbers, it is obliged to resign. The cut motion can be admitted to the house only if it is related to only one demand and not many. No cut motion can be moved on charged expenditures. The cut motions are important because they facilitate the constructive discussion on each demand and uphold the principle of democratic government, by giving the members power to veto the demands."
