  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Okavango River is the fourth longest river in southern Africa. The longest river is Nile in Egypt. The river and its associated basin and national parks are under threat from the mines in the region. These mines were from the Civil War periods.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe river is endorheic i.e, it does not drain into the ocean. The river commences in Angola and terminates in the Kalahari Desert. At its end, it forms a swamp called the Okavango Alluvial Fan. It also flows through Namibia and Botswana."
