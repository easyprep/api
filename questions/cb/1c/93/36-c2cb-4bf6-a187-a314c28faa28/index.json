  "question": "The National Mission for the Development of Ultra Supercritical Technology is associated with which of the following?",
  "option1": "Thermal power plants",
  "option2": "Solar Power plants",
  "option3": "Nuclear power plants",
  "option4": "Liquid biofuel power plants",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Thermal power plants",
  "explanation": "Recently, the central government announced a National Mission on advanced ultra supercritical technologies for cleaner coal utilisation at a total cost of US $ 238 million. Under the mission, the government plans to set-up two Centres of Excellence on Clean Coal Technologies at US $5 million each. <strong>What is Advanced Ultra-Supercritical (AUSC) Technology?</strong> The pulverised coal power plants are divided into four categories based on operating temperature, pressure and efficiency of steam cycle. <em>First</em> is subcritical pulverised coal power plant that operates with critical temperature and critical pressure of water below 540 degree and 170-220 bars and has operating efficiency below 38%. <em>Second</em> is supercritical pulverised coal plant that operates with critical temperature and critical pressure above 615 degree and 250 bars and reaches efficiency upto 42%. <em>Third</em> is ultra-supercritical pulverised coal plant that operates with critical temperature and critical pressure of water above 620 degree and 330 bars and reaches efficiency in the range of 42% to 46 %. <em>Fourth</em> is advanced ultra-supercritical pulverised coal technology that operates with critical temperature and critical pressure of water in range of 700-760 degrees and 350 bars and targets operating efficiency greater than 50%."
