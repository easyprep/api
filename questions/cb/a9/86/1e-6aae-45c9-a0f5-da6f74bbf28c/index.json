  "question": "The Gill Oxygen Limitation Theory has been in news recently. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The theory explains the effects of climate change on fish distribution.</li>\n<li>The theory predicts that fishes will increasingly move towards the polar region.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Gill Oxygen Limitation Theory was put forth to explain the changes in distribution of fish population across the world oceans. The theory explains the effect of climate change on fish distribution. It uses the biological mechanisms to explain why fishes will become more deprived of oxygen due to climate change in the tropical region.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:        </strong>\nAccording to the theory, fishes will increasingly shift towards the polar region. This is because warmer water will hold lesser dissolved oxygen, implying meagre availability of oxygen for the fishes. Also, warmer waters will speed up their metabolism, which in turn will increase their oxygen requirement."
