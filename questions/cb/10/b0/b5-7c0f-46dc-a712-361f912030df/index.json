  "question": "With reference to the ongoing review of the central financing of the states’ spending of the funds allotted for forests at the UNCCD, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The forest conservation fund allocated by the 14<sup>th</sup> Finance Commission to the states is a ‘tied fund’.</li>\n<li>Brazil’s ICMS Ecologio is an ‘ecological sales tax’.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nTied fund is a fund the spending (by the state) of which is monitored by the centre. The earlier funds allotted by the 12<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> FCs were tied funds. However, the 14<sup>th</sup> FC allotted untied funds to the state. This implies that the state may/ may not spend the funds for forest conservation.\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nBrazil’s ICMS Ecologio is an ecological sales tax. It compensates municipal government for the lost potential tax revenue from designation of land as ‘protected area’. The compensation from the state or federal government has enabled the increase in protected area by 160% in the South American country."
