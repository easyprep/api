  "question": "&nbsp; &nbsp;Consider the following statements about Troposphere: <ol> <li>Temperature decreases with increase in height in troposphere</li> <li>Thickness of troposphere is greater at equator than at poles</li> </ol> &nbsp; &nbsp;Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct. Second statement is also correct because the troposphere is thicker at equator than that at poles. Regions near&nbsp;equator&nbsp;receive&nbsp;more&nbsp;sunlight&nbsp;than&nbsp;the&nbsp;poles&nbsp;making them hotter than poles. The air at equator gets heated up and rises higher being less dense than at equator."
