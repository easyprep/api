  "question": "With regards to the recent discovery of <em>Natrialba swarupiae</em>, consider the following statements about archaea:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>These are a type of bacteria.</li>\n<li>They can exist in the human body.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nArchaea is not a bacterial group. They are single celled organisms that are classified as prokaryotes i.e. they lack membrane bound nuclei and membrane bound cell organelles. The recently discovered Natrialba swarupiae is an archaea discovered in Sambhar Lake.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe archaea can live in human systems- especially in the gastrointestinal tract. They are noted for living in extreme environments like hypersaline lakes, hot springs, deserts, etc. However, they are slow growing and difficult to culture in laboratory conditions."
