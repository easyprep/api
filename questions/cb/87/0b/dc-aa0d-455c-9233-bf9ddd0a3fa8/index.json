  "question": "The scientists at which central research institute have developed Indiaâ€™s first indigenous anti-nuclear medical kit?",
  "option1": "Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences",
  "option2": "Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics",
  "option3": "Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany",
  "option4": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences",
  "explanation": "The scientist at INMAS claim to have developed India\\'s first indigenous medical kit that may ensure protection from serious injuries and faster healing of wounds resulting from nuclear warfare or radioactive leakage. The medical kit has been developed for the armed, paramilitary and police forces only as they are the first ones likely to get exposed to radiation. It has over 25 items, including radio-protectors that provide 80-90% protection against radiation and nerve gas agents, bandages that absorb radiation as well as tablets and ointments.  The kit also has an Ethylene Di-amine Tetra acetic acid (EDTA) injection that traps uranium in the guts and blood of victims during a nuclear accident or warfare. The kit also has Ca-EDTA Respiratory Fluid, which is the inhalation formula for chelation, or grabbing, of heavy metals and radioactive elements deposited in lungs through inhalation at nuclear accident sites. The medicine reduces the body burden of radioactivity by 30-40% in controlled conditions and is highly useful for the rescue teams and victims after a nuclear accident. The acronym \\\"INMAS\\\" stands for \\\"Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences\\\"."
