  "question": "Which among the following is / are consequences, when an aquatic ecosystem such as a lake experiences an increase in nutrients?<br> 1. The Population of most species of fish will increase<br> 2. The Biological Oxygen Demand of the lake water would decrease<br> 3. The biomass of phytoplankton will increase<br> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 3",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "<table width=\"100%\"> <tbody> <tr> <td width=\"100%\"><strong>Ecological Impacts of Eutrophication:</strong> § Increased biomass of phytoplankton, This increases Biological Oxygen Demand § Toxic or inedible phytoplankton species § Increases in blooms of gelatinous zooplankton § Increased biomass of benthic and epiphytic algae § Changes in macrophyte species composition and biomass § Decreases in water transparency (increased turbidity) § Colour, smell, and water treatment problems § Dissolved oxygen depletion, this leads to increase in Biological Oxygen Demand § Increased incidences of fish kills § Loss of desirable fish species § Reductions in harvestable fish and shellfish § Decreases in perceived aesthetic value of the water body</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>"
