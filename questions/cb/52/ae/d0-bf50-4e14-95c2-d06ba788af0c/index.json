  "question": "In light of the recent discussions about the disposal of ‘enemy property’, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Movable property cannot be termed as ‘enemy property’.</li>\n<li>A citizen of India cannot be considered as ‘enemy subject’ under the 2017 Enemy Property Act.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nAny property left behind in India by a citizen of countries like China or Pakistan during the wars is considered an enemy property. These properties can either be movable or immovable structures. These are vested in the Custodian of Enemy Property for India.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe 2017 Enemy Property Act was an amendment of the 1968 act that governed the management of enemy properties in India. It expanded the term ‘enemy subject’ to include the legal successor of the enemy to the property, irrespective of citizenship. This means that a citizen of India who is the legal heir to the enemy property is also considered as ‘enemy subject’."
