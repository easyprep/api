  "question": "A and B together can do a work in 10 days. B and C together can do the work in 6 days. A and C together can do the work in 12 days. Then A, B and C together can do the work in :",
  "option1": "14 days",
  "option2": "28 days",
  "option3": "$latex 5\\frac{5}{7}days&s=1$",
  "option4": "$latex 8\\frac{2}{7}days&s=1$",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "$latex 5\\frac{5}{7}days&s=1$",
  "explanation": "(A + B)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex =\\\\frac{1}{10}&s=1$\r\n(B + C)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex =\\\\frac{1}{6}&s=1$\r\n(C + A)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex =\\\\frac{1}{12}&s=1$\r\nOn adding all above equations, \r\n2 (A + B + C)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex =\\\\frac{1}{10}+\\\\frac{1}{6}+\\\\frac{1}{12}= \\\\frac{6+10+5}{60}&s=1$\r\n$latex =\\\\frac{21}{60}=\\\\frac{7}{20}&s=1$\r\n∴ (A + B + C)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex =\\\\frac{7}{40}&s=1$\r\n∴ All three together will complete the work in $latex \\\\frac{40}{7} = 5\\\\frac{5}{7}&s=1$\r\nHence option [C] is correct answer."
