  "answer": "Russia",
  "explanation": "The Red Army invasion of Georgia (15 February – 17 March 1921), also known as the Soviet–Georgian War or the Soviet invasion of Georgia, which forms part of the Russian Civil War and Turkish War of Independence, was a military campaign by the Russian Red Army aimed at overthrowing the Social-Democratic government of the Democratic Republic of Georgia and installing a Bolshevik regime in the country. The conflict was a result of an expansionist policy by the Russians, who aimed to control as much as possible of the lands which had been part of the former Russian Empire until the turbulent events of the First World War, as well as the revolutionary efforts of mostly Russian-based Georgian Bolsheviks, who did not have sufficient support in their native country to seize power without external intervention."
