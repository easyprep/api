  "question": "&nbsp; &nbsp; Consider the following statements: <ol> <li>Majority of rivers in India have open basin</li> <li>Majority of rivers in India drain in Bay of Bengal</li> </ol> &nbsp; &nbsp; Which among the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Almost all of India&rsquo;s rivers are of open basin as more than 90% of total surface water runoff would go to Bay of Bengal. Rest goes to Arabian Sea. There is just a small area in parts of Ladakh, northern parts of the &nbsp;Aravalli range and the arid parts of the Thar Desert, that have inland drainage."
