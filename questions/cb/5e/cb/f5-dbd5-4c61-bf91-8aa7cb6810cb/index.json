  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nBandar Abbas is a port in Iran. It is located along the countryâ€™s southern coast and serves as its main naval base. The tanker had been held off the port by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards for over two months for allegedly failing to respond to its calls.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nBandar Abbas is located in the Persian Gulf. It enjoys a strategic position on the Gulf of Hormuz. The incident is a part of a series of events causing increasing tensions in the Hormuz region. The seizure was seen as a response to the British activity against an Iranian tanker in Gibraltar."
