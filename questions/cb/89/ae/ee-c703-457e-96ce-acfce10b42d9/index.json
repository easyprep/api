  "question": "Consider the following pairs of committees with tasks to which they are associated: <ol> <li>Gulshan Rai committee - Cyber Security</li> <li>Saumitra Chaudhuri Committee - Auto Fuel Vision &amp; Policy 2025</li> <li>Ramesh Chand Committee - Computation of Minimum Support Price (MSP)</li> </ol> Which of the above is/are correct?",

  "option2": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The Ramesh Chand Committee Report of March 2015 said the Minimum Support Price (MSP) should be calculated by computing farm labour at the skilled wage rate, calculating land rent at the actual rent without any ceiling, calculating interest on working capital by including a factor relating to borrowing from non-institutional sources, calculating interest on working capital for the whole and not half the crop season, by including in the cost of cultivation post-harvest costs and by including the rate of inflation. If this is done, the MSP would rise by over 50 per cent. The five-member committee headed by the Dr. Gulshan Rai, National Cyber Security Coordinator made its recommendations on measures required to control cyber crime including legal and technical measures.  An expert Committee under the Chairmanship of Shri Soumitra Choudhuri, Member of Planning Commission recommended road map for auto fuel quality till 2025 for the country, taking into account the achievement under the last Auto Fuel Policy, emission reduction of in-use vehicles, growth of vehicles and supply and availability of fuels."
