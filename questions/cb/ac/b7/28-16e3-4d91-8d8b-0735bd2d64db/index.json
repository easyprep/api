  "answer": "Rwanda",
  "explanation": "Rwanda has become the first low-income country in the world to provide universal eye care for its 12 million citizens. Rwanda government has partnered with Vision for a Nation (VFAN), a UK-based charity organization, to train 3,000 eye care nurses in 502 local health centres. They would prescribe glasses to patients and direct them to national clinics in case of serious eye problems. The most common eye problem in Rwanda is short sightedness. Coffee bean sorting is one of the major means of income for Rwanda women. Their eye sight deteriorates as they reach 45 years, and hence their livelihood and means of income are affected.",
