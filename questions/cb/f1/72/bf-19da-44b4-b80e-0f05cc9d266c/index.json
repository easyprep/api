  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "PAVA is \"biosafe\" better than chilli grenade or tear smoke shell. It was recently in news when in order to tackle stone pelting in Kashmir, Indian Border Security Force (BSF) decided to use a new type of bomb containing world&rsquo;s hottest chilli powder, instead of explosives. These bombs are being produced in Gwalior city of Madhya Pradesh. The initiative has been taken to reduce injuries. It was first made by India&rsquo;s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).  The name PAVA stands for Pelargonic Acid Vanillyl Amide, also called Nonivamide, and is an organic compound found characteristically in natural chilli pepper."
