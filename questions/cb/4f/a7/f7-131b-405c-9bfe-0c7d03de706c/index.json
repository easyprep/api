  "option1": "India",
  "option2": "China",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "China",
  "explanation": "An official data from China revealed that the country’s birth rate fell to the lowest, since 1949, the year in which the People’s Republic of China was founded seven decades ago. According to the data, the birth rate was 10.94 per thousand, which was lesser than the previous birth rate of 12.43 per thousand, in 2017. \r\nAs China has a rapidly growing aging population, it allowed urban couples to give birth to two children, against the one-child policy which was in effect. As per another recent study, India will overtake China in population in 2027."
