  "question": "The ancient city \"Prayaga\" was renamed as “Allahabad” by which Mughal emperor?",
  "option1": "Akbar",
  "option2": "Aurangzeb",
  "option3": "Humayun",
  "option4": "Shah Jahan",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Shah Jahan",
  "explanation": "Recently, the Uttar Pradesh Cabinet has officially adopted a proposal to rename the historic city of Allahabad as Prayagraj. The city was known as Prayag before 16th-century Mughal emperor Akbar built a fort near the confluence of the Ganga and the Yamuna and named it “Ilahabad”. His grandson Shah Jahan renamed the entire city “Allahabad”. An area near the confluence of the river continues to be known as Prayag. The confluence of two rivers is a ‘prayag’, and in Allahabad three rivers Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati meet. Hence, it is the king of ‘prayags’. That is why it is ‘Prayagraj’. Now, the proposal will now go to the Centre before the city is officially renamed even though an Uttar Pradesh minister seemed to suggest the change has already come into effect."
