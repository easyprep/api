  "question": "There are two pumps to fill a tank with water. First pump can fill the empty tank in 8 hours, while the second in 10 hours, If both the pumps are opened at the same time and kept open for 4 hours, the part of the tank that will be filled up is :",
  "option1": "$latex \\frac{2}{5}&s=1$",
  "option2": "$latex \\frac{1}{5}&s=1$",
  "option3": "$latex \\frac{9}{10}&s=1$",
  "option4": "$latex \\frac{1}{10}&s=1$",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "$latex \\frac{9}{10}&s=1$",
  "explanation": "Part of the tank filled in an hour by both pumps\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{1}{8}+\\\\frac{1}{10} = \\\\frac{5+4}{40} = \\\\frac{9}{40}&s=1$\r\nâˆ´ Part of the tank filled in 4 hours\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{4\\\\times 9}{40} = \\\\frac{9}{10}&s=1$\r\nHence option [C] is correct answer."
