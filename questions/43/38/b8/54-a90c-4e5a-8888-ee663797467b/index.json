  "question": "Which of these alkanes has higher boiling point?",
  "option1": "Butane",
  "option2": "Methane",
  "option3": "Ethane",
  "option4": "Hexane",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Hexane",
  "explanation": "There is a steady increase in boiling point with the increase in molecular mass. This is due to the fact that the intermolecular van der Waals forces increase with increase of the molecular size or the surface area of the molecule."
