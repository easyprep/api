  "question": "With reference to the ‘E-commerce: Changing Competition Landscape in India’ workshop and the study on Indian e-commerce by Competition Committee of India, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Online food ordering platforms with their own cloud kitchen may affect platform neutrality according to the report.</li>\r\n<li>Deep discounting is an issue being studied by the CCI.</li>\r\n<li>This is the first study of its kind.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "All are incorrect",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe CCI study presented its interim observations during the e-commerce workshop. Platform neutrality was one of the concepts highlighted by the body. The e-commerce platforms are alleged (by stakeholders) to be biased towards certain sellers over others while advertising and thus contributing an obstacle to fair competition. This is especially so when the platform has its own cloud kitchen (kitchens without dine-in facility but provides food delivery).\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe CCI study is also looking into deep discounting. It is the practice of offering goods and service at a price far below the market price. This constitutes an unfair trade practice and affects healthy competition. The observations and suggestions from this study will guide the framing of future policies governing e-commerce in India.\r\n<strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe ongoing CCI study is the 20<sup>th</sup> in a series of market studies conducted by the fair trade watchdog. It uses a combination of market studies, desk research and stakeholders consultation. It uses a questionnaire to obtain data from the e-commerce players. The study will follow trends in business practices, models, distribution mechanisms, etc."
