  "option4": "Raising",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Pumping",
  "explanation": "A collection of atoms or molecules that can be excited to a higher energy state is called an active medium. Before lasing can occur, the active media is \"pumped\". The process of raising the atoms in the active media from a lower energy state to a higher state is like pumping water up from a well.",
