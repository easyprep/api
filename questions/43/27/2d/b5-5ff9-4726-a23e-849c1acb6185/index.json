  "question": "Consider the following statements about Democracy Index: <ol> <li>It is an index compiled by International Democrat Union (IDU)</li> <li>It measures the countries democratic score on a scale from 0 to 100</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because the Democracy Index is compiled by a UK based company the Economist Intelligence Unit. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u> because the index measures the democratic score on a scale from 0 to 100. The index ranks 165 independent states and 2 territories on basis of 60 indicators grouped in five different categories viz. electoral process and pluralism, civil liberties, the functioning of government, political participation and political culture. It categories countries into four broad categories viz. full democracy, flawed democracy, hybrid regime and authoritarian regime based on their score on a scale from 0 to 10."
