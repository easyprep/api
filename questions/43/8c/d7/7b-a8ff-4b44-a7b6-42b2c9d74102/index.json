  "explanation": "There are six official languages of the UN viz. Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish. Portuguese and Hindi are not the official languages of United Nations. Recently, external affairs minister Sushma Swarajâ€™s pushed for making Hindi an official language at the United Nations. To make Hindi an official language in United Nations, it will require a two-third majority vote in support in United Nation General Assembly. Also, India will have to bear an additional annual cost of 400 crore, as reported."
