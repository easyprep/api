  "question": "With reference to the election of the President of India, consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>All doubts and disputes in connection with election of the President are inquired into and decided by the Supreme Court</li>\r\n<li>2 In the presidential elections, every voter has plural votes</li>\r\n<li>Members of both houses of state legislature participate in voting</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The first statement is correct. All doubts and disputes in connection with election of the President are inquired into and decided by the Supreme Court whose decision is final. In context with presidential elections we use the term Proportional representation. However, it seems to be a misnomer because proportional representation is used where two or more seats are to be filled. At the same time, single transferable vote also seems a misnomer because in Presidential elections, no voter as single vote and all voters have plural votes. The third statement is incorrect."
