  "question": "In context with the recent cabinet approval for Patent Prosecution Highway Program, consider the following statements about its pilot project with Japanese Patent Office:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Getting a technology patented in Japan will automatically get it approved in India.</li>\n<li>Both Indian and Japanese patent offices will receive patent applications from all fields under this program.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Patent Prosecution Highway Program was approved by the cabinet in November. A pilot project has been set up to function between the Indian and Japanese patent offices. Under this scheme, getting a technology patented in one country will put it on a fast-track in the other. However, it will not guarantee a patent.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Indian Patent Office will receive patent applications only in certain fields under this program: automobile, textiles, electrical, Electronics, Computer Science, Information Technology, Physics, Civil, Mechanical and metallurgy related applications. The Japanese counterpart, however, will receive applications from all fields."
