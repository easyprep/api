  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "All the statements are correct in above question. The majority of bangles were handmade of terra-cotta: These were probably for everyday wear, like the ubiquitous glass bangles worn today. Some were plain, others decorated with painted or incised designs. Shell bangles were also widespread. Other bangles were made of a copper or bronze rod. Bead making was a prominent industry. Beads played an important role in dress, and this is confirmed by figurines, which are often shown dressed in little else. Regarding clothing, the Harappans wore clothes of cotton, leather, and probably wool."
