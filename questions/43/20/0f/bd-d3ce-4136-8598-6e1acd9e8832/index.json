This newly launched clinic will be the nodal point for leading research in clinical ecotoxicology in the country. It will provide diagnostic consultation & research services to all the clinical departments dealing with diseases due to ecotoxicity. The patients visiting OPDs will be referred to the clinic for counselling and further diagnostics. According to the Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health, contaminated water, air and soil are responsible for about 9 million early deaths. About 92% of these deaths due to environmental toxicity occur in the low-income and middle-income countries, which include India."
