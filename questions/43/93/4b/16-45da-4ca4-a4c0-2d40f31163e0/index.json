  "question": "A study showed that Tamil Nadu ranks the lowest in terms of coverage of iodised salt. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Fortification of salt with iodine is mandatory in India.</li>\n<li>Iodine deficiency causes mental retardation.</li>\n<li>As Rajasthan is a major salt producer, iodine fortified salt coverage is better than the national average.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 3 is correct",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nIndia made fortification of salt with iodine mandatory for the first time in 1992. The norms were relaxed in 2000. The rule was reintroduced in 2005. Supreme Court in 2011 mandated ‘universal iodination of salt’ to tackle iodine deficiency.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nIodine is an essential micro-nutrient. It is connected to healthy development of mental and physical aspects. Its deficiency causes mental retardation and reduces the IQ by 13.5 units. Other issues caused by iodine deficiency are still-births, hypothyroidism, goitre, abortion, etc.\n<strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong>\nRajasthan is the second largest producer of salt in India after Gujarat. It produces 17% of the annual output. However, it has a coverage of only 65.5% with respect to iodinated salt for the people. The national average is 76.3%. The low coverage is due to easy access to the common salt as it is produced there.\n&nbsp;"
