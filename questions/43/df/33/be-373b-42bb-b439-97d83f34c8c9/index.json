  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nAccording to an FAO report, roots and tubers face the highest wastage of about 62%. Fruits and vegetables follow with over 41% wastage. In the context of weight, fruits and vegetables take up the largest portion of annual food wastage.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nApproximately 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of food produced for human consumption is wasted annually. This accounts for about 630 billion USD in industrialised countries and 310 billion USD in developing countries.
