  "question": "How the heartwood is different from sapwood in plants?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>While heartwood performs the function of water-conducting, sapwood provides strength</li>\r\n<li>Heartwood is more susceptible to pests and microbes in comparison to sapwood</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "Both heartwood and sapwood are names of secondary xylem formed by cambium (layers of tissues) during secondary growth. As the tree grows old, the wood at the centre ceases to perform the function of conduction and is blocked with organic compounds like oil, resins, and tannins, and develops a dark colour. This darkcoloured portion of the wood is called heartwood. The peripheral, light-coloured, better water-conducting wood is called sapwood. Heartwood is much more durable and resistant to micro-organisms, insects and pests."
