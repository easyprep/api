  "question": "The recent reduction in Customs duty on which product import is expected to benefit agarbatti manufacturers?",
  "option1": "Bamboo",
  "option2": "Charcoal",
  "option3": "Sandalwood Oil",
  "option4": "Coal",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Bamboo",
  "explanation": "As per the recent statement from the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Custom (CBIC), Customs duty on bamboo imports by agarbatti manufacturers has been hiked from 10 per cent to 25 per cent.\r\nThis is expected to encourage use of domestic bamboo by all industries. Earlier, only the large agarbatti manufacturers were able to import bamboo at lower rate. But due to the reduction in import, farmers as well as MSME agarbatti manufacturers would be benefitted. Moreover, uniform rate will help to prevent misuse and rate related disputes."
