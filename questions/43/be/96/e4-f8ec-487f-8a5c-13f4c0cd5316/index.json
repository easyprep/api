Preserving cultural traditions and ethnic diversity is a factor for not allowing human populations levels or rates to fall too low.<br />In the above question, first choice can be opted out easily with common sense. The choice is also not correct because zero population growth is seen with increase in elderly population which is opposite to demographic dividend. The third statement is correct."
