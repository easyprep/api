Donors can donate the bonds to their party of choice which can then be cashed in via the party\\'s verified account within 15 days. It must be noted that an electoral bond is designed to be a bearer instrument like a Promissory Note â€” in effect, it will be similar to a bank note that is payable to the bearer on demand and free of interest."
