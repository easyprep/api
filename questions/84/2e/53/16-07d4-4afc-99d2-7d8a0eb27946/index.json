  "answer": "Eliminate Industrial Produced Trans-fats",
  "explanation": "The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has launched a new mass media campaign “Heart Attack Rewind”  to eliminate industrially produced trans fat in the food supply by 2022 before WHO deadline.  The campaign is  the 30 second Public Service Announcement (PSA), which will warn citizens about the health hazards of consuming trans fats and offer strategies to avoid them through healthier alternatives. Edible oil industries took a pledge to reduce the levels of salt, sugar, saturated fat and trans fat content by 2% by 2022. As per records, trans fat intake leads to more than five lakh deaths from cardiovascular diseases every year, globally. Trans fat is made by adding hydrogen to liquid vegetable oils to solidify them and increase the shelf life of food. Trans fat is largely present in vanaspati, margarine, and bakery shortenings, and can be found in baked and fried foods."
