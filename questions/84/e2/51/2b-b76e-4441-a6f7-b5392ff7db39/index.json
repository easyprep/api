  "question": "With reference to the recent liberalisation measures undertaken on medical visa regime, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The norms now allow foreigners to get treatment for pre-existing conditions like organ transplants on their primary visa itself.</li>\n<li>The new norms of healthcare using primary visa will be applicable to foreign patients who were aware of pre-existing health conditions even before entry into the country.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nInitially, foreigners in India using primary visa were required to convert it to medical visa to get admitted at hospitals. The norms have been relaxed to allow their availing such services on primary visa itself. This will not be applicable to conditions due to organ transplant. In such cases, the original requirement of medical visa still applies.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe foreign nationals can avail the benefits under the liberalised visa norms even when aware of the health condition prior to the entry into the country. They can avail indoor medical treatment for a period of less than 180 days. Treatment for minor medical conditions can be availed from any hospital using primary visa itself."
