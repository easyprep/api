  "question": "The various Amendments of Citizenship Act in 1986 have resulted in the following:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Dual Citizenship</li>\r\n<li>Voting right at the age of 18 yrs</li>\r\n<li>Difficulty in acquiring citizenship by refugees of Sri Lanka, Bangladesh etc.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "The first thing we have to note that constitution of India has provided for a single citizenship for the whole country. Despite of having concepts such as OCI and PIO , which have been merged now, there is NO Dual Citizenship in India. The persons who are in these categories cannot exercise voting rights. This means that we can eliminate option 1. The voting rights option can be eliminated because voting is our constitutional right and the age 18 years replaced the 21 years in article 326 by Constitution (Sixty-first Amendment) Act, 1988. The 3rd option is correct and shows the purpose of the act."
