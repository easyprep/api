  "explanation": "As per the recent data by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, India posted a trade surplus of USD 790 million in June 2020.\r\nThis surplus has been recorded for the first time after over 18 years. Due to the Covid-19 induced decrease in domestic demand for crude oil, gold and other industrial products, the countryâ€™s import was deeply reduced. This led to a trade surplus with imports of USD 21.11 billion and exports of USD 21.91 billion."
