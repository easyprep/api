  "question": "After the first photons of light are produced, which process is responsible for amplification of the light?",
  "option1": "Blackbody radiation",
  "option2": "Stimulated emission",
  "option3": "Planck's radiation",
  "option4": "Einstein oscillation",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Stimulated emission",
  "explanation": "The word \"laser\" is actually an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of  radiation. Atoms or molecules of the active medium that have been excited to a higher energy level are stimulated by a passing photon to relax to a lower energy level and emit a photon that is indistinguishable from the passing photon, thereby increasing the number of photons like the incident one.",
