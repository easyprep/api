  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "None of the above",
  "option3": "All of the above",
  "option4": "1 and 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 2",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong> Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe ACSA is to be signed between Japan and India by the end of this year. It will allow India access to the Japanese base in Djibouti while Japan gets access to Indian installations in the Andaman and Nicobar islands. Djibouti is located on the Horn of Africa and enjoys proximity to the Bab-el-Mandeb. Hence multiple foreign military bases are located here- such as leased sites of the Americans, French and the Japanese.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nSabang port is in Indonesia. After signing the LEMOA or Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Understanding with the US, India signed similar agreements with countries like France, Singapore, etc. It has also led to India initiating its first deep sea port in Sabang. It is a part of “Shared Vision of Maritime Cooperation in the Indo Pacific” that India and Indonesia arrived at. It is also part of India’s venture in the south-east to counter China’s BRI.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nIndia is set to sign ARLS with Russia by this year end. It already has a signed agreement with USA in the form of LEMOA (2016). Hence after signing this agreement, India will be one of the very few nations that have logistics support agreement with both the cold war rivals. This is set to happen in September’s Eastern Economic Forum, to be held in Vladivostok. The beneficial impact will be maximum for the navies.\n&nbsp;"
