  "question": "Speed of a boat along and against the current are 12 km/hr and 8 km/hr respectively. Then the speed of the current in km/hr is :",
  "option1": 2,
  "option2": 3,
  "option3": 4,
  "option4": 5,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 2,
  "explanation": "Speed of current $latex = \\\\frac{1}{2}(Rate downstream - Rate Upstream)&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{1}{2}(12-8) = 2 km/hr&s=1$\r\nHence option [A] is correct answer."
