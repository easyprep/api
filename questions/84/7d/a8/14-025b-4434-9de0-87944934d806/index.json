  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "<strong>It can enhance the responsiveness of the government to a bad monsoon</strong> This is correct statement. The budget allocations are made in February/ March and generally itâ€™s too late. <img src=\\\"https://academy.gktoday.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/financialyear-monsoon.jpg\\\"> <strong>It can align India's statistical data with United Nations reporting standards</strong> This is also a correct statement and is an argument of NITI Aayog. <strong>Financial year and agricultural crop year will be same</strong> This is incorrect. Agricultural crop year in India is from July to 30 June. <strong>Financial years of government and RBI will be same</strong> This is incorrect. Financial year in RBI is also July to June."
