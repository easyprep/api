  "question": "Which one of the following rivers forms an estuary ?",
  "option1": "Narmada",
  "option2": "Kaveri",
  "option3": "Krishna",
  "option4": "Mahanadi",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Narmada",
  "explanation": "The Narmada, Periyar and Tapti are the only long rivers, which flow west and make estuaries. Wastern rivers do not form Delta whereas they form Estuaries because Hard Rocks of Western ghat don't allow Western flowing rivers to widen their mouth into sea, so these rivers form Estuaries whereas Eastern rivers flow through broken hills and mountain ranges."
