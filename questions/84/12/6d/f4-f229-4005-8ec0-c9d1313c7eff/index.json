Which of the following is/are the reason(s) for the same? <ol> <li>The cold&nbsp;Labrador Current&nbsp;mixes with the warm waters of the Gulf Stream&nbsp;near the Grand Banks</li> <li>The Grand Banks are part of North American&nbsp;continental shelf</li> </ol> &nbsp; &nbsp;Select the correct answer from options given below:",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The&nbsp;Grand Banks of Newfoundland&nbsp;are a group of underwater&nbsp;plateaus&nbsp;south-east of&nbsp;Newfoundland&nbsp;on the&nbsp;North American&nbsp;continental shelf. The cold&nbsp;Labrador Current mixes with the warm waters of the Gulf Stream&nbsp;here. The Continental shelves due to their shallowness enables sunlight to penetrate through the water, which encourages the growth of minute plants and other microscopic organisms. They are thus rich in plankton on which millions of Surface and bottom-feeding fishes thrive. This makes it one of the largest fishing grounds in the world."
