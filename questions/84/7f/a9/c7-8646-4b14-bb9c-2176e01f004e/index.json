  "question": "Which IIT institute has developed 'soil-to-soil' technology to manufacture cheaper, quicker and pollution-free bio fuel?",
  "option1": "IIT Bombay",
  "option2": "IIT Madras",
  "option3": "IIT Indore",
  "option4": "IIT Kharagpur",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "IIT Kharagpur",
  "explanation": "The researchers at IIT Kharagpur have developed a new technology to manufacture cheaper, quicker and pollution-free bio-fuel. The \\'soil-to-soil\\' manufacturing technology developed at the P K Sinha Centre for bio-energy at IIT-KGP is in the process of being patented.  The technique will ensure relatively quicker production of bio-fuel and the process is completely green. The green leafy part of corn and sugarcane plants, the waste part of paddy straw, bamboo, banana plant, pineapple and cotton plants, kans grass (kassh phool), castor plant and even non-edible weeds that grow in dry and waste land and a mix of all has been used by IIT-KGP to produce bio fuel. The project is funded by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Department of Science and Technology and the Ministry of Human Resource Development."
