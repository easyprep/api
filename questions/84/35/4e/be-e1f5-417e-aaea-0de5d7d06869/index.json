  "question": "The centre recently announced the extension of the AMRUT scheme by 2 more years. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is a 100% centrally funded scheme.</li>\n<li>The centre apprises individual projects for implementation under this scheme.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe AMRUT scheme is a centre- state collaborative effort to aid urbanisation. The central aid of up to 50% can be availed by cities with population of up to 10 lakh people. Cities with more than 10 lakh people can avail 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the project cost from the centre.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) was launched in 2015 as a replacement for the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. Unlike its predecessor, JNNURM, the AMRUT scheme does not require the centre to assess individual projects."
