  "option1": "Starch",
  "option2": "Proteins",
  "option3": "Fibers",
  "option4": "Fats",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Starch",
  "explanation": "The digestive functions of saliva include moistening food, and helping to create a food bolus, so it can be swallowed easily. Saliva contains the enzyme amylase that breaks some starches down into maltose and dextrin. Thus, digestion of food occurs within the mouth, even before food reaches the stomach."
