  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",

  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nBhut Jolokia is a hybrid chilli pepper variety noted for its traditional cultivation in north- east India. It is also known as ghost pepper or king chilli. It was listed as the world’s hottest chilli by Guinness World Records in 2007. It lost its status in 2011.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe heat intensity of Bhut Jolokia has been reduced by cross- pollination triggered by widespread cultivation. The heat has reduced from 1 million SHU to just 0.3 million SHU. Scoville Heat Unit of the Scoville Scale is used to measure the ‘heat’ or ‘spiciness’ of various food items, especially chilli peppers."
