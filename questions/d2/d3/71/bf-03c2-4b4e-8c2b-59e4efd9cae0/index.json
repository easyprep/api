  "answer": "Venezuela, Brazil, and Guyana",
  "explanation": "Venezuela, Brazil, and Guyana are the countries that are native to \"Pemon people\". The Pemon are indigenous people living in areas of Venezuela, Brazil, and Guyana. The Pemon are part of the larger Cariban language family. The Pemon were first encountered by westerners in the 18th century and converted by missionaries to Christianity. Their society is based on trade and considered egalitarian and decentralized, and in Venezuela, funding from petrodollars have helped fund community projects, and ecotourism opportunities are also being developed. In Venezuela, Pemon lives in the Gran Sabana grassland plateau dotted with tabletop mountains where the Angel Falls, the world's highest waterfall, plunges from Auyantepui in Canaima National Park. The Makuxi, who are also Pemon speakers, are found in Brazil and Guyana in areas close to the Venezuelan border.",
