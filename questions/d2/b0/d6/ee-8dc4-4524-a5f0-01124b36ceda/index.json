  "question": "How many FM channels under Phase III are present for auction by Union Cabinet?",
  "option1": 620,
  "option2": 520,
  "option3": 680,
  "option4": 780,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 680,
  "explanation": "The Union cabinet approved an auction of 683 private FM radio frequencies in 236 cities across the country under Phase III of FM radio privatization. The sale of these channels in Phase III is likely to generate direct and indirect employment to more than 10,000 persons on a pan-India basis. The third batch of FM auctions will cover cities with no private FM radio presence, including cities in border areas of Jammu and Kashmir and north-east states where the population is less than 100,000. With the completion of FM Phase III auctions, the government is planning to cover all the 29 states.",
