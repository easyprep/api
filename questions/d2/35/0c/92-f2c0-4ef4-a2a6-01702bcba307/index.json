  "question": "What total fertility rate is required to just replace the world&#8217;s existing population?",
  "option1": 1,
  "option2": 1.1,
  "option3": 2,
  "option4": 2.1,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 2.1,
  "explanation": "Demographers have estimated that on a global scale, replacement-level fertility implies a total fertility rate of<strong> about 2.1</strong>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><em>taking into account that some women never have children.</em></span>However, replacement-level fertility in less developed countries is higher because ofhigher rates of mortality among children and young adults of childbearing age. The total fertility rate worldwide is about 2.52. Thus births continue to outnumber deaths and the world&#8217;s population is expected to continue to increase during the foreseeable future ."
