  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 3 are correct",
  "explanation": "Only 1 &amp; 3 are correct statements. The first statement is correct that the NPR has a statutory status. But NPR finds its statutory status in the Citizenship Act 1955 which was amended and now the section 14A says that The Central Government may compulsorily register every citizen of India and issue national identity card to him and The Central Government may maintain a National Register of Indian Citizens and for that purpose establish a National Registration Authority."
