  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "<strong>In UK, Prime Minister must be a </strong><strong>member of the House of Commons but in India, Prime Minister may be a member of any house (Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha)</strong>\r\nThis is a correct statement. It is U.K. which is most often cited as an example of Parliamentary democracy wherein the P.M. should necessarily be a member of the House of Commons. However, the fact that ministers of one house cannot take part in proceedings of the other house in U.K. is often overlooked. Moreover, it needs to be laid out that the House of Lords is a completely non-representative body, unlike the Rajya Sabha, whose members are mostly elected from the states, though indirectly.Â  In India, PM has to be member of parliament regardless of which house he is in.\r\n<strong>In UK, Prime Minister is the head of the government, while in India, Prime Minister is the head of the state</strong>\r\nIn UK, Prime Minister is the head of the government (This is correct) but President is head of the state in India and not PM."
