  "question": "Consider the following statements about the “Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (INSPIRE)” programme: <ol> <li>It is an initiative by the Ministry of Human Resource Development</li> <li>Under this programme, government conducts a national level competitive exam to select students and provides them scholarship for scientific research</li> </ol>  Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because INSPIRE programme is an initiative by Ministry of Science &amp; Technology and not by the Ministry of Human Resource Development. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u> because the programme does not believe in conducting competitive exams for identification of talent at any level. It believes in and relies on the efficacy of the existing educational structure for identification of talent. It provides opportunity to the students of Indian origin excluding NRI/PIO status to pursue career in research field. The programme was launched in December, 2008. Its basic objective is to attract young talents and motivate them for studying science from an early age and pursuing career in research field. It helps to build the required critical human resource pool for strengthening and expanding the S &amp; T and R &amp; D base in the country."
