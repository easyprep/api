  "answer": "Taiwan",
  "explanation": "Taiwan has become the first Asian country to recognize same sex marriage after the constitutional court's ruling comes in support of legalizing same-sex marriage. The panel of judges has given the island's parliament, known as the Legislative Yuan, two years to amend or enact new laws, which could potentially make Taiwan the first place in Asia to allow same-sex marriage. The island has a large gay community and its annual gay pride parade is the biggest in Asia.",
