  "question": "Which boxing defense technique in which a boxer moves the head laterally and beneath an incoming punch?",
  "option1": "Slipping",
  "option2": "Bobbing",
  "option3": "Blocking",
  "option4": "Clinching",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Bobbing",
  "explanation": "Bobbing moves the head laterally and beneath an incoming punch. As the opponent's punch arrives, the boxer bends the legs quickly and simultaneously shifts the body either slightly right or left. Once the punch has been evaded, the boxer \"weaves\" back to an upright position, emerging on either the outside or inside of the opponent's still-extended arm. To move outside the opponent's extended arm is called \"bobbing to the outside\". To move inside the opponent's extended arm is called \"bobbing to the inside\"."
