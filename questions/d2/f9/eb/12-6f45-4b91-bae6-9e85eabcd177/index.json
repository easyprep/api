  "explanation": "The Coral Triangle is a geographical marine area located in the western Pacific Ocean. Coral Triangle is a six million square kilometre area covers the parts or entirety of waters of six countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste and Solomon Islands. This area is divided into two regions:- Indonesian-Philippines Region and the Far Southwestern Pacific Region. Coral Triangle houses 76% of the world's coral species, the highest coral diversity in the world. The epicentre of that coral diversity is found in the Bird's Head Peninsula of Indonesian Papua. Within the Bird's Head Peninsula, the Raja Ampat archipelago is the world's coral diversity bull's eye. It occupies just 1.5% of the world's total ocean area but represents 30% of the world's coral reefs. The coral triangle has more coral reef fish diversity than anywhere else in the world. It houses 37% of the world's coral reef fish species and 56% of the coral reef fishes in the Indo-Pacific region. This area houses six of the world's seven marine turtle species."
