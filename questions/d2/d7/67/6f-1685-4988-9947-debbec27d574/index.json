  "question": "In context with the risk of Missed Abortion in the First Trimester/ MAFT due to air pollution highlighted by recent studies, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Bleeding and pain are some of the symptoms of MAFT.</li>\n<li>The risk of MAFT is more among older women.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nMAFT is devoid of significant symptoms. In MAFT, the foetus dies or stops growing and it doesn’t show physical symptoms like bleeding or pain. This occurs within 12 weeks of pregnancy. Often, the women are unaware that the pregnancy has ceased.\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe study found that the risk of MAFT is higher among women who are older than 39 years of age. This especially affected female farmers and blue-collared workers. This complication arises because of penetration of the pollutants into the placental tissue."
