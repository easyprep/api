  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "President is entitled to a number of privileges and immunities. He enjoys personal immunity from legal liability for his personal acts. During his term of office, he is immune from any criminal proceedings, even in respect of his personal acts; however, after giving two month&rsquo;s notice, civil proceedings can be instituted against him during his term of office in respect of his personal acts. So, First statement is correct. Second statement is incorrect because even after the expiration of term of office of President, he continues to act as President until his successor joins the office. The Vice-President does not get the opportunity to discharge the duties of President in such situation."
