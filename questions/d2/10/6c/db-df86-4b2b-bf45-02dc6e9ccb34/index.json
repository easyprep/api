  "question": "For developing in bred lines in farm animals, following factors are taken into consideration:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The crossbreds should be of outstanding type.</li>\r\n<li>They should not carry any detrimental genes.</li>\r\n<li>Progeney tested animals.</li>\r\n<li>Herd size should be large.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nOf the statements given above, which one of the following combinations of factors is most essential?",
  "option1": "1 and 3",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 and 4",
  "option4": "2 and 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 and 4",
  "explanation": "InbreedingÂ results in homozygosity, which can increase the chances of offspring being affected by deleterious or recessive traits. This usually leads to at least temporarily decreased biological fitness of a population which is its ability to survive and reproduce. So for inbreeding they should not carry any detrimental genes and it is effective only if the herd is large."
