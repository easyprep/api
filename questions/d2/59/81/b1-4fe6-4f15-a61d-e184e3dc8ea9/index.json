  "question": "Which of the following substances is used in the tip of safety match stick?",
  "option1": "Red phosphorus",
  "option2": "Sodium",
  "option3": "Yellow phosphorus",
  "option4": "Potassium chlorate",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Potassium chlorate",
  "explanation": "The chemical present in matchstick is potassium chlorate, sulfur, starch and glue. When the match is struck against the rubbing surface, some red phosphorus gets converted into white phosphorus. This immediately reacts with potassium chlorate in the matchstick head to produce enough heat to ignite antimony trisulphide and start the combustion."
