  "explanation": "The national cricket team of New Zealand was awarded the Christopher Martin-Jenkins Spirit of Cricket award for the year 2019. England team captain Kane Williamson was presented with the award during the drawn second Test between his team and England.The New Zealand team has been recognized for their sporting conduct following a dramatic defeat by England in ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2019 final at Lord’s in July 2019. However, even though England lifted the trophy on basis of boundary count as runs were tied in both 50-over match and Super Over, the New Zealand team gained praise for their humility after losing the premier tournament. Thus, Kane Williamson-led team’s on and off-field display during World Cup final earned them the award."
