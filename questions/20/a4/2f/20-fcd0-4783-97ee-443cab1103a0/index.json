  "answer": "Both situations A and B explain the spring tides.",
  "explanation": "Spring tide is a tide in which the difference between high and low tide is the greatest. Spring tides occur when the Moon is either new or full, and the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth are aligned. When this is the case, their collective gravitational pull on the Earth\\'s water is strengthened. Compare neap tide."
