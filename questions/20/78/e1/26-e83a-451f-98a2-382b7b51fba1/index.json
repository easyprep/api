Malaria&nbsp;is a mosquito-borne infectious disease affecting humans and other animals caused by parasitic protozoans belonging to the Plasmodium type. Dengue&nbsp;fever is transmitted by the bite of an Aedes mosquito infected with a&nbsp;dengue&nbsp;virus. Kala-Azar&nbsp;is a slow progressing indigenous disease caused by a protozoan parasite of genus Leishmania. In India Leishmania donovani is the only parasite causing this disease. All of the above given diseases are controlled under the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme."
