  "question": "Which gas is called the “firedamp” in coal mines?",
  "option1": "Hydrogen",
  "option2": "Carbon monoxide",
  "option3": "Air",
  "option4": "Methane",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Methane",
  "explanation": "Firedamp is flammable gas found in coal mines. It is the name given to a number of flammable gases, especially methane. Firedamp is a gas that occurs naturally in coal seams. Firedamp gas is nearly always methane (CH4) and is highly inflammable and explosive when present in the air in a proportion of 5 to 14 per cent. Fire-damp has always been a source of terror for miners in coal districts. It is formed from the initial biological matter during geological processes in the course of carbonization. Fire-damp has a somewhat different composition than natural gas accompanying oil, therefore it is sometimes called \"carboniferous natural gas\"."
