  "question": "By what per cent must the cost price be raised in fixing the sale price in order that there may be a profit of 20% after allowing a commission of 10%?",
  "option1": "$latex 25\\%$",
  "option2": "$latex 133 \\frac{1}{3}&s=1$",
  "option3": "$latex 33 \\frac{1}{3}&s=1$",
  "option4": "$latex 30\\%$",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "$latex 33 \\frac{1}{3}&s=1$",
  "explanation": "Let the CP = 100 Rs. \r\nThen, SP = 120 Rs. \r\nLet the marked price = x Rs. \r\nThen, 90% of x = 120 Rs. \r\n$latex => x = \\\\frac{120\\\\times 100}{90}&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{400}{3} = 133\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\%&s=1$\r\nHence, the marked price is $latex 33\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\%&s=1$ above the cost price."
