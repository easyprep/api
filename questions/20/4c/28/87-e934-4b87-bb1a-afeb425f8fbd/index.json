  "option4": "J.J Thompson",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "J.J Thompson",
  "explanation": "J.J Thompson was the first scientist to discover and identify the electrons and to make the discovery of the first subatomic particle. He was also the first scientist to find evidence for isotopes of a stable (non-radioactive) element in 1913, as part of his exploration into the composition of canal rays (positive ions). His experiments to determine the nature of positively charged particles led to the development of the mass spectrograph. J.J Thompson belonged to United Kingdom. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906 for his work on the conduction of electricity in gases."
