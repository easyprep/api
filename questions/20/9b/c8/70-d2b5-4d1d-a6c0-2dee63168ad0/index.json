  "option1": "Turkey",
  "option2": "Greece",
  "option3": "Russia",
  "option4": "Iran",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Russia",
  "explanation": "Occupied territories of Georgia are the territories occupied by Russia after the Russo-Georgian War in 2008. They consist of the regions of Abkhazia and the former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast of Soviet Georgia (currently divided between several administrative divisions of independent Georgia), whose status is a matter of international dispute. After the 2008 war and subsequent Russian military occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the Russian government, along with four other UN member states, considers the territories as sovereign independent states: the Republic of Abkhazia and the Republic of South Ossetia. Both Abkhazia and South Ossetia are widely recognized as integral parts of Georgia and together represent 20% of Georgia's internationally recognized territory. The Georgian \"Law on Occupied Territories of Georgia\", adopted in 2008, criminalizes and prosecutes entry into Abkhazia and South Ossetia from the Russian side without special permission."
