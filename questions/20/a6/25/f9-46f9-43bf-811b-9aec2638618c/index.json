  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "Sthanakavasi sect of Jainism believes that soul is nirakar “without form”, and hence do not pray to any statue. They wear white cloths and cover mouth with a white cloth. Except on the crucial point of idol-worship, Sthanakwasi do not differ much from other Shwetambar Jains and hence now-a-days they invariably call themselves as Shwetambar Sthanakwasi. However, there are some differences between the Sthanakwasi; and the Murtipujak Shwetambars in the observance of some religious practices. The Sthanakwasi do not believe in idol-worship at all. As such they do not have temples but only sthanakas, that is, prayer halls, where they carry on their religious fasts, festivals, practices, prayers, discourses, etc."
