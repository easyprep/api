  "question": "With reference to the Milky way galaxy, which among the following statements is / are correct?<br> 1.The Milky Way is a member of the Virgo super cluster<br> 2.The two most massive members of the Virgo super cluster are the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy<br> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "A galaxy is a group of large number of stars in the sky which have generally the same origin of evolution, such as our Milky Way. A galaxy may contain billions of stars. A cluster of galaxies, which may have up to 10 or even more galaxies is called a local group. Clusters of galaxies are known as a super galaxy, or a super cluster. This may have up to 50 or even 1,000 galaxies. The Milky Way is a member of the Virgo super cluster. However, before that its is a part of smaller &#8220;Local group&#8221;. Local Group is the group of galaxies that includes Earth&#8217;s galaxy, the Milky Way. The group comprises more than 54 galaxies (including dwarf galaxies), with its gravitational center located somewhere between the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy. The galaxies of the Local Group cover a 10 million light-year diameter and have a binary (dumbbell) shape. This group itself is part of the Virgo Supercluster. Thus second statement is not correct. Virgo Supercluster contains the Virgo Cluster in addition to the Local Group, which in turn contains the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies. At least 100 galaxy groups and clusters are located within its diameter of 33 megaparsecs. It is one of millions of superclusters in the observable Universe."
