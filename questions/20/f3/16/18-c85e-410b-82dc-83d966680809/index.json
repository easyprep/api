Its goal is to enhance fisheriesâ€™ output and productivity.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe project will launch an online database from October onwards. The database will be available on the websites of CMFRI and the NFDB. It will provide informations like pricing, species availability, transport access, infrastructure availability, geographical location, size, etc. This will be with respect to 150 commercially important fishes.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\n55% of fish production in India is from inland fisheries and freshwater aquaculture.
