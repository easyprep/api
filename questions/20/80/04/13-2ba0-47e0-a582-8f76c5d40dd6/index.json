The MahaDBT portal is an Aadhaar-authenticated electronic mechanism that will enable direct transfer of benefits for over 40 schemes currently implemented.

On the other hand, MahaVASTU portal is an online building permission management system, through which construction approvals will be sanctioned with full transparency."
