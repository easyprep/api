  "question": "How does<strong>Â </strong>heavy rainfall affects soil?",
  "option1": "Increasing its acidity",
  "option2": "Increasing its alkalinity",
  "option3": "Reducing its fertility",
  "option4": "None of these",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Increasing its acidity",
  "explanation": "Changes in precipitation affect vegetation which has impacts on soil, organic matter cycle and the texture of soil. This can influence the runoff rate and formation of surface crusts, which affect erosion and cause deterioration.<br />Temperature and rainfall control leaching intensity and soil mineral weathering. In warm, humid environments, soil pH decreases over time in a process called soil acidification, due to leaching from high amounts of rainfall."
