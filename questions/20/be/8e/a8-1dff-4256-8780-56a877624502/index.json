  "option4": "Only 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Generally the biodiesel made from vegetable oil does not perform well in cold climates. This is because the vegetable oil is high in saturated fats and the ice crystals tend to form in the biodiesel. Further, the biodiesel obtained from certain crops such as canola oil is low in saturated fat, it is harder for ice to materialize in frigid temperatures, it is found to be showing excellent performance in cold climates too."
