  "explanation": "Delhi started supplying Ultra-clean Euro-VI or Bharat Stage (BS)-VI grade petrol and diesel without any additional cost in order to curb air pollution. It become the first city in India to switch from Euro-IV grade petrol and diesel to Euro-VI grade petrol and diesel. Cities in the national capital region like Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram and Faridabad and 13 major cities like Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune will switch to Euro-VI grade fuel from 1st January 2018. Rest of India will switch to Euro-VI grade fuel from April 2020. Euro-VI grade fuel is estimated to cost nearly 50 paisa a litre more. But customers are not charged any additional cost. Mathura refinery in Uttar Pradesh, Panipat refinery in Haryana, Bina refinery in Madhya Pradesh and Bhatinda refinery in Punjab are currently supplying Euro-VI grade fuel to Delhi.",
