  "explanation": "Guatemala and Mexico are the two countries that share the location of the geographical subregion \"Peten Basin\". The Peten Basin is a geographical subregion of Mesoamerica, primarily located in northern Guatemala within the Department of El Peten, and into Campeche state in southeastern Mexico. During the Late Preclassic and Classic periods of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican chronology many major centres of the Maya civilization flourished, such as Tikal and Calakmul. A distinctive Peten-style of Maya architecture and inscriptions arose. The archaeological sites La Sufricaya and Holmul are also located in this region.",
