  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nMarie Antoinette Syndrome is a condition where the hair of a person turns grey in a short period of time. It is named after the French Queen whose hair is said to have turned white overnight before her execution. It is reported to be caused due to stress factors.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe syndrome is caused by a compound called norepinephrine- a hormone and a neurotransmitter. The compound is released from sympathetic nerves due to stress. It causes excessive activation of a certain reservoir of stem cells which are necessary for producing hair pigments. This activation leads to loss of the cells in just a few days."
