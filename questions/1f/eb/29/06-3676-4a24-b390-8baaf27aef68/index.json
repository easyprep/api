  "question": "Consider the following statements regarding Neem Coated Urea:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It gives higher crop yields</li>\r\n<li>Reduces underground water contamination</li>\r\n<li>Suitable for industrial uses</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct answer from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Neem coated urea is required less in quantity with same plot size and gives higher crop yields. Underground water contamination due to leaching of urea also gets reduced with neem coating since nitrogen in the neem coated urea gets released to plants very slowly. Neem coated urea is not fit for industrial use."
