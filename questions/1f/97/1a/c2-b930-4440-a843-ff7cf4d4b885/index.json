  "question": "Consider the following statements about National Nutrition Mission (NNM): <ol> <li>It is being implemented under the aegis of Ministry of Women and Child Development</li> <li>The mission aims to reduce the stunting and low birth weights by 8% by 2022</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is correct</u>. The mission is being implemented under the aegis of Ministry of Women and Child Development. The National Nutrition Mission is being funded by the Government Budgetary Support (50% of the total) and 50% by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) or other Multilateral Development Banks (MDB). In case of National Nutrition Mission (NNM), the Government budgetary support would be 60:40 between Centre and States/UTs, 90:10 for NER and Himalayan States and 100% for UTs without the legislature. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u>. The mission aims to reduce low birth weight by 2%, 2%, 3% and 2% per annum respectively and targets to reduce stunting is at-least 2% per annum. This mission would strive to achieve a reduction in Stunting from 38.4% (NFHS-4) to 25% by 2022 (Mission 25 by 2022)."
