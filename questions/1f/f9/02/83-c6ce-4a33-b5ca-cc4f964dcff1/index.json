  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe 3S program is an initiative of WHO. It stands for Smart Safety Surveillance program. The international health body has been recommending the project to several countries to improve the safety of health infrastructure through smart surveillance. It is also being aided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  \n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe 3S program seeks to strengthen the vaccination component of India’s health system. The Rotavirus vaccine is being surveyed through this program. It was launched because of India’s limited possession of safety data with respect to vaccination. Optimisation of post-marketing surveillance of high priority drugs is also one of the objectives."
