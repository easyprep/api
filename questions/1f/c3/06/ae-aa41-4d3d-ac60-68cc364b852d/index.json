  "question": "Which of the following statements is/are correct regarding ‘Pin1’?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It is known as a master regulator of cancer signalling networks</li>\r\n<li>It is a primary cancer drug which inhibits the growth of cancer stem cells</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option form the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 only",
  "option2": "2 only",
  "option3": "Both 1 and 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 only",
  "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: Pin1 is known as a master regulator of cancer signalling networks that activates more than 40 cancer-driving proteins and inactivates more than 20 tumour suppressing proteins. <br />Statement 2 is incorrect: The enzyme was found to be over-activated in most human cancers and is especially active in cancer stem cells — a subpopulation of cancer cells believed to drive tumour initiation, progression, and metastasis, but not effectively targeted by current therapies."
