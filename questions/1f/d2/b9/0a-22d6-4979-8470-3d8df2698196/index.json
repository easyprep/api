Since the act embodied reforms as recommended by a report of Edwin Montagu {Secretary of State for India} and Lord Chelmsford {Viceroy and Governor General}, it is also called as <em>Montague-Chelmsford Reforms</em> or simply <em>Mont-Ford Reforms</em>. The most notable feature of the act was “end of benevolent despotism” and introduction of responsible government in India."
