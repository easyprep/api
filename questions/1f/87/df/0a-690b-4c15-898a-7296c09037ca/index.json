  "question": "The modulus of rigidity is the ratio of which of the following?",
  "option1": "Volume stress to volume strain",
  "option2": "Longitudinal stress to longitudinal strain",
  "option3": "Tensile stress to tensile strain",
  "option4": "Shearing stress to sheering strain",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Shearing stress to sheering strain",
  "explanation": "Shear modulus or modulus of rigidity is defined as the ratio of shear stress to the shear strain: where shear stress is the force which acts is the area on which the force acts is shear strain."
