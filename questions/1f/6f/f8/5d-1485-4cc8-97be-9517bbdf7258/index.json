Wi-Fi Direct does not need a wireless access point<br> 2.

  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "To connect two devices wirelessly, you would typically require a Wi-Fi setup in which a router broadcasts a network and your devices &#8211; be it a PC, phone, laptop, netbook, or TV &#8211; all connect to the router. The router in turn, acts as starting point, enabling connected devices to communicate with each other. Opposed to this conventional way, with Wi-Fi Direct, compatible devices can connect directly by generating their own wireless network. While most devices across gadget categories (TV, Printers, etc.) have Wi-Fi connectivity in-built as an option, moving forward, Wi-Fi Direct will be the easiest way to share data. Devices like Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy S/ SII and LG Optimus Black P970 and even printers that can work with Wi-Fi Direct are available in the market."
