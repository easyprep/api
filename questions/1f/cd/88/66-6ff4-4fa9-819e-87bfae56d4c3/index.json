  "question": "Two pipes can fill a cistern in 3 hours and 4 hours respectively and a waste pipe can empty it in 2 hours. If all the three pipes are kept open, then the cistern will be filled in :",
  "option1": "10 hours",
  "option2": "12 hours",
  "option3": "5 hours",
  "option4": "8 hours",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "12 hours",
  "explanation": "Part of the cistern filled in 1 hour = $latex \\\\frac{1}{3}+\\\\frac{1}{4}-\\\\frac{1}{2}&s=1$\r\n(Cistern filled by 1st pipe + Cistern filled by 2nd pipe - Cistern emptied by 3rd pipe )\r\n$latex =>\\\\frac{4+3-6}{12}=\\\\frac{1}{12}&s=1$\r\nHence, the cistern will be filled in 12 hours.\r\nSo option [B] is the right answer."
