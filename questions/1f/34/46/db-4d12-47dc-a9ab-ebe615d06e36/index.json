  "explanation": "The Sangai deer is found only in Manipur. It lives in the marshy wetland in the Keibul Lamjao National Park. Its habitat is located in the southern parts of the Loktak Lake, which is the largest freshwater lake in Eastern India. The habitat of the Sangai is now protected as the Keibul Lamjao National Park. The Sangai is the State animal of Manipur and is projected as the social and the cultural identity of the State. The Ganges river dolphin is primarily found in the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers and their tributaries in Bangladesh, India and Nepal. The GIB is a heavy bird, weighing 15-16 kg. As per recent estimate, the global population is about 300 birds. The population is fragmented into eight populations in the states of Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Madhya Pradesh in India, the maximum being in Rajasthan, and parts of Pakistan. Dugong is a medium-sized mammal. Its current distribution is fragmented, and many populations are believed to be close to extinction. Dugongs are spread in the waters of some 40 countries and territories throughout the Indo-West Pacific."
