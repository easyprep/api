  "option3": "400 km",
  "option4": "420 km",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "420 km",
  "explanation": "$latex Time = 10\\\\frac{1}{2}hours&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{21}{2}hours&s=1$\r\n$latex Speed = 40km/h$\r\n$latex Distance = Speed \\\\times Time$\r\n$latex = 40\\\\times \\\\frac{21}{2} = 420 km&s=1$\r\nHence option [D] is correct answer"
