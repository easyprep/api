  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Apartheid was the official doctrine of the South African government, and the ruling National Party, between 1948 and 1991. Meaning ‘separateness’, it was in practice nothing more than an excuse for domination by the white minority population of blacks and ‘coloureds’. The word ‘coloured’ is used here in the South African legal sense as someone who cannot be classified as black, but is not ‘purely’ white. Apartheid consisted of a set of legal inequalities. The aim of apartheid was to separate all the people of South Africa into small independent nations. But the National Party government did not want to spend a lot of money on this project. Also, they wanted to keep most of South Africa’s land for white people. Especially the rich parts of the country, like the gold mines of Johannesburg. They also wanted black people to work in these mines for little money. However, they did not want black men’s families to live in the same area."
