  "explanation": "The World Stroke Day  (WSD) is observed every year on 29th October to raise awareness and reduce the incidence of stroke across the world. A stroke is a disease that affects the arteries of the brain. Whenever an artery carrying oxygen and nutrients to the brain gets obstructed by a clot or ruptures - the specific part of the brain where this happens dies. There is also the possibility of a mini or temporary ischaemic stroke caused by a floating clot, temporarily blocking the blood supply. The effect of any type of stroke (also known as brain attack) is debilitating - restricted blood flow alters or stops the functions of that specific part of the brain, sometimes leading to paralysis."
