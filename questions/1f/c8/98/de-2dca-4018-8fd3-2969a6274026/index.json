  "question": "Recently, the Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra recommended for the impeachment of Justice Shri Narayan Shukla, a senior judge of the Allahabad High Court. In this context, consider the following statements: <ol> <li>The procedure of impeachment is same for judges of Supreme Court and High Courts</li> <li>Not a single Judge has been impeached in India so far.</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is correct.</u> The procedure of impeachment is same for the judges of Supreme Court and High Court Judges. A judge of Supreme Court can be removed only on grounds of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. The Judges Inquiry Act, 1968 provides for the inquiry of the conduct of a judge to prove the charges against him/her. The same procedure is followed for removal of judge of High Court. <u>Second statement is correct.</u> The procedure for impeachment of judges in India is highly complex due to which all impeachment proceedings so far have failed."
