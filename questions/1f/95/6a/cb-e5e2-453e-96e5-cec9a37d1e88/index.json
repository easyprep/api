  "question": "In recent news, the three body problem has been discusses. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The three body problem was given by Newton.</li>\n<li>It involves gravitational forces from all three bodies.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe three body problem was given by Isaac Newton. He was unable to come up with an answer to predict and explain the systemâ€™s behaviour. Over the years, many scientists have tried to solve it. Recently, scientists have combined AI with neural networks to get closer to a solution.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe three body problem involves 3 objects orbiting one another. These bodies exert gravitational forces (an attractive force). Since it is a chaotic system, how these three objects move and are influenced by the others remain a complex question."
