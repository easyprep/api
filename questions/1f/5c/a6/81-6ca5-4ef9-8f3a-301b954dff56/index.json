The other identified sites are Taj Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri, Ajanta and Ellora, etc.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\n“Adopt a Heritage” scheme does not receive fund from the ministry of tourism. It seeks to attract the involvement of public/ private organisation/ individuals for the upkeep of heritage sites and monuments. Dalmia group had adopted the Red Fort. Yatra Online had adopted the Ajanta and Qutub Minar.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe ASI had identified 100 monuments under the Adarsh Samark scheme. This scheme looks to improve the amenities for the tourists. Implementation of Swachch Bharat Abhiyan is one of the objectives. It will also look to provide wifi facilities, interpretation and AV centres, etc. eg: Elephanta caves, red fort, Konark Temple etc are some of these monuments."
