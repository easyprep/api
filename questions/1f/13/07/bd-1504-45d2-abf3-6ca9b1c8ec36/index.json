  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "3 only",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe guidelines are applicable only to the public sector banks. Separate guidelines for the private sector and the NBFCs are still being created by the RBI. These rules will determine the formation of the banks’ board of directors. It gives criteria for composition of the NRC.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe NRC will not contain a director nominated by the centre. It will have a minimum of 3 non-executive directors. Atleast half of the board will be independent directors. Atleast one director will be from the risk management committee. The restructuring is along the lines of the Bank Board Bureau recommendations and Companies act provisions.  \n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe fit and proper criteria gives a negative list for the first time. This gives the conditions for a director’s disqualification. A member’s engagement in stock broking is one such condition. Other conditions include member’s being a parliamentarian or a member of state legislature, etc"
