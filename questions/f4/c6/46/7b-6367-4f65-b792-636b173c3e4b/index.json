  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "<strong>It is a non-lapsable fund created exclusively for construction of national highways under the National Highways Act, 1956</strong> This statement is incorrect. Central Road Fund (CRF) is a non-lapsable fund created under Central Road Fund Act 2000. It was in news recently, when the Central Road Fund (Amendment) Bill, 2017 was introduced in Lok Sabha by the Minister of Road Transport and Highways, Mr. Nitin Gadkari. The Bill amends the Central Road Fund Act, 2000. Under the 2000 Act, the fund can be utilised for various road projects like national highways; state roads including roads of inter-state and economic importance, and rural roads. However, the amendment Bill provides that in addition to these the fund should also be used for the development and maintenance of national waterways. The bill is still pending in Lok Sabha.  <strong>The fund is collected through cess imposed on petrol and diesel </strong> <u>This statement is correct</u> because the amount of the fund is procured out of cess/tax imposed by the Union Government on the consumption of Petrol and Diesel. The revenue collected under CRF Act is initially credited to the Consolidated Fund of India. After adjusting for the cost of tax collection, it is credited separately into the Central Road fund (CRF)."
