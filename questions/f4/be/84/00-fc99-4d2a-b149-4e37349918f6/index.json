  "question": "In what time 8000 Rs. will amount to 9261 Rs. at 10% per annum compound interest, when the interest is compounded half yearly?",
  "option1": "1.5 years",
  "option2": "2 years",
  "option3": "2.5 years",
  "option4": "3 years",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1.5 years",
  "explanation": "Interest is compounded half yearly. \r\nâˆ´ Rate of interest = 5%\r\n$latex Time = \\\\frac{n}{2}\\\\ years&s=1$\r\n$latex \\\\because A = P(1 + \\\\frac{R}{100})^{T}&s=1$\r\n$latex => 9261 = 8000 (1 + \\\\frac{5}{100})^{n}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{9261}{8000} = (\\\\frac{21}{20})^{n}&s=1$\r\n$latex => (\\\\frac{21}{20})^{3} = (\\\\frac{21}{20})^{n}&s=1$\r\n$latex => n = 3\\\\ half\\\\ years$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\ years = 1\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ years&s=1$\r\nHence option [A] is correct answer."
