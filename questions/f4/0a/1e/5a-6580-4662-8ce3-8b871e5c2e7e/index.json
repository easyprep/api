  "question": "With respect to the recent debate about the International Maritime Organisation’s new rules (IMO 2020) for ships in the Arctic, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The IMO 2020 banned ships using fuels with sulphur content over 3.5%.</li>\n<li>The use of Marine Gas Oil is banned by IMO 2020.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe IMO (International Maritime Organisation) is the shipping agency of the United Nations. The IMO 2020 regulations banned the ships using fuels with sulphur content over 0.5%. The previous limit was 3.5%. This is to reduce the emission of SOx.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe MGO or Marine Gas Oil is not banned by IMO. It is one of the clean fuel alternatives for the shipping industries apart from VLSFO or Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil. The MGO is made exclusively from distillates. The VLSFO was recently claimed to be increasing black carbon emissions."
