  "question": "As per a recent study, the researchers detected an exoplanet named ‘HIP 67522 b’. What is it otherwise called?",
  "option1": "Hot Jupiter",
  "option2": "Super-Earth",
  "option3": "Mini-Neptune",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Hot Jupiter",
  "explanation": "According to the new study published in the Astronomical Journal, the researchers have detected the exoplanet HIP 67522 b.\r\nThe exoplanet appears to be the youngest hot Jupiter ever found. It also orbits around a well-studied star that is about 17 million years old. This means that the hot Jupiter is only a few million years younger probably. As most known hot Jupiters are more than a billion years old, this is likely the youngest hot Jupiter."
