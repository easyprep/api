  "explanation": "The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has set up a high-level committee to look into the successful  implementation of Clause 6 of the Assam Accord of 1985. The committee is headed by a retired IAS officer MP Bezbarauah and includes eminent Assamese personalities from various fields. The Committee will suggest measures to be taken to protect Assamese and other indigenous languages of Assam. It will also recommend the appropriate level of reservations in employment under the Government of Assam for the Assamese people.  The panel will submit its report within the six months to the Centre.  The move comes at a time when the National Register of Citizens (NRC) is being updated and the Centre is trying to introduce a contentious Bill on citizenship. The Clause 6 of the Assam Accord envisages that appropriate constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards should be provided to protect, preserve and promote the cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the ethnic Assamese."
