  "question": "A and B can complete a piece of work in 8 days, B and C can do it in 12 days, C and A do it in 8 days. A, B and C together can complete it in :",
  "option1": "4 days",
  "option2": "5 days",
  "option3": "6 days",
  "option4": "7 days",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "6 days",
  "explanation": "(A + B)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{8}&s=1$\r\n(B + C)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{12}&s=1$\r\n(C + A)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{8}&s=1$\r\nOn adding, \r\n2(A + B + C)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{8}+\\\\frac{1}{12}+\\\\frac{1}{8} = \\\\frac{3+2+3}{24} = \\\\frac{1}{3}&s=1$\r\nâˆ´ (A + B + C)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{6}&s=1$\r\nSo the work will be completed in 6 days. \r\nHence option [C] is correct answer."
