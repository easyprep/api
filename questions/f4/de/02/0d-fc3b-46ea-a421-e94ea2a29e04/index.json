  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe UNESCO maintains 2 lists. The Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity help in demonstrating the diversity of culture and helps raise awareness about them. The List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding is the shorter list meant for urgent conservation of certain cultural treasures.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Kumbh Mela was added to the representative list of intangible cultural heritage in 2017 by UNESCO.
