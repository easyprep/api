  "answer": "Salabat Jung",
  "explanation": "Salabat Jung was the 4th Nizam of Hyderabad and the 3rd son of Nizam-ul-Mulk. After death of Nizam-ul-Mulk, the question of succession gave opportunities to the Marathas,French and the English to play King Makers. In 1751-52, Nizam Salabat Jang secured the protection of the French general, Bussy. This made Hyderabad stronger and it was not easy to eliminate the Nizam so long French General was there."
