  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct. Second statement is incorrect&nbsp;because there is no law which defines the term&nbsp;&ldquo;Office of Profit&rdquo;. Hence the final power lies in the hands of Supreme Court of India to define office of profit. Clause (a) of Article 102 of the Constitution of India says a person shall be disqualified for being chosen as, and for being, a member of either house of Parliament, if he holds any &quot;office of profit&quot; under the Government of India or the Government of any State other than an office declared by Parliament by law not to disqualify its holder."
