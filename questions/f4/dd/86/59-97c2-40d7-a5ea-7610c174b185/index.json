  "option1": "Directly to the people",
  "option2": "To legislature",
  "option3": "To judiciary",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "To legislature",
  "explanation": "The Constitution of India states that the Executive branch of the State (Council of Ministers) shall be collectively responsible to the Legislature (House of the People). This implies that Parliament should oversee the work of the government and hold it responsible for its actions and omissions.<br />Two ways through which Parliament controls the executive are:<br />• The Parliament keeps a day-to-day watch over the activities of the Executive. As ours is a parliamentary system of Government, the Executive is responsible to the Parliament for all acts of omissions and commissions. The Parliament may remove a Cabinet out of power by a vote of no confidence. It may reject a bill or a budget proposal of the Cabinet.<br />• Members of the Parliament have a right to ask questions and supplementary question to the Ministers. Any lapses or mishandling on the part of the Government can be exposed in the Parliament."
