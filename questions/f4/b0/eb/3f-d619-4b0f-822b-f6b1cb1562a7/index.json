  "question": "For short-term climate prediction, which one of the following events, detected in the last decade, is associated with occasional weak monsoon rains in the India subcontinent?",
  "option1": "La Nina",
  "option2": "Movement of Jet Streams",
  "option3": "El Nino and Southern Oscillations",
  "option4": "Greenhouse effects on global level",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Movement of Jet Streams",
  "explanation": "Movement of Jet stream affects the monsoon rain in India. Jet stream is a strong and rapidly moving circumpolar westerly air extending up to troposphere, having meandering course. <br />The upper air westerly jet stream bifurcates into two as they flow over Indian sub-continent due to occurrence of Himalayas. The northern jet stream washes the northern Himalayas and Tibetan plateau. The southern part moves south of Himalayas in a cyclone form from west to east, bring rain and lowering the temperature of the northern Indian plain. Usually this condition last from October to February but if persist longer then hinders the arrival of monsoon in India. Low pressure develops over north-west India in the months of April and May but the upper height pressure jet stream descends down and obstructs the ascent of wind in the region of low pressure. This wind withdraws from North India by mid-June but if the condition persists these winds obstructs the upward movement of surface wind and giving no way to monsoon to arrive.\r\n&nbsp;"
