  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "In 1994, the United Nations General Assembly declared (General Assembly Resolution A/RES/49/115) June 17 the \\\"World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought\\\" to promote public awareness of the issue, and the implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in those countries experiencing serious drought and/or desertification. The First World Tsunami Awareness Day will be celebrated on November 5, 2016. To commemorate that day of “Inamura no Hi” (the burning of rice sheaves), a resolution was jointly proposed by 142 countries including Japan as a follow up of the third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The United Nations designated the 5th November as World Tsunami Awareness Day. On 20 December 2013, at 68th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), it was decided to proclaim 3 March, the day of the adoption of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), as World Wildlife Day."
