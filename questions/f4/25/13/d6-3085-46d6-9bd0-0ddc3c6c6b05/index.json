  "question": "With reference to the Australian government allowing euthanasia for the first time in decades after passing its assisted dying law, consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>Only passive euthanasia is allowed in India.</li>\n<li>Active euthanasia is illegal in all countries.</li>\n<li>Involuntary euthanasia is illegal in all countries.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?",
  "option1": "2 only",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 and 3",
  "option4": "1 only",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nIn India, passive euthanasia is allowed in certain situations. Passive euthanasia is “withdrawal of life support to patients in permanent vegetative state”. The landmark case in this field is the Aruna Shanbaug case in 2015. The Supreme Court also held the validity of “living wills” of patients to be used for permitting passive euthanasia.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nActive euthanasia is the mercy killing with the explicit permission from the terminally ill and suffering patients. It is legal in several countries like Canada, Belgium, and Netherlands etc. It is also called Voluntary Euthanasia or Physician assisted suicide (PAS). The recent case in Australia is an example of this type.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nInvoluntary euthanasia is the killing of a patient without his/ her consent. This is different from non-voluntary euthanasia where the patient is unable to give consent, possibly due to condition of vegetative state. The involuntary euthanasia is counted as murder in most countries. \n&nbsp;"
