  "question": "Consider the following statements:<br> 1. The consumption of trans fats increases the risk of coronary heart disease by raising levels of LDL cholesterol and lowering levels of HDL cholesterol<br> 2. Trans-fats cause problems in human body because they contain lesser energy and can not be used so easily<br> Which among the above is / are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "The consumption of trans fats increases the risk of coronary heart disease by raising levels of LDL cholesterol and lowering levels of &#8220;good&#8221; HDL cholesterol. Consumption of trans fat be reduced to trace amounts. Trans fats from partially hydrogenated oils are more harmful than naturally occurring oils. Trans unsaturated fats are particularly risky because the double bond stereochemistry allows the fat molecules to assume a linear conformation, which leads to efficient packing (i.e., plaque formation)."
