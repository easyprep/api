Its modified version is called the Koorai saree. It has two main types: Chettinad and Koorainad sarees. The Amrar Rajiv Gandhi Handloom Weavers Cooperative Production and Sales Society Ltd had petitioned for the listing of the saree.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:        </strong>\nThe Kandangi saree is over 200 years old. It is characterized by temple checks design in the borders. These hand-woven sarees take a week for weaving. The GI tagging will protect the original industry from duplicate products that flood the market."
