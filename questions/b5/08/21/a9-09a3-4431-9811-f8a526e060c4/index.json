  "question": "Which country has launched satellite to create world's first artificial meteor shower?",
  "option1": "India",
  "option2": "Japan",
  "option3": "Russia",
  "option4": "China",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Japan",
  "explanation": "The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has launched a rocket carrying a satellite capable of delivering an artificial meteor shower into the Earth’s atmosphere. This will be the world first artificial meteor satellite if the mission succeed.  The satellite was launched by Epsilon-4 Rocket from the JAXA Uchinoura Space Center. It is carrying the first of two micro-satellites built by Tokyo-based startup Astro Live Experiences (ALE). The satellite is set to release tiny balls from the micro-satellites in the hope of mimicking shooting stars in the night sky above Hiroshima in 2020. The process of producing such simulation is called Plasma Emission. Once the tiny ball is released in the space, it will automatically burn up to ashes so that no risk is posed to the people. The glow will be so much bright that it will be seen even through the light-polluted Tokyo city. The tiny ball is expected to shine for several seconds before being completely burned up. Apart from this tiny ball, the ALE is also looking forward to introducing disused satellites so that it will produce even brighter glows. Hence, the world’s first artificial shooting star project ‘Sky Canvas’  aims to bring people from all over the world together to witness an unprecedented, collective experience."
