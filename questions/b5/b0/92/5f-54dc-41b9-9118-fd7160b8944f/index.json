  "option2": "global economy",
  "option3": "consumer",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "consumer",
  "explanation": "Supply-side economics argues that economic growth can be most effectively generated by lowering barriers to produce goods and services. This means adjusting income tax and capital gains tax rates, and allowing greater flexibility in the production process by reducing government regulation. According to the approach, consumers will then benefit from a greater supply of goods and services which would become available at lower prices."
