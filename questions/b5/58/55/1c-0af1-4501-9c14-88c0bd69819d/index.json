  "answer": "India",
  "explanation": "The Indian women's hockey team registered a comprehensive victory over Malaysia by 4-1 in their second match of Pool A. This was the first win of the Indian team at the Gold Coast 2018 XXI Commonwealth Games campaign. Two goals from Gurjit Kaur and a goal each from skipper Rani and Lalremsiami led Indians to secure its first victory in the championship. India started the first quarter with electric pace and made chances inside the first minute itself. The team looked to press their opposition high up the pitch, which saw them regain possession quickly and make circle entries inside Malaysia's striking circle. India won three Penalty Corners in the first quarter, the last of which was converted successfully by drag-flicker Gurjit Kaur to give India a crucial lead in the 6th minute. India's defense made sure that the team maintained their lead at the end of the quarter.",
