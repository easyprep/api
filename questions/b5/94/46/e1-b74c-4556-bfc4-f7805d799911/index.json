  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: It is a new channel of investment available to FPIs to encourage them to invest in debt markets in India over and above their investments through the regular route. The objective is to attract long-term and stable FPI investments into debt markets while providing FPIs with operational flexibility to manage their investments. <br />Statement 2 and 3 are incorrect. Investments under this route as of now shall be capped at Rs 40000 crore for VRR-GOVT and 35000 crore per annum for VRR-Corporate. Investments under this route as of now shall be capped at Rs 40000 crore for VRR-GOVT and 35000 crore per annum for VRR-Corporate. But the limit could be changed from time to time based on macro-prudential considerations and assessment of investment demand. There will be separate limits for investment in government securities and investment in corporate."
