  "question": "The term “Surya Jyoti”, sometimes seen in the news, is related to which of the following?",
  "option1": "Reusable Nuclear Powered Aircraft Carrier",
  "option2": "Photo-Voltaic Integrated Micro Solar Dome",
  "option3": "Electric Plane",
  "option4": "DEMU Solar-Powered Train",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Photo-Voltaic Integrated Micro Solar Dome",
  "explanation": "Surya Jyoti is a Photo-Voltaic Integrated Micro Solar Dome which has been developed under the aegis of Department of Science and Technology. It is billed as world’s first hybrid device with the illumination level of the light going as high as a 15W LED bulb. It is different to conventional solar devices which do not capture passive energy and work through storage battery. Surya Jyoti is a hybrid device and it utilizes both active as well as passive solar energy. The micro solar dome captures sunlight through a transparent semi spherical upper dome and concentrates it inside a dark room, thus, utilizing passive energy during day time and not using the battery or the solar panels. During night, when sunlight is not available it utilizes the battery storage with photovoltaic (PV), which is called active energy. So this combination provides 18 hours of light – active six hours and passive 12 hours. Surya-Jyoti- Photo-Voltaic (PV) Integrated Micro Solar Dome (MSD) is thus a day and night lighting single device that has a transparent semi-spherical upper dome and lower dome made of acrylic material."
