  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe third battle of Panipat was fought between the Maratha Empire and the Durrani Empire. It was fought in the 18<sup>th</sup> century and is noted as one of the largest battle in that period. It resulted in the defeat of the Marathas.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Third battle of Panipat was fought in modern day Haryana. The distance of the battlefield from the Maratha capital Pune is one of the reasons for the Marathaâ€™s defeat. Also, the Afghan forces greatly outnumbered the Maratha forces leading to high casualties."
