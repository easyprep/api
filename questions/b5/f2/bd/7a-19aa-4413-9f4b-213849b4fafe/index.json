  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nArticle 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is the most significant component of the legal document. It provides that a military attack on one of the NATO members counts as an attack against them all. It was invoked only once and that was by the USA. This was after the 9/11 terrorist attack.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe North Atlantic Treaty is also known as the Washington Treaty. It was signed in Washington, D.C. on April 4<sup>th</sup>, 1949. The treaty forms the legal basis for the foundation of NATO which is the largest military alliance in the world. Its current membership stands at 29 countries."
