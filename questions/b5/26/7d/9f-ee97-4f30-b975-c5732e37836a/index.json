The panchayats could be dissolved before the expiry of five years only in accordance with the law, if any, promulgated by the state. In case of dissolution of a panchayat, a fresh election was to be completed within a period of six months from the date of dissolution and the newly elected members should hold office only for the remaining part of the term and not for the full term of five years.&nbsp;"
