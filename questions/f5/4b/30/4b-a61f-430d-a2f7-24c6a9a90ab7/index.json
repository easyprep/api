  "question": "In context with the recent discussions about the role of Ghaggar- Hakra valley in the Indus Valley Civilisation, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>River Ghaggar is a perennial river.</li>\n<li>It drains into the Arabian Sea.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nRiver Ghaggar is an intermittent river i.e. one of the non-perennial rivers of north India. It is fed by monsoon rains and flows only during the monsoon seasons. Its two parts are called Khadir and Bangar. The Khadir region is more flood prone than the Bangar region.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Ghaggar River is an endorheic river. This means that its drainage is limited and does not flow into other major water body like an ocean. Mature and Late Harappan Civilisation sites occur along its course. The monsoons were more prominent during these times but gradually declined."
