  "question": "Which country houses the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Wartburg Castle\"?",
  "option1": "Germany",
  "option2": "France",
  "option3": "Belgium",
  "option4": "Netherlands",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Germany",
  "explanation": "Germany houses the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Wartburg Castle\". Wartburg Castle blends superbly into its forest surroundings and is in many ways \"the ideal castle\". Although it contains some sections of great antiquity, it acquired the current layout over the course of 19th-century reconstructions. This renewal of interest was justified by its symbolic nature for the German people, and today the castle continues to be a symbol of the nation's past and present. Its current state is a splendid example of what this fortress might have been at the peak of its military and seigneurial power. Wartburg Castle is perched at a height of some 400 m above the delightful countryside, south of the city of Eisenach in Thuringia in central Germany."
