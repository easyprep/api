  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 and 3",
  "option4": "1 only",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 only",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe 2019 amendment bill is to replace the 1951 act. The act had led to the formation of the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust. The trust is to manage the memorial for the 1919 massacre in Amritsar. The incident occurred on Baisakhi/ Punjabi New Year and is one of the landmark incidents of Indian Freedom Struggle.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe original act had called for the inclusion of the CM of Punjab in the Trust that manages the memorial. The bill does not alter this. The bill removes the provision for including the president of Indian National Congress as a trustee. The bill also provides for terminating the nominated members (3) of the Trust prior to the end of tenure without assigning any reason.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe original act had called for including the Leader of Opposition as a trustee. The bill only clarifies that in the absence of such a member, the trustee post will be given to the leader of the single largest opposition party. To claim the official position, the party will have had to win 10% of the Lok Sabha seats."
