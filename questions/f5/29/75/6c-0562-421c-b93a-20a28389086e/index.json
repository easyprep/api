  "explanation": "Pakistan has become the first country in the world to introduce WHO-approved Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine (TCV) Â into its routine immunisation programme through a campaign mode in Sindh. Its an effort to combat a drug-resistant strain of the potentially fatal disease in the Sindh province. The two-week campaign has been launched with the support of Geneva-based Gavi vaccine alliance. The TCV is a one-dose vaccine, injected intramuscularly, that is lower in cost and has higher efficacy. It is expected to provide long lasting immunity in adults, children and infants older than 9 months of age. Typhoid is a highly contagious disease that spreads quickly when people live in crowded neighbourhoods with weak water and sanitation infrastructure."
