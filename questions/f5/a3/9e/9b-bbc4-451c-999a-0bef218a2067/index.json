  "option1": 1907,
  "option2": 1908,
  "option3": 1910,
  "option4": 1912,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 1908,
  "explanation": "Through his paper ‘Kesari’, Tilak defended the revolutionaries Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki, and called for immediate Swaraj or self-rule. The Government charged him with sedition. Tilak was sentenced to a six years (1908-14) in jail in Mandalay, Burma. Mohammad Ali Jinnah was Tilak’s lawyer. Although Jinnah lost the case, he successfully defended Tilak in 1916 when Tilak was charged with sedition. While in the prison Tilak wrote the ‘Gita Rahasya’. Sale proceeds from that hugely popular book were donated for the Indian Independence movement. However, the life in Mandalay prison severely affected Tilak’s health."
