  "question": "In a bid to promote the use of clean fuel across the country, the oil ministry has recently proposed investing Rs.7000 crore in setting up bio-CNG plants and allied infrastructure. In this context, consider the following statements: <ol> <li>Bio-CNG is a purified form of biogas with methane concentration varied in the range of 50 to 70%</li> <li>India’s first Bio-CNG plant has been recently inaugurated at Amritsar in Punjab</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect.</u> Bio-CNG is a purified form of biogas with over 95% pure methane-gas. It is similar to natural gas in its composition (97% methane) and energy potential. While natural gas is a fossil fuel, bio-CNG is a renewable form of energy produced from agricultural and food waste. Bio-CNG is being looked at as an environment-friendly alternative to diesel. It is produced from agricultural waste and plant materials. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u> because India’s first Bio-CNG plant has been inaugurated at Pune in Maharashtra. Primove Engineering Pvt. Ltd, a clean tech company, based in Pune has built India’s first Bio-CNG plant where Bio-CNG is made using agricultural waste. The recently proposed project by oil ministry will be implemented with the help of Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd are the state-run oil marketing companies that the oil ministry will team up with to implement the plan. India’s first indigenously made Bio-CNG plant is located at Durgapura in Jaipur."
