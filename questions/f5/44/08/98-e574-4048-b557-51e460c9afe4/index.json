  "question": "Consider the following differences between Wi-Fi and WiMAX: <ol> <li>Wi-Fi signal range is lower than that of WiMAX</li> <li>Wi-Fi network exchange rate is generally lower than that of WiMAX</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "WiMAX is the acronym for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access. It is a wireless microwave MAN technology that provides up to 1 Gbit/s as far as 30 miles away. It is similar to Wi-Fi technology, except that it can provide much higher data transfer rates. While an ideal Wi-Fi based network reaches around 100metres as it maximum range, an ideal WiMAX network can reach about 80-90kilometers in terms of range. While Wi-Fi based networking can transfer data at speeds up to 54mbps, WiMAX networks exchange data at speeds upto 40mbps. In WiMAX, data transfer rates have more variation as distances to be covered are quite larger. The name “WiMAX”, also known as IEEE 802.16, was created by the IEEE Forum which was founded in June 2001. The original WiMAX 802.16d standard was published in 2004 and it is called Fixed WiMAX while the 802.16e standard was published in 2005 and it is called Mobile WiMAX."
