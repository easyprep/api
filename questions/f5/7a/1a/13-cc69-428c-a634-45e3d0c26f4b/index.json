  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Himalayan region is more prone to landslides than the Western Ghats region. This is because the Himalayas are geologically younger and more active. They have high levels of seismic and tectonic activity which act as triggers for landslides.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Geological Survey of India is the nodal agency for dealing with landslides. It was declared so in 2004. As a part of its responsibilities, the GSI investigates landslides and also frames mitigation measures for all types of landslides, implement the action plan, etc."
