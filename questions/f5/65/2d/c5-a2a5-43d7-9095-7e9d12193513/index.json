  "question": "At which among the following sessions, the All India Muslim league passed the Pakistan Resolution on 23 March 1940?",
  "option1": "Karachi",
  "option2": "Hyderabad",
  "option3": "Lahore",
  "option4": "Lucknow",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Lahore",
  "explanation": "The Pakistan demand was formalised gradually. On 23 March 1940, the League moved a resolution demanding a measure of autonomy for the Muslim majority areas of the subcontinent. This ambiguous resolution never mentioned partition or Pakistan\r\nThe name Pakistan or Pak-stan (from Punjab, Afghan, Kashmir, Sind and Baluchistan) was coined by a Punjabi Muslim student at Cambridge, Choudhry Rehmat Ali, who, in pamphlets written in 1933 and 1935, desired a separate national status for this new entity."
