  "answer": "Birbal",
  "explanation": "Din-i-Illahi was an eclectic doctrine that contained elements from very diverse fields. It overthrew almost every ceremonial rule whether Islam or Muslim, but took the good ideas from the Brahmins as well as from the missionaries and adopted “Sun” as a symbol of the worship of the creator. He started a new Illahi era. The new cult was immediately professed by a small band of the courtiers of Akbar including Faizi, Abul Fazal, Birbal and a few others."
