  "question": "Which of the following is correct about acceleration due to gravity?",
  "option1": "it increases with depth",
  "option2": "it decreases with depth",
  "option3": "it is independent of depth",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "it decreases with depth",
  "explanation": "The value of acceleration due to gravity decreases with depth. g<sub>0</sub>= g(1-d/R) where d is the depth below the centre of the earth."
