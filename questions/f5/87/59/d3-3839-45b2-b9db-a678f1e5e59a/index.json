  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "<strong>A P2P lending platform is a virtual marketplace where actual lenders meet actual borrowers.</strong> This is a correct statement. <strong>P2P lending platforms in India come under the purview of RBI regulations</strong> This is a correct statement. Earlier there were no regulations but in September 2017, RBI notified that the P2P lending platforms would need to be registered as non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). <strong>Only scheduled commercial banks in India are allowed to engage in P2P lending</strong> This is incorrect. P2P lending entities need to register themselves as NBFCs."
