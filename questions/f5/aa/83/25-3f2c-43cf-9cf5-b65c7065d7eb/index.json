  "explanation": "The E - Horizon is an older layer usually found between the A-horizon and the B-horizon. It is a light coloured eluviated layer, that is eroded of its nutrients. It underwent significant leaching which took away the nutrients like iron, aluminium, clay etc., leaving behind resistant, undissolvable materials like quartz, sand, and silt."
