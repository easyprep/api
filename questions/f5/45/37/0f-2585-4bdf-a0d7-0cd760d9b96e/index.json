  "explanation": "Georgia's popular tourist attraction is \"Batumi Botanical Garden\". The Batumi Botanical Garden is located in the city of Batumi, capital of Autonomous Republic of Adjara, Georgia. Located at the place called Mtsvane Kontskhi (\"The Green Cape\") on the Black Sea shore, it is one of the largest botanical gardens in the former Soviet Union. The Batumi Botanical Garden was started by the Russian botanist Andrey Nikolayevich Krasnov (1862-1914), in the 1880s and officially opened on November 3, 1912. Under the Soviet Union, the garden was further expanded and developed, since 1925, into a principal institution for the study of Caucasian maritime subtropical cultures. Currently, the garden consists of nine floristic sectors, those of Caucasian humid subtropics, East Asia, New Zealand, South America, the Himalayas, Mexico, Australia, and of the Mediterranean."
