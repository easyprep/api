  "question": "Consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>In comparison to sea water, the speed of sound is greater in freshwater</li>\r\n<li>In comparison to shallow depths, the speed of sound is greater in Deep Ocean</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above is / are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "Sea water is salt water , denser than the plane water so naturally the speed of sound will be HIGHER than that of normal fresh water. In Oceans, the speed of sound will depend mainly upon depth (pressure) , temperature of water as well as salinity. While we go down towards Ocean beds, the temperature decreases with depth while pressure and generally salinity increase. So, in that case, sound speed will follow a curve which decreases to a minimum at a depth of few hundred meters, then increases again with increasing depth."
