  "question": "Bihar has planned to establish another tiger reserve after Valmiki reserve. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The new reserve is to come up in the Kaimur forests.</li>\n<li>Valmiki reserve is the only tiger reserve in Bihar.</li>\n<li>India’s saturation level for tigers is 3,000.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe second reserve is to come up in the Kaimur forest of Bihar. It is also the site of Kaimur Wildlife Sanctuary. The officials are already working to improve that habitat to favour tiger population. The region has been assigned a divisional forest officer. After sufficient work is completed, the state will seek centre’s declaration of the region as a reserve.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:        </strong>\nValmiki Tiger Reserve is the only tiger reserve in the state. It is one of the better performing reserves according to the Tiger Census. The government has been in works to develop a grassland to help the tiger population. The reserve is about to reach its saturation point in tiger population.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nThe recent tiger census showed that the tiger numbers are increasing in India. The country is close to achieving its goal of doubling tiger numbers (under the 2010 St Petersburg declaration). However, a new problem in the form of population saturation is emerging. Tigers are territorial animals and given India’s tiger reserve area, it can support only about 3,000 individuals."
