Her research topics included Teichmuller theory, hyperbolic geometry, ergodic theory, and symplectic geometry. In 2005, as a result of her research, she was honoured in Popular Science's fourth annual \"Brilliant 10\" in which she was acknowledged as one of the top 10 young minds who have pushed their fields in innovative directions. On 13 August 2014, Mirzakhani was honoured with the Fields Medal, the most prestigious award in mathematics. Thus, she became both the first and to date, the only woman and the first Iranian to be honoured with the award. The award committee cited her work in \"the dynamics and geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces\".",
