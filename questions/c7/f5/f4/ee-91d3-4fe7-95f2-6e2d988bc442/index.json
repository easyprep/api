  "answer": 1960,
  "explanation": "From the mid-17th century to the mid-19th century Portuguese empire had a colonial presence in Benin. The Portuguese empire was engaged in the massive slave trade with Benin. This continued till the abolition of slavery through the Slave Trade Act, 1807 which weakened Benin's (previously Dahomey) status. This lead to the emergence of French power in Benin's soil during the mid-19th century. And finally, due to the anti-colonial stand of Beninese during the later years, France was forced to give independence to Benin in 1960."
