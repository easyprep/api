  "question": "Most of the meteoroids that enter into Earth’s Atmosphere, get burnt into which among the following layers?",
  "option1": "Ionosphere",
  "option2": "Mesosphere",
  "option3": "Stratosphere",
  "option4": "Troposphere",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Mesosphere",
  "explanation": "The mesosphere extends from the stratopause to 80–85 km. Please note that most meteoroids get burnt in this layer. Temperature decreases with height in the mesosphere. The mesopause, the temperature minimum that marks the top of the mesosphere, is the coldest place around Earth and has an average temperature around −85 °C . At the mesopause, temperatures may drop to −100 °C."
