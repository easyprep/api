  "answer": "Adhvaryu",
  "explanation": "Adhvaryu In the operational aspects of Vedic fire rites, the Adhvaryu was a central figure because he was the one who measured the sacrificial ground, built all that was needed and prepared materials to be used like, articles of oblation, utensils, woods and water. He also kindled the fire for expected offerings. Thus, success of a Yajna was dependent on correct duties of the Adhvaryu priest."
