  "option1": "Pargana",
  "option2": "Prants",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Mauzas",
  "explanation": "Shivaji's empire was divided into sixteen parts for the purpose of collecting the revenue. These sixteen parts were further divided into tarfs and each tarf was further subdivided into mauzs / mauzas. The revenue officer of a province was called the subedar while the officer in a tarf was called the karkun. Thus, during the rule of Shivaji the Mauzas or villages were the lowest unit of administration. The police officer in rural area was known as Faujdar and in urban area was called Kotwal. The Maratha Kingdom was also known as Swarajya or Mulk-e-Kadim."
