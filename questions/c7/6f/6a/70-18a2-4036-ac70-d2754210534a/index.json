  "question": "The reproduction where only one parent passes genes to the offspring is known as __?",
  "option1": "Epimixis",
  "option2": "Apomixis",
  "option3": "Pseudogamy",
  "option4": "Parthenocarpy",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Apomixis",
  "explanation": "Apomixis is reproduction where only one parent passes genes to the offspring. Apomictically produced offspring are genetically identical to the parent (clones). The method is most seen in plants, especially flowering plants. Brambles (blackberry) are apomictic. Some authorities give &#8220;reproduction by special tissues without fertilisation&#8221;, or &#8220;asexual formation of a seed from the maternal tissues of the ovule, avoiding meiosis and fertilization, leading to embryo development&#8221;.
