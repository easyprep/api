  "option1": "2 per cent",
  "option2": "3 per cent",
  "option3": "4 per cent",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "3 per cent",
  "explanation": "The Reserve Bank of India recently directed all banks to extend the benefit of interest subvention and prompt repayment incentive to short term crop loans, to the accounts which have become due or will become due between March and May 2020. \r\nThe government offers an interest subvention of two percent per annum to banks and an additional 3 per cent interest subvention to farmers who pay their loans promptly. Hence the effective rate of interest is 4 per cent."
