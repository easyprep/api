Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik flagged off 'Ama Gaon, Ama Vikas' video vans. These video vans will move across Odisha and will highlight various welfare schemes of Government. Through the Wi-fi enabled video walls in these vans, people would be able to send their grievances directly to the Chief Ministers' Office Secretariat in Bhubaneswar. Odisha State Government believes that this initiative will help in solving people's grievances instantly.",
