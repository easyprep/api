  "question": "Which of the following factors affect the Surface Tension?",
  "option1": "Nature of liquid",
  "option2": "Area of Surface",
  "option3": "Both a and b",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Nature of liquid",
  "explanation": "The Surface tension depends only on the nature of liquid and is independent of the area of surface or length of line considered. Surface tension of a liquid is measured by the force acting per unit length on either side of an imaginary line drawn on the free surface of liquid."
