The oasis boasts over 500 hot springs, including Bir Tarfawi and Bir Al-Gebel Hot Spring, as well as charming mud-brick housing and ruins in the medieval town and village of Al-Qasr and Balat. Dakhla is organized around the main town of Mut, a settlement that dates back to pharaonic times. Although Mut has evolved into a modern touristic hub, we can still see today the remnants of the old town."
