  "answer": "Bengaluru",
  "explanation": "Tech giant Microsoft has inked its first renewable energy deal in India for powering its new facility in Bengaluru. The facility, which will be operational from June 2018, is spread over 5.85 lakh square feet. The agreement will see Microsoft purchase 3 megawatts of solar-powered electricity from Atria Power to help power its new office building in Bangalore. This will meet 80% of the projected electricity needs at the new facility. This deal is part of Karnataka government program to encourage investments in local solar energy operations, in line with the country’s goal of ramping up solar power generation to 100 gigawatts by 2022. Once completed, the project will bring Microsoft’s total global direct procurement in renewable energy projects to nearly 900 megawatts. This is Microsoft’s first solar energy agreement in India, and one of the first ones in the Asian region."
