  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Ecuador",
  "explanation": "The UNESCO World Heritage Site Sangay National Park is located in Morona, Santiago, Chimborazo and Tungurahua provinces of Ecuador. With its outstanding natural beauty and two active volcanoes, this national park illustrates the entire spectrum of ecosystems, ranging from tropical rainforests to glaciers, with striking contrasts between the snowcapped peaks and the forests of the plains. Its isolation has encouraged the survival of indigenous species such as the mountain tapir and the Andean condor. The Sangay National Park illustrates within its 270,000 hectares the entire spectrum of ecosystems of Ecuador. These include glacial and volcanic ecosystems, cloud forests, Amazon rainforest, wetlands, lakes, and the fragile moorlands (p√°ramos) and grasslands of the highlands. Geologically, this area is especially important due to the presence of the Sangay volcano, which at 5,140m in altitude is one of the more active volcanoes in the world."
