  "option4": "1, 2, 3, 4 & 5",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3, 4 & 5",
  "explanation": "Magnetic lines of force are closed continuous curves in a magnetic field along which the north pole will move if free to do so and its direction is given by the direction in which free north pole will point. The five points given in this questions are its notable properties."
