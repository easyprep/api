  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 only",
  "explanation": "Statement 1 is incorrect. The PRAGATI (Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation) is a unique integrating and interactive platform. The platform is aimed at addressing common manâ€˜s grievances, and simultaneously monitoring and reviewing important programmes and projects of the Government of India as well as projects flagged by State Governments. Statement 2 is correct. The PRAGATI platform uniquely bundles three latest technologies: Digital data management, videoconferencing and geo- spatial technology. It also offers a unique combination in the direction of cooperative federalism since it brings on one stage the Secretaries of Government of India and the Chief Secretaries of the States. A built-in feature of PRAGATI is that the directions given by the Prime Minister remain in the system for further follow up and review till the finality of the matter."
