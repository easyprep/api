  "option3": "Minerva Mills Ltd. and others case",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Golaknath case",
  "explanation": "The judgement reversed Supreme Court\\'s earlier decision which had upheld Parliament\\'s power to amend all parts of the Constitution, including Part III related to Fundamental Rights. The judgement left Parliament with no power to curtail Fundamental Rights. <br />Parliament passed the 24th Amendment in 1971 to abrogate the Supreme Court judgement. It amended the Constitution to provide expressly that Parliament has the power to amend any part of the Constitution including the provisions relating to Fundamental Rights. This was done by amending articles 13 and 368 to exclude amendments made under article 368, from article 13\\'s prohibition of any law abridging or taking away any of the Fundamental Rights.<br />\r\n&nbsp;"
