The idea was not sold to the British, but in 1905, along with Byomkesh Mustafi, an attempt was made to bring out a detailed blue print of this programme which apart from other things such as promotion of Swadeshi Arts and crafts, Gyms, Dispensaries etc. the plan was to launch Bangla Medium schools."
