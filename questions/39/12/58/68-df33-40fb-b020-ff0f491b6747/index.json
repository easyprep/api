  "question": "Water does not fall out of a glass when it is inverted inside a satellite, which is orbiting very close to the earth’s surface. Which of the following is the best reason for this?",
  "option1": "The earth does not exert any force on the water",
  "option2": "The earth’s force of attraction on the water is exactly balanced by the force created by the satellites",
  "option3": "The water and the glass have the same acceleration due to gravity",
  "option4": "The gravitational attraction between the glass and the water balances the earth’s attraction on the",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "The water and the glass have the same acceleration due to gravity",
  "explanation": "Water does not fall out of a glass when it is inverted inside a satellite, which is orbiting very close to the earth’s surface. The reason for this is that the water and the glass have the same acceleration due to gravity, equal to g, towards the centre of the earth. Hence there is no relative motion between them."
