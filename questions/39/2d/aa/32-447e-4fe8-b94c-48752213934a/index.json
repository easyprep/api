  "question": "Which one of the following elements is alloyed with iron to produce steel which can resist high temperatures and also have high hardness and abrasion resistance?",
  "option1": "Aluminium",
  "option2": "Chromium",
  "option3": "Nickel",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Chromium",
  "explanation": "Chromium is a chemical element with the symbol Cr and atomic number 24. It is the first element in group 6. It is a steely-grey, lustrous, hard and brittle transition metal. Chromium is the main additive in stainless steel, to which it adds anti-corrosive properties. Chromium is moderately resistant to oxidation but absorbs nitrogen from air and loses structural stability."
