  "question": "Which of the following is / are advantages of the Solar Energy in comparison to the traditional energy sources?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Solar electrical power generation has the highest power density among all the renewable energy sources</li>\r\n<li>Solar energy is clean, sustainable and doesnâ€™t let out carbon dioxide</li>\r\n<li>Solar electricity is presently cheaper than the electricity given by other sources</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3 are correct",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "The initial cost is very high. Means the installing costs can get costly, usually due to the high-cost semiconductor materials, which are used to build a solar energy system. Solar electricity is presently costlier than the electricity given by other sources. Naturally as energy shortages are becoming common day-by-day, solar energy is thus becoming more price-competitive. Kindly, also note that a Considerable amount of energy is lost when DC (direct current) has to be converted to AC (alternating current). The solar cells can only produce DC, thus the conversion by help of Grid-Tie Inverters incurs a loss of about 4-12%."
