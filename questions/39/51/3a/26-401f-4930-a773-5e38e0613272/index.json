  "question": "What is the slope of the velocity-time graph when an object moves with constant negative acceleration, having positive initial velocity?",
  "option1": "90°",
  "option2": "more than 90°",
  "option3": "less than 90°",
  "option4": "0°",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "more than 90°",
  "explanation": "When an object moves with constant negative acceleration, having positive initial velocity, the velocity-time graph is a straight line having slope more than 90°. When an object moves with constant positive acceleration, having positive initial velocity, the velocity-time graph is a straight line having slope less than 90°."
