  "question": "Which of the following pathways is related to translocation of water in plants?",
  "option1": "Symplastic",
  "option2": "Apoplastic",
  "option3": "Both 1 and 2",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2",
  "explanation": "Translocation in vascular plants means the movement of water, organic molecules and some mineral ions from leaves to other tissues throught the plant. In apoplastic transport, water and minerals flow in an upward direction via the apoplast to the xylem in the root. The symplast of a plant is the inner side of the plasma membrane in which water and low- molecular-weight solutes can freely diffuse."
