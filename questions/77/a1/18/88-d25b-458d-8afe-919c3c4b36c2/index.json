  "question": "&nbsp; Consider the following statements about Phytomining: <ol> <li>It is a way to mine plants for chemicals that can be used for manufacturing and industrial purposes</li> <li>This method has been used worldwide in recent years primarily to harvest germanium</li> </ol> &nbsp; Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Both are correct statements<br> Phytomining is a way to mine plants for chemicals that can be used for manufacturing and industrial purposes. It is the production of a `crop&#039; of a metal by growing high-biomass plants that accumulate high metal concentrations. Phytomining is possible for a range of metals. In recent years Phytomining has been used primarily to harvest germanium, an important metalloid component used in computers, smart phones and fiber-optic cables."
