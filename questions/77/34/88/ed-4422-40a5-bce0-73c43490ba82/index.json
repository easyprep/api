  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe term eco-anxiety is being used increasing in context with the Greta Thunberg’s talk on climate change action. It is the agitation, anxiety or depression caused due to concerns for the state of the environment- in the present and in the future.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nIt is not recognised as a medical condition by WHO. It does not cause any major health effects. Instead, experts say that it could be beneficial as it may drive more people to take responsible action against climate change."
