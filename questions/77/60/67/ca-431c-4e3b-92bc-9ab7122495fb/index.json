  "question": "Which state government will set up \"Book Banks\" in schools to provide old books to needy students?",
  "option1": "Madhya Pradesh",
  "option2": "Rajasthan",
  "option3": "Punjab",
  "option4": "Uttar Pradesh",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Punjab",
  "explanation": "The Punjab government will launch an innovative scheme  “Book Banks” in all schools of the state so that needy students will get the books for their academic year free of cost. These book banks will request students to deposit their old books so that the needy students in the next batch can use them free of cost. The scheme will help the needy save money and it will also reduce costs and environmental damage associated with printing new books. Though, this unique initiative will be purely on voluntary basis and no student would be bound to give away their old books. NGOs that have been running similar schemes will help the government in the implementation process."
