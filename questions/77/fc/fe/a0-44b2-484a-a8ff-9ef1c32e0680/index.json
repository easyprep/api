  "option1": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 2",
  "option4": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "The President can call joint sessions of the parliament if a bill passed by one House is rejected by the other House or if the amendments proposed to a bill by one House are not acceptable to the other House, does not take any action on a bill remitted to it for six months. The deadlock over a bill in a joint sitting is resolved by present and voting. Since the Lok Sabha has a larger membership in a joint sitting generally the will of the Lok Sabha prevails. After the passage of the bill in a joint sitting it is presented to the President for his assent. But no joint sitting can be summoned to resolve a deadlock in case of a Money bill or a Constitutional Amendment bill."
