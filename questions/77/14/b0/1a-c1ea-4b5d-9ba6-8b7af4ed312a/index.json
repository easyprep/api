  "option1": 1918,
  "option2": 1919,
  "option3": 1920,
  "option4": 1921,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 1920,
  "explanation": "The Chamber of Princes representing the Princely States was established in 1920. The Chamber usually met once a year presided by the Viceroy. The full Chamber used to elect from within its princely ranks a permanent officer styled the Chancellor, who chaired the Standing Committee of the Chamber, which used to meet more often. The last Chancellor during 1944–47 was the Nawab of Bhopal Sir Hamidullah Khan. This Chamber of Princes was among the major fault-lines forged by the British to ensure their continuance through their “divide & rule” policy."
