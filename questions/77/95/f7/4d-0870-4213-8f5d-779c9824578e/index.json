  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "Switzerland has not joined EU nor EEA. The reason is that the people out there think that they can manage at their own. Switzerland had discussed in 1992 to accede to European Economic Area but then in a referendum in the country, the people out there voted that they don’t want EEA membership. The government decided to suspend the discussions regarding both EU as well as EEA. Almost same reason applies to Norway too. The other reason is that the Swiss people don’t think that EU is here to stay."
