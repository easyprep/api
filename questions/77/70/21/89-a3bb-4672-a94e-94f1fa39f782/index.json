  "question": "Which two water bodies are connected by the \"Strait of Dover\"?",
  "option1": "English Channel and North Sea",
  "option2": "Sea of Marmara and Black Sea",
  "option3": "Gulf of Bothnia and Baltic Sea",
  "option4": "Red Sea and Mediterranean Sea",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "English Channel and North Sea",
  "explanation": "Strait of Dover, also known as the Dover Strait or the Dover Narrows, is a naturally formed narrow navigable waterway located in the Atlantic Ocean that connects the English Channel to the North Sea, thereby separates Great Britain from continental Europe. The entire strait is located between and within the territorial waters of France and the United Kingdom, but a right of transit passage under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) exists allowing unrestricted shipping. Most maritime traffic between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea and Baltic sea passes through the Strait of Dover, rather than taking the longer and more dangerous route around the north of Scotland."
