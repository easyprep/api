  "option3": "2 & 3",

  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "There are two systems , one is allocation based and another is demand driven. Allocation based can be also called supply driven. The Demand driven implies that:<br />1. The scheme implementation is driven from below by the grassroots institutions of poor.<br />2. The planning will be highly decentralised<br />3. It is driven by the institutions such as PRIs, SHGs etc.<br />Under NREGA, the jobs are demand driven. Under NRLM also, a demand driven strategy is adopted. States have the flexibility to develop their action plans for poverty reduction which will include a 7 year Perspective Plan and a detailed Annual Action Plan. The overall plan will be within the allocation for the state based on inter-se poverty ratios."
