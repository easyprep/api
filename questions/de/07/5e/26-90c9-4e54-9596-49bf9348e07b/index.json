  "question": "A and B can complete a piece of work in 30 days, B and C in 20 days while C and A in 15 days. If all of them work together, the time taken in completing the work will be :",
  "option1": "$latex 10\\ days$",
  "option2": "$latex 12\\ days$",
  "option3": "$latex 12\\frac{2}{3}\\ days&s=1$",
  "option4": "$latex 13\\frac{1}{3}\\ days&s=1$",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "$latex 13\\frac{1}{3}\\ days&s=1$",
  "explanation": "Work done by (A + B) in 1 day $latex = \\\\frac{1}{30}&s=1$\r\nWork done by (B + C) in 1 day $latex = \\\\frac{1}{20}&s=1$\r\nWork done by (C + A) in 1 day $latex = \\\\frac{1}{15}&s=1$\r\nOn adding, \r\nWork done by 2(A + B + C) in 1 day $latex = \\\\frac{1}{30}+\\\\frac{1}{20}+\\\\frac{1}{15} = \\\\frac{3}{20}&s=1$\r\n∴ Work done by (A + B + C) in 1 day $latex = \\\\frac{3}{40}&s=1$\r\n∴ (A + B + C) will do the work in $latex \\\\frac{40}{3} = 13\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\ days&s=1$\r\nHence option [D] is correct answer."
