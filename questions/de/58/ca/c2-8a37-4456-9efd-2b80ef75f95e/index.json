  "answer": "Rukhmabai",
  "explanation": "&nbsp; Rukhmabai was born on 22 Nov, 1864 in Bombay. She was the only daughter of Janardhan Pandurang and Jayantibai. She lost her father when she was eight years old and was married off at the age of 11 to Dadaji Bhikaji. She was one among the first Indian women to practice medicine in colonial India. Rukhmabai refused to move in with her husband stating that a woman cannot be compelled to stay in wedlock when she is not interested. The Dadaji vs. Rukhmabai case that went on for three years triggered a debate in both England and India. This prompted the government to bring the Age of Consent Act, 1891, despite opposition from conservative Indians. In 1888, after separating from her husband, she moved to England to study medicine. She returned to India in 1894 and practised in Surat, Rajkot, and Bombay for the next 35 years. She passed away on September 25, 1955."
