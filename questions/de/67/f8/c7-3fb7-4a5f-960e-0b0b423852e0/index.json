  "question": "What will be the general value of angle of contact when the liquid does not wet the solid?",
  "option1": "acute",
  "option2": "obtuse",
  "option3": "zero",
  "option4": "90Â°",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "obtuse",
  "explanation": "When angle of contact is an obtuse angle then molecules of liquids are attracted strongly to themselves and weakly to those of solid, it costs a lot of energy to create a liquid-solid surface, and liquid then does not wet the solid. For example: water on a waxy or oily surface."
