  "question": "Consider the following statements about the Waves and Instabilities from a Neutral Dynamo (WINDY) Mission: <ol> <li>The mission is an initiative by NASA</li> <li>It aims to conduct a deep study of seismic wave generated by an impulse such as an earthquake or an explosion</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is correct</u>. <u>Second statement is incorrect </u>because the mission aims to study the disturbances in ionosphere that hampers the communication and technology systems. Under the mission, scientists aim to create white artificial clouds in ionosphere. These clouds will glow even in the night sky and will help to understand the reasons for such instability in the plasma layer. The Equatorial Spread-F (ESF) phenomenon is recorded in ionograms (graph formed by ionosonde, special radar for the examination of the ionosphere). This graph shows the plasma instabilities in the F-layer of the equatorial ionosphere. This instability is responsible for the disturbance in radio communication. The scientists have chosen Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands as the place for observing mission. <strong>About the Mission</strong> The WINDY mission consists of two NASA suborbital sounding rockets to be launched from the island of Roi-Namur. The first rocket will carry tri-methyl aluminium (TMA) and Lithium. While TMA will react spontaneously on contact with oxygen to produce a pale white visible cloud from the ground, sunlight reflected by the Moon will illuminate lithium producing an emission that will be detected by the cameras equipped with narrow-band filters. The second rocket, a two-stage 36-foot long Terrier-Malemute, will carry instruments to measure ionosphere densities and electric and magnetic fields present in these storms. These disturbances occur after sunset at latitudes near the equator in part of the ionosphere. And since the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands is near the magnetic equator, it makes the site an ideal location for these studies."
