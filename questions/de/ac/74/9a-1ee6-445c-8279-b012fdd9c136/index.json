An unmanned cargo vessel smashed into the Russian Mir space station today during a practice docking in the most serious collision ever involving a manned spacecraft.<br />The impact sent Mir reeling, knocked out much of its power supply and punctured part of the space station, forcing the two Russians and an American on board to scramble to seal off a compartment. Space officials said the astronauts were not injured and were in no immediate danger.<br />The collision prompted searching questions about the safety of Mir, the jewel of the once-proud Russian space program and a prominent symbol of American and Russia cooperation in space."
