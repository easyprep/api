  "question": "What is the India’s growth rate for FY19, as per latest IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO) Report?",
  "option1": 0.073,
  "option2": 0.074,
  "option3": 0.075,
  "option4": 0.076,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 0.073,
  "explanation": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted a growth rate of 7.3% for India in FY19 and 7.4% in FY20.  In 2017, India had clocked a 6.7% growth rate. The latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) Report has predicted a slightly lower growth rate than it made projections in the April 2018 WEO for 2019. The prediction is lower due to recent increase in oil prices and the tightening of global financial conditions. The report said, in India, important reforms have been implemented in recent years, including the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the inflation-targeting framework, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), and steps to liberalise foreign investment and make it easier to do business. India\\'s medium-term growth prospects remain strong at 7.75%, benefiting from ongoing structural reform. If the projections are true, then India will regain the tag of the fastest growing major economies of the world, crossing China with more than 0.7 percentage point in 2018 and an impressive 1.2 percentage point growth lead in 2019."
