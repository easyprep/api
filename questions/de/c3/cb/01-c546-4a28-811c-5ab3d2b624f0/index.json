  "question": "Which of the following element has the highest first ionization enthalpy?",
  "option1": "Magnesium",
  "option2": "Strontium",
  "option3": "Beryllium",
  "option4": "Barium",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Beryllium",
  "explanation": "The alkaline earth metals have low ionization enthalpies due to fairly large size of the atoms. Since the atomic size increases down the group, their ionization enthalpy decreases."
