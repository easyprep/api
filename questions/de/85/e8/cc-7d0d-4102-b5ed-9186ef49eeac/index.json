  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "Some key notes about Hydrogen:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Hydrogen does not occur in free state in atmosphere. Hydrogen is a vital constituent of all the compounds which are known in animal and plant kingdom.</li>\r\n<li>Hydrogen can be prepared by the action of water or steam on metals.</li>\r\n<li>Hydrogen can be prepared by the action of dilute HCl or Dilute H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> on the metals.</li>\r\n<li>Hydrogen can be prepared by boiling powdered metals like zinc, aluminum, tin and lead with concentrated solution of caustic soda.</li>\r\n<li>Hydrogen can be prepared by passing electric current through acidulated water.</li>\r\n<li>Hydrogen is a colorless and odorless gas having no taste. It is the lightest element and is practically insoluble in water.</li>\r\n<li>Hydrogen is prepared in lab by the action of dilute sulphuric acid on granulated zinc. If copper sulphate is added to the above reactants, the reaction speeds up.</li>\r\n<li>Hydrogen is neutral towards litmus.</li>\r\n<li>Hydrogen reacts with oxygen to form water as the only product. It reacts with chlorine gas to form hydrogen chloride gas.</li>\r\n<li>Hydrogen is a good reducing agent and reduces metallic oxides to metals</li>\r\n<li>Hydrogen is used for (i) filling weather observation balloons, (Ii) the manufacture of chemicals, (iii) the hydrogenation of oils, (iv) the extraction of metals from their oxides, and (v) cutting and welding purposes.</li>\r\n<li>A mixture of hydrogen and oxygen burns with a characteristic pop sound. It is a test for hydrogen.</li>\r\n</ol>"
