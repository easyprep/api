  "question": "With reference to the temperature of the oceans, it has been noted that there is a very low decrease of temperature with increasing latitudes towards north in comparison to the southern Atlantic. What could be the possible reason for this?",
  "option1": "Gulf stream, a cold current brings down the temperature of southern Atlantic",
  "option2": "Gulf stream, a warm current brings up the temperature of northern Atlantic",
  "option3": "North Atlantic has more underwater volcanoes",
  "option4": "The mid Oceanic ridge is more prominent in north Atlantic",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Gulf stream, a warm current brings up the temperature of northern Atlantic",
