The northern part of the island is the French overseas collectivity of Saint-Martin and the southern part of the island is Sint Maarten, controlled by the Kingdom of Netherlands. This marks the only place in the world where France borders the Netherlands. Till 2007, Saint Martin was part of the Guadeloupe Islands, which was also an overseas region of France. In 2003, the people of Saint Martin voted a referendum in favor of secession from Guadeloupe."
