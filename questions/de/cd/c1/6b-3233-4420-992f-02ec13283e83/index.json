  "answer": "England",
  "explanation": "England has replaced India at the top of International Cricket Council one-day rankings. England, who last topped the ODI rankings in Jan 2013, has gained 8 points & moved to 125 points. India with 122 points is at the 2nd position followed by South Africa & New Zealand. England's rise up the table is because the forgettable 2014-15 season was dropped from the latest calculations.",
