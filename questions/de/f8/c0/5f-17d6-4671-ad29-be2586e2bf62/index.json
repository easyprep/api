  "question": "Bio-amplification of a pesticide would occur, if this pesticide fulfils the following condition / conditions: <ol><li>It is soluble in water</li><li>It is lipophilic</li><li>It does not easily degraded</li></ol> Select the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Itâ€™s the concentration of pollutant like chloromethyl mercury in the ecological food chain. Any substance more soluble in tissue than the surrounding media has the tendency to concentrate in the food chain of more complex biological species that live on simpler biological species. So, in a nutshell, bio-amplification occurs when concentrations of toxins are passed on from smaller prey to larger predators. <br> There are two main groups of substances that biomagnify. Both are lipophilic and not easily degraded. Novel organic substances are not easily degraded because organisms lack previous exposure and have thus not evolved specific detoxification and excretion mechanisms, as there has been no selection pressure from them. These substances are consequently known as 'persistent organic pollutants' or POPs. Metals are not degradable because they are elements. Organisms, particularly those subject to naturally high levels of exposure to metals, have mechanisms to sequester and excrete metals. Problems arise when organisms are exposed to higher concentrations than usual, which they cannot excrete rapidly enough to prevent damage. These metals are transferred in an organic form."
