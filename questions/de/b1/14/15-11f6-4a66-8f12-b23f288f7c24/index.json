  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "About 80 per cent of the coal deposits in India is of bituminous type and is of non-coking grade. This is one of the reasons that India has to rely upon imports of coking coal. In India 99% of our coal production comes from the Gondwana coals which are found in three geological units viz. Raniganj Formation, Barkar Formation and Karharbari Formation. Out of them the Karharbari Formation is the oldest formation in India. The Gondwana coals of Permian times are mainly found in the Peninsular Gondwana basins of India."
