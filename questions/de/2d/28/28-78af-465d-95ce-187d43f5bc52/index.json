  "question": "In light of the recent removal of certain persons from star campaigners list by the ECI, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Removal from the star campaigners’ list bans the persons from campaigning in any form.</li>\n<li>The campaign expenditure by star campaigners is exempt from being added to a candidate’s election expenditure.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe removal of a person from a star campaigners’ list does not affect the person’s ability to campaign in other forms. A recognised political party can have 40 such campaigners while an unrecognised one can have only 20 such campaigners. However, these unrecognised parties have to be registered for the same.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe expenditure from campaigning by a star candidate is not added to the election expenditure of a candidate. This exemption is applicable only if the star campaigner limits himself/ herself to general campaigning for the political party and not specifically for one candidate."
