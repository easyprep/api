  "question": "Which boxing punch style is a semi-circular punch thrown, with the lead hand to the side of the opponent's head?",
  "option1": "Hook",
  "option2": "Jab",
  "option3": "Cross",
  "option4": "Uppercut",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Hook",
  "explanation": "Hook is a semi-circular punch thrown with the lead hand to the side of the opponent's head. From the guard position, the elbow is drawn back with a horizontal fist (palm facing down) though in modern times a wide percentage of fighters throw the hook with a vertical fist (palm facing themselves). The rear hand is tucked firmly against the jaw to protect the chin. The torso and hips are rotated clockwise, propelling the fist through a tight, clockwise arc across the front of the body and connecting with the target."
