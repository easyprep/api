  "question": "The ministry for women and child development is about to felicitate performer states and districts in implementation of the ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ scheme. Consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>It is a direct benefit transfer scheme.</li>\n<li>It seeks to monitor the operation of the provisions under Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCP&amp;DT) Act, 1994.</li>\n<li>It seeks to improve the protection provided by the POCSO act.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?",
  "option1": "1 and 2",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "3 only",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe scheme is not a DBT. The scheme was launched in 2015 to address the declining sex ratio. Initially targeted at northern states, it is now a pan-Indian project. It has two components: advocacy and media campaign to spread awareness and multi-sectoral interventions for implementation in districts with poor statistics.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nOne of the aims of BBBP scheme is to improve the protection for the girl child by monitoring the implementation of various acts already in force for it. A major contributor to low child sex ratio/CSR is female foeticide. The scheme addresses the issue by monitoring the PCP&amp;DT act. This act deals with curbing the misuse of medical techniques for sex specific abortion.  \n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe scheme also aims to protect girl children from sexual abuse. It is one of its key objectives to provide safety using the POCSO act. The act is already being amended to have stricter provisions for penalising offenders and deter crimes against children in general."
