  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe LB-1 is a black hole that was discovered by the scientists in the Milky Way galaxy of which the Solar System is also a part. The LB-1 is about 15,000 light years away from the earth. The black hole is 70 times more massive than our sun.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe LB-1 black hole does not fall into any of the current categories of black holes (neither a stellar black hole nor a supermassive black hole). It is expected to be included in a new class. It is twice as massive as the predicted levels of current theories."
