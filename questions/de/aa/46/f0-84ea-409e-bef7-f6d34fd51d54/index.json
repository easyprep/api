  "question": "Which of the following is / are correct statements?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The carbon content in Cast iron is less than that in Pig Iron</li>\r\n<li>Wrought iron has lower carbon content than both the Cast Iron and Pig Iron</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "The immediate product of the Iron alloy found in mines is \\\"Pig iron\\\". Pig Iron has a very high Carbon Content (3.5-4.5%). So it is Brittle, Non-malleable and used only in limited applications.  Iron alloy which has impurity more than 2.1% but less than the Pig Iron is called \\\"Cast Iron\\\". They are mostly brittle but there are Malleable Cast Irons. The Cast Iron because of more impurities has a lower melting point. Historically cast Iron has been used in \\\"Bridge making\\\" all over the word. The famous \\\"Iron Bridge\\\" of England is made up of Cast Iron. \\\"Wrought iron\\\" has very low carbon content. It is also known as \\\"Slag\\'. When it is bent to the point of breaking, it gives texture which resembles wood. Wrought Iron was earlier known as \\\"Pure Iron”, but not now because; now the Iron, which has less than 0.008% impurity is considered to be commercially pure. The “Eiffel Tower “is made up of Wrought Iron."
