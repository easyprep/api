  "question": "Consider the following comparisons of the petrol engines and diesel engines: <br />1. Petrol engines have spark plugs , diesel engines have no spark plugs<br />2. In petrol engines the mixture of air and petrol is drawn in by the falling piston, in diesel engines only air is drawn in by the falling piston<br />3. In petrol engines the mixture of air and petrol is compressed, in diesel engines only air is compressed<br />Which among the above is / are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "<strong>Petrol Engine</strong><br />The engine ignition is induced by a spark. In these engines, air and fuel are generally mixed post-compression. Petrol engines work on the Otto cycle, which consists of two isochoric processes and two isentropic processes. In petrol engines, air and petrol are usually mixed in a carburettor before being introduced to the cylinder. Once the air and petrol are compressed, the fuel is ignited via an electric spark.<br /><strong>Diesel Engine</strong><br />The Diesel engine is also an internal combustion engine which is also known as the compression-ignition engine. It is named after Rudolf Diesel. In these engines, the fuel is injected into a combustion chamber and is then ignited by the high temperature of the air in the chamber. The high temperature of the air in the cylinder is due to the adiabatic compression. These engines only compress the air and not the fuel. When injected into the combustion chamber, the Diesel fuel undergoes spontaneous ignition. These engines work on the Diesel cycle, which consists of a constant pressure process, a constant volume process, and two isentropic processes."
