  "explanation": "Union Shipping Minister Nitin Gadkari has launched the revised guidelines for chartering of ships in India by providing Right of First Refusal (RoFR) to ships built in India. This has been done to incentivize ship building activity in the country and give a boost to the Make in India campaign.\r\n<h4>What Exactly is The RoFR?</h4>\r\nIt is a contractual right, but not an obligation, to enter into a business transaction with a person or company before anyone else can. However, if the entity with RoFR declines the transaction, the owner of the asset who offered the right can open the bidding up to other interested parties. Let us understand with an example – Suppose there is a tenant who prefers to stay in a rented house. He however would buy the house, if the owner would want to evict the tenant and sell the house. The tenant can enter into an RoFR agreement with the owner, so that when the owner is selling the house, he will first ask the tenant if he would buy it. If the tenant refuses to buy the house, then the owner can sell it to a third party.\r\n<h4>How Will This be Implemented in Shipping in India?</h4>\r\nWhenever a tendering process will be undertaken to charter a vessel, a bidder offering a ship that is built in India will be given the first priority to match the lowest bidder price (L1) quote. However, this can only happen if\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the L1 bidder is a foreigner or a company registered outside India, offering a ship not built in India, or</li>\r\n<li>the L1 bidder is a citizen of India OR company registered in India OR Society registered in India OR Indian Shipping company/organisation with a vessel registered/flagged in India (India-flag vessel), offering a ship not built in India</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>What is the Difference Between the India-flag Vessels and Vessels Built in India?</h5>\r\nIndia-flag vessels are those vessels which have been registered in India, but, these ships could have either been manufactured in India or outside India. Vessels built in India are those which are built and registered in India.\r\n<h5>What was the Previous Procedure for Chartering Ships in India?</h5>\r\nAccording to previous rules, RoFR was only available to Indian flag vessels under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958, which meant ships which were not built in India but were simply registered in India could also exercise this right.\r\nThis meant that the earlier rules didn’t provide any incentive to the local companies to build their ships in India. However, with the recent amendment to the rules, the local companies will be encouraged to manufacture the ships in India thus giving a boost to Make in India.\r\n<h6>What is the Regional Maritime Safety Conference?</h6>\r\nThis is the first time that a Regional Maritime Safety Conference 2019 is being organized in India. It has commenced from 19<sup>th</sup> February 2019 in Mumbai. It is a two-day conference that will deliberate on issues related to assuring maritime safety in the India-ASEAN sub-region, safeguarding our shores and promoting maritime trade. It has been organized by the National Maritime Foundation (NMF), in coordination with Ministry of Shipping and Ministry of External Affairs. The new rules have been launched by Mr. Gadkari in this Conference."
