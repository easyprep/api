  "question": "The term “Quasi-quadrennial oscillation” that was recently in news is associated to which of the following planets?",
  "option1": "Venus",
  "option2": "Mars",
  "option3": "Saturn",
  "option4": "Jupiter",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Jupiter",
  "explanation": "Recent exploration of the planet Jupiter shows that it has striking similarities to those on Earth. Jupiter's cycle is called the quasi-quadrennial oscillation, or QQO, and it lasts about four Earth years. The quasi-quadrennial oscillation (QQO) and its 4 year period in Jupiter's atmosphere were first discovered in 7.8m infrared observations spanning the 1980s and 1990s from detecting semiregular variations in equatorial brightness temperatures near 10 hPa."
