  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 & 3 Only",
  "explanation": "At any point of time, the money held with the public has two most liquid components. While M1/M0 is generally used to describe narrow money, M2/M3/M4 qualifies as broad money. Demand Deposit component is the money of the general public with the banks, which can be withdrawn by them using cheques, withdrawals and ATMs.<br> M1 = Currency with the public + Demand Deposits of public in Banks<br> When a third component viz. Post office Savings Deposits is also added to M1, it becomes M2.<br> M2 = M1 + Post Office Savings.<br> M3=M2 + Time Deposits"
