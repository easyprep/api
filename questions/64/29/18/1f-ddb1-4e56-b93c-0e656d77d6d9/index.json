  "question": "What is the ratio of the change in collector current to the change in base current at a constant collector-emitter voltage, when the common emitter transistor is in active state, known as?",
  "option1": "Input resistance",
  "option2": "Output resistance",
  "option3": "Current amplification factor",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Current amplification factor",
  "explanation": "Current amplification factor Î²: This is defined as the ratio of the change in collector current to the change in base current at a constant collector-emitter voltage (VCE) when the transistor is in active state."
