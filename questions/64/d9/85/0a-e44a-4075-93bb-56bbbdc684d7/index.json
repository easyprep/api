  "question": "The researchers of which country have developed renewable energy storage device?",
  "option1": "United Kingdom",
  "option2": "United States",
  "option3": "France",
  "option4": "Germany",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "United Kingdom",
  "explanation": "The researchers from Queen Mary institute of London have developed a new dielectric capacitor- a device that stores energy like a battery, taking inspiration from a French pastry. The croissant is made by folding multiple layers of dough. They found that by pressing and folding a polymer film capacitor, they were able to store 30 times more energy than the best-performing commercially available dielectric capacitor. This is the highest energy density ever reported in a polymer film capacitor. The advance may pave the way for efficient, low-cost, and environmentally-friendly electric energy storage systems for wind and solar sources. With this technique, large amounts of renewable energy can be stored."
