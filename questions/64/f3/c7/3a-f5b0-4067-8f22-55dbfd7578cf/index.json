  "question": "In context with the discovery of the 20 new moons, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Retrograde moons orbit their planet in the same direction as the planet’s rotation on its axis.</li>\n<li>All of the 20 new moons are retrograde.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nRetrograde moons are natural satellites that orbit their planet in a retrograde direction. This means that they move in a direction opposite to the direction of rotation of the planet on its axis. This is opposite of prograde moons which move in the same direction as the planet’s rotation.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe new moons were discovered around the Saturn. While 17 of these 20 moons orbit in a retrograde fashion, the remaining 3 are prograde moons. Of these 3 moons, 2 moons take 2 years to complete an orbit around the Saturn while one of them take about 3 years."
