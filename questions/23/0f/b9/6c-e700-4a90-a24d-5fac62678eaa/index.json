  "question": "Which of the following is the unit of rate of chemical reaction?",
  "option1": "Mol L s<sup>-1</sup>",
  "option2": "Mol L<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>",
  "option3": "Mol L<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>",
  "option4": "Mol L<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-2</sup>",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Mol L<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>",
  "explanation": "If concentration is in mol L<sup>-1</sup> and time is in seconds then the units will be Mol L<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. However, in gaseous reactions, when the concentration of gases is expressed in terms of their partial pressures, then the units of the rate equation will be atm s<sup>â€“1</sup>."
