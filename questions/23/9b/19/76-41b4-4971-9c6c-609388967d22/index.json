  "answer": "Ahmedabad",
  "explanation": "The first satyagraha in India was Champaran Satyagraha and the first Rajkumar Shukla requested Gandhiji to intervene into the matter of the indigo planters of Champaran. The planter were forced to grow indigo on 3/20th of the land . It was known as Tinkathia System. The agitation of Gandhiji eventually abolished the system and helped to recover 25% of the illegally taken money of the planters from the authority. In March 1918, under the leadership of Gandhi, there was a strike in the cotton mills in Ahmedabad. It was at this juncture that Gandhi began the ‘first’ of his seventeen ‘fasts unto death’ on 15 March, 1918."
