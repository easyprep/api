  "question": "At what rate per annum will 32000 Rs. yield a compound interest of 5044 Rs. in 9 months interest being compounded quarterly ?",
  "option1": 0.2,
  "option2": 0.32,
  "option3": 0.5,
  "option4": 0.8,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 0.2,
  "explanation": "Let the rate of CI be R per cent per annum.\r\n$latex \\\\therefore CI = P\\\\left [ \\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{R}{100} \\\\right )^{T} - 1 \\\\right ]&s=1$\r\n$latex => 5044 = 32000\\\\left [ \\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{R}{400} \\\\right )^{3} - 1 \\\\right ]&s=1$\r\n[âˆµ Interest is compounded quarterly]\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{5044}{32000} = \\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{R}{400} \\\\right )^{3} - 1&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{R}{400} \\\\right )^{3} - 1 = \\\\frac{1261}{8000}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{R}{400} \\\\right )^{3} = 1+\\\\frac{1261}{8000}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{R}{400} \\\\right )^{3} = \\\\frac{9261}{8000} = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{21}{20} \\\\right )^{3}&s=1$\r\n$latex => 1+\\\\frac{R}{400} = \\\\frac{21}{20} => \\\\frac{R}{400} = \\\\frac{21}{20}-1&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{R}{400} = \\\\frac{1}{20}&s=1$\r\n$latex => R = \\\\frac{400}{20} = 20\\\\%&s=1$\r\nHence option [A] is correct answer."
