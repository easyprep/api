In regard to the Princely States, the plan laid down that the policy of His Majesty's Government towards the Indian Princely States contained in the Cabinet Mission memorandum of 12 May 1946 would remained unchangedâ€”the British Paramountcy would lapse, and their status would revert to what it was before."
