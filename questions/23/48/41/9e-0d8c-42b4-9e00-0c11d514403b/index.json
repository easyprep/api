  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "<strong>Mistral</strong> refers to the northerly or north-westerly (i.e. coming from north) cold wind experienced on the shores of the north-west Mediterranean, mainly around the Rhone-delta. It is more intense during the winter, when pressure is relatively high over the European continent and low over the western Mediterranean; it reaches great force in the rear of a deep depression situated over the gulf of lions that is moving away eastwards or south-eastwards. <br /><strong>Sirocco</strong> is a Mediterranean wind that comes from the Sahara and reaches hurricane speeds in North Africa and Southern Europe. <br /><strong>Nor’easter</strong> refers to strong storm with winds from the northeast on the north eastern coast of the United States (particularly New England states) and the east coast of Canada (Atlantic Canada))"
