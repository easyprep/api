  "question": "<div>The importance of ‘obligate symbiosis’ between Sea Anemones and Clownfish was recently highlighted by studies. In this context, consider the following statements:</div>\n<ol>\n<li>Obligate symbiosis means that the symbionts are entirely dependent on each other for survival.</li>\n<li>Facultative symbionts cannot survive without each other.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "Statement<strong> 1 is correct:</strong>\nObligate symbiosis is the process by which two organisms form a symbiotic relationship where one or both the symbionts cannot survive without the other. Recent studies show that with the reduction in the number of anemones, the Clownfish population is expected to take a hit.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nFacultative symbiosis is a type of symbiotic relationship where the symbionts gain advantages from the other when and if possible. They do not necessarily need the other for their very survival. The algae in certain lichens behave this way."
