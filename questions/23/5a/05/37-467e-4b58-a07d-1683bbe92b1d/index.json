  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of them",
  "explanation": "Section 497- Adultery Section 306- Abetment of suicide Section 499- Defamation <em>Section 499</em> of IPC is associated with Defamation. Whoever, by words either spoken or intended to be read, or by signs or by visible representations, makes or publishes any imputation concerning any person intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm, the reputation of such person, is said, except in the cases hereinafter expected, to defame that person.  <em>Section 497</em> of the IPC is associated with Adultery Law. As per the Indian law, a woman cannot be punished for the offence of adultery. Only a man who has consensual sexual intercourse with the wife of another man without his consent can be punished under this offense in India. <em>Section 306 </em>is associated to Abetment of suicide. As per this section, if any person commits suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine. <em>Section 375</em> is associated to Rape. Recently, Supreme Court held that sexual intercourse with minor (below 18 years) wife is rape. Section 375 defines rape as sexual intercourse or any of the specified sexual acts with or without the consent between a man and a girl less than 18 years of age."
