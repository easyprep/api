  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The principal resource of the Indus realms was its agricultural wealth, since land suitable for growing crops and raising livestock was plentiful and well distributed. Other foodstuffs, such as fish and other aquatic resources, wildfowl, game, and wild plants, were also abundant and important. Apart from food, the people of the Indus civilization also required tools, shelter, clothing, and a number of commodities that had social, and probably political or religious, significance. Items of jewellery, particularly bangles and strings of beads, were very important in Indus dress. Many bangles were manufactured from seashells fished or gathered by coastal communities in Gujarat and the Makran. A flourishing exchange network had brought seashells to inland sites in earlier times, but the volume of such shells circulating in the Indus period was vastly greater. Beads were made from a great variety of materials, the majority from gemstones such as agate, carnelian (chalcedony), jasper, and onyx, which could be obtained from the rivers of Kutch and Saurashtra and from southern Gujarat, in particular the Rajpipla mines on the Narmada River."
