  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "Only  3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "This question tries you to differentiate between the Prapatya Vivaha and Arsha Vivaha and Asura Vivah. In Prajapatya Vivaha, the rights of boy and girl were equally secured, this is a correct statement. How to secure? The groom approached the father of the bride and the father of the bride would agree on certain conditions BUT not certain price. Please note that in Arsha Vivaha, the bride\\'s father used to receive a pair of cattle for certain uses prescribed by the law. But still it was NOT a price of the bride. It was only the Asura Vivah in which the groom`s family paid to the bride\\'s family in return for the girl."
