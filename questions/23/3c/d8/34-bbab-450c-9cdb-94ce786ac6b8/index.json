  "explanation": "\"Faster, Higher, Stronger\" is the motto of the Olympic Games. The Olympic motto is the \"Citius, Altius, Fortius\" whoseÂ  Latin meaning is \"faster, higher, stronger\". It was proposed by Pierre de Coubertin upon the creation of the International Olympic Committee in 1894. Coubertin borrowed it from his friend Henri Didon, a Dominican priest who was an athletics enthusiast. Coubertin said, \"These three words represent a programme of moral beauty. The aesthetics of sport are intangible\". The motto was introduced in 1924 at the Olympic Games in Paris."
