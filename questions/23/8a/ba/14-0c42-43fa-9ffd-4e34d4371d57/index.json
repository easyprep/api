  "question": "For what conditions Proportional representation is NOT necessary in a country?",
  "option1": "there are no reserved constituencies",
  "option2": "a two-party system has developed",
  "option3": "the first-past-post system prevails",
  "option4": "there is a fusion of Presidential and Parliamentary forms of governments",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "a two-party system has developed",
  "explanation": "The main purpose of the proportional representation system is to assure the representation of all groups and ideologies. So, it is usually adopted in a multi-party system representing multiple ideologies.<br /> In a two party system, the seats are ultimately going to be divided between the two parties and there is negligible chance of leaving out a group as compared to the multi-party system.<br />So, first past the post can be adopted in two party system, avoiding the complexities of proportional representation."
