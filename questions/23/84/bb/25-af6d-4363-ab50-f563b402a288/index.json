  "question": "Consider the following statements with respect to Ebola virus disease: <ol> <li>Spider monkeys are considered as the natural Ebola virus hosts.</li> <li>No licensed vaccines are available yet for the disease.</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 Only",
  "explanation": "First statement is wrong because Fruit bats are considered as the natural ebola virus host. Ebola virus disease (formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever) is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90%. Ebola is much less contagious than many other more common diseases. People cannot get Ebola virus disease through food, water or the air contact. But the disease can be easily spread through contact with the bodily fluids of infected humans.The Ebola outbreak in West African nations such as Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since 2013 proved fatal for many."
