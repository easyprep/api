  "question": "With reference to the recent decision to abolish the anti-dumping duty on purified terephthalic acid (PTA), consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is used in the manufacturing of plastics.</li>\n<li>The move will decrease the price of manufacturing polyester based fabrics.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe purified terephthalic acid is an organic compound used in the manufacturing of plastics. Its major use is as a raw material in the manufacturing of PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastics. The government announced the decision to remove the anti-dumping duty on the PTA import ‘in public interest’.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe PTA is used as a major raw material in manufacturing polyesters. Nearly 80% of the polyester products are manufactured from PTA. The removal of the anti-dumping duty will encourage the manufacturers to source PTA from cheaper imports thus reducing the cost of manufacturing."
