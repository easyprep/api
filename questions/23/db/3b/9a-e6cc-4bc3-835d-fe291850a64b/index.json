The 2018 GEAR is an Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) global Index and benchmarking study commissioned by Visa. This is the third edition of the study after those in 2007 and 2011. It ranks governments by quantifying their e-payment capabilities based on various indicators. The survey has lauded India for taking \\\"rapid strides\\\" in advancing government e-payments capabilities and called it one of the top- performing countries in terms of Citizen-to-Government (C2G), Government-to-Citizen (G2C), Business-to-Government (B2G), Government-to-Business (G2B) transactions. Norway leads the pack in the 73-country ranking, followed by France and Denmark. The 73-country survey looks at availability of government electronic transaction services and the underlying environment of mechanisms that support digitisation for all transactions in a market, such as policy and infrastructure."
