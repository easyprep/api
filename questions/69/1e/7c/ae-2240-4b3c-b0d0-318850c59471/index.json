  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Marayur jaggery was awarded the GI tag in March of 2019. This is tagged to the Idukki district in Kerala. The tagging has increased the returns in the sector which was facing vulnerability from duplicate products, especially from TN.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nIt is produced on the local sugarcane farms by Idukki farmers. This is mostly a cottage industry and no chemicals are added. The product is characterised by high iron content, high sweetness and low sodium content. It also has a dark brown colour."
