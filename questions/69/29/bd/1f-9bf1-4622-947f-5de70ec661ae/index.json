The purpose of the HCL’s early career programme is to provide students an opportunity to start early & become financially independent and trendsetters.  Under the initiative, the company will conduct an entrance test for those completed Plus 2 or Intermediate course and gives them a year’s training to make them employable. Students who have completed Intermediate in 2018 or 2019 with more than 60% marks are eligible for the programme. However, the students will have to a pay fee of Rs. 2 lakhs to join the programme. The firm would facilitate a bank loan, which can be repaid in EMIs after they are absorbed into the company. While working at HCL, students can enrol in higher education programmes offered by reputed universities such as BITS Pilani and SASTRA University. The students after completion of required training will be recruited with salary range of Rs two lakh to Rs 2.5 lakh depending on what work stream they are taken into."
