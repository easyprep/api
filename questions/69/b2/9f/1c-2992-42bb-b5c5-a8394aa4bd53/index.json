  "option4": "Plancks constant",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Specific Gravity",
  "explanation": "Specific Gravity does not have any unit of measurement Specific Gravity = Density of body/ Density of water at 4Â°C It is the ratio between the density of an object and a reference substance. Based on the value of specific gravity , we can tell whether the object will sink or float in our reference substance."
