  "question": "Which of the following is / are correct statements about the Inter-State Council? <ol> <li>It is permanent constitutional body established as per recommendations of Singhvi committee</li> <li>It is only constitutional mechanism for coordination between the States of the Union</li> </ol> Select the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "Inter State council was set up on the basis of recommendation of Sarkaria committee. As the article 263 makes it clear, the Inter-State Council is not a permanent constitutional body for coordination between the States of the Union. The council is chaired by the Prime Minister of India. Thus first statement is not correct. Second statement is also not correct and is narrow in its vision."
