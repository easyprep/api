About 100 canteens were opened in 35 Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) in the first phase. They would serve breakfast, lunch and dinner for just Rs 5 a plate on week days. The canteens across the State offer a uniform menu that includes idli on all days or puri, upma and pongal on select days for breakfast and rice with a curry, pickle, dal or sambar and curd for lunch and dinner. In it, anyone can make a donation in the name of their near and dear ones on special occasions and the names of the persons would be displayed at the respective canteen. Each canteen is expected to serve at least 350 plates of food for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The capacity could be extended up to 500 plates when needed. The project is taken up by the Akshaya Patra Foundation, which provides the meals, in collaboration with the Municipal Administration and Civil Supplies Departments."
