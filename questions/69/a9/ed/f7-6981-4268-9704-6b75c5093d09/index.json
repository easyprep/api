  "explanation": "Ardennes Forest is a region of extensive forests, rough terrain, rolling hills, and ridges located primarily in Belgium and Luxembourg, but stretching as well into Germany and France. It was an important battle site in World War II, used by the German Army in the Battle of France and Battle of the Bulge to invade northern France and southern Belgium. The trees and rivers of the Ardennes provided the charcoal industry assets that enabled the great industrial period of Wallonia in the 18th and 19th centuries, when it was arguably the second great industrial region of the world, after England. The greater region maintained an industrial eminence into the 20th century after coal replaced charcoal in metallurgy."
