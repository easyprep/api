The thermal battery plant, which is manufactured by the Bharat Energy Storage Technology Private Limited (BEST),  is expected to start commercial operations by May 2019. The technology will help in mitigating carbon emissions and is best suited for grid balancing and stabilisations. It will also be used to store energy for telecommunication, commercial establishments, electric vehicles and highway charging stations. It can also be effectively used in remote locations, such as hilly terrains and islands. The BEST also aims to set up a Greenfield Project in India, at an estimated cost of Rs 660 crores, through which nearly 3000 jobs are expected to be created within three years\\' time. It must be noted that the thermal battery technology was patented in India by Dr Patrick Glynn in 2016."
