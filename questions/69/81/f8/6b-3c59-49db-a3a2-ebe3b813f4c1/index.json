  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Â Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe draft regulation was released by FSSAI. It gives a 10 point charter for regulations. The draft calls for engagement of a nutritionist or dietician by the school to oversee the preparation of the menu for the school children. This is not mandatory. The engagement can be periodical.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe FSSAI draft regulation has banned the sale of high fat food in school premises. Food that are high in sugar and salt are also banned by the draft regulations. Such food items cannot be sold within 50m of school campus."
