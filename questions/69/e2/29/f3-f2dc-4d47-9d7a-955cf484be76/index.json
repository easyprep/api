  "question": "What is the India's rank in the global Corruption Perception Index (CPI) for 2017, which is recently released by the Transparency International (TI)?",
  "option1": "76th",
  "option2": "93rd",
  "option3": "55th",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "81st",
  "explanation": "India has been ranked 81st out of 180 countries in the global Corruption Perception Index (CPI) for 2017, released by Transparency International (TI), which named the country among the \\\"worst offenders\\\" in terms of graft and press freedom in the Asia Pacific region. In 2016 India was in the 79th place among 176 countries. The index, which measures perception of corruption in the public sector, uses a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 is highly corrupt and 100 is very clean. Indiaâ€™s score remained intact at 40 points in both 2016 and 2017. This year, New Zealand and Denmark scored the highest scores with 89 and 88 out of 100, respectively. Somalia was found to be the most corrupt country in the world. The 2017 index highlights that the majority of countries are making little or no progress in ending corruption, while further analysis shows journalists and activists in corrupt countries risking their lives every day in an effort to speak out."
