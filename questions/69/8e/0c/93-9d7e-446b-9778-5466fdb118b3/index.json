  "explanation": "The&nbsp;International Astronomical Union (IAU) currently recognizes five dwarf planets:&nbsp;Ceres,&nbsp;Pluto,&nbsp;Haumea,&nbsp;Makemake, and&nbsp;Eris. A dwarf planet is a planetary-mass object that is neither a planet nor a natural satellite.&nbsp;It is in direct orbit of the Sun, and is massive enough for its gravity to crush it."
