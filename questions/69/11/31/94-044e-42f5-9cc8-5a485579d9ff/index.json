  "question": "The second law of motion gives us a measure of which of the following physical quantities?",
  "option1": "Acceleration",
  "option2": "Force",
  "option3": "Power",
  "option4": "Work done",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Force",
  "explanation": "The second law of motion gives us a measure of force. The product of the mass of the body and the acceleration produced in it gives us the magnitude of force. Force (f) = mass (m) x acceleration (a) Force is a vector quantity and the direction is same as that of acceleration"
