  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 Only",
  "explanation": "V Shaped valley is formed due to fluvial action. U Shaped valley or&nbsp;glacial troughs are formed by the process of&nbsp;glaciations. Similarly, a hanging valley is higher than the main valley; it is formed when a glacier of larger volume overdeepens&nbsp;the U shaped valley."
