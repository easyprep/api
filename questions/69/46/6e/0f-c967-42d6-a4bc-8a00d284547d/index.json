  "answer": "oil is rich in unsaturated fatty acids",
  "explanation": "Canola refers to special type of oil seed mustard varieties bred for human consumption. The main characteristic of these varieties is that the oil is rich in unsaturated fatty acids.<br />Rapeseed, also known as rape, oilseed rape, and, in the case of one particular group of cultivars, canola, is a bright-yellow flowering member of the family Brassicaceae, cultivated mainly for its oil-rich seed. It is the third-largest source of vegetable oil and second-largest source of protein meal in the world. Canola is often touted as one of the healthiest oils due to its low level of saturated fat.<br />Here is the fatty acid breakdown of canola oil (7Trusted Source):<br />Saturated fat: 7%<br />Monounsaturated fat: 64%<br />Polyunsaturated fat: 28%<br />The polyunsaturated fats in canola oil include 21% linoleic acid — more commonly known as omega-6 fatty acid — and 11% alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a type of omega-3 fatty acid derived from plant sources."
