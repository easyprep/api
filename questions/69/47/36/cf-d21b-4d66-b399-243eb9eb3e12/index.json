  "option1": "Qatar",
  "option2": "South Africa",
  "option3": "Oman",
  "option4": "Saudi Arabia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Oman",
  "explanation": "Over 200 scientists from 25 nations are conducting simulation tests in the vast sandy terrain of Dhofar Desert in southern Oman for a manned mission to Mars. Scientists from across the world sent ideas for experiments and the mission, named AMADEE-18, quickly grew to 16 scientific experiments, such as testing a \"tumbleweed\" whip-fast robot rover and a new space suit called Aouda. The cutting-edge spacesuit, weighing about 50 kilograms, is called a \"personal spaceship\" because one can breathe, eat and do hard science inside it. The suit's visor displays maps, communications and sensor data. A blue piece of foam in front of the chin can be used to wipe your nose and mouth.",
