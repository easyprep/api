  "question": "In light of the recent debate about the ongoing practice of ‘shark finning’ in Colombia, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Shark finning causes the sharks to die of suffocation.</li>\n<li>Shark finning is banned in India.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nShark finning is the process by which fishermen cut out the fins of shark and discard the rest of the fish into the water- often still alive. This is because the fins are the most valuable part and transporting the rest of the bulky body is not very valuable. The finned sharks often die of suffocation because without their fins they cannot move to filter the water through their gills.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe practice of shark finning is banned in India. However, the practice still goes on in the country and also other countries where its legally banned- such as Colombia. Many endangered shark species, including those listed under CITES, are affected by the practice."
