  "question": "With respect to the recent RBI report highlighting the concept of ‘greenwashing’, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It is the process of investing in environmentally friendly projects.</li>\r\n<li>It is also known as green finance.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nGreenwashing is a play on the term ‘whitewashing’. Using greenwashing, companies capitalise by selling products by falsely claiming that it’s environmentally friendly. This leads to deception of the customers by the companies targeting the demand for environmentally conscious products and services.\r\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nGreenwashing is also known as ‘green sheen’. It is used not only in the green finance sector but also by manufacturing sector and conventional energy based firms. Superficial changes like change of product names, rebranding and repackaging without actual environmental compliances are used by such firms."
