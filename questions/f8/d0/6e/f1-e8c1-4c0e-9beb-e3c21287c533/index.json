  "question": "If a boat goes 100 km downstream in 10 hours and 75 km upstream in 15 hours, then the speed of the stream is :",
  "option1": "3.5 km/hr",
  "option2": "2 km/hr",
  "option3": "3 km/hr",
  "option4": "2.5 km/hr",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2.5 km/hr",
  "explanation": "Rate downstream = 10 kmph\r\nRate upstream = 5 kmph\r\nâˆ´ Speed of current = $latex \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left ( 10-5 \\\\right )kmph&s=1$\r\n$latex =>2.5km/hr$\r\nHence option [D] is the right answer."
