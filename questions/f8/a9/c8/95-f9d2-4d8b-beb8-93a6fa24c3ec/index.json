  "question": "Which country has permitted doctors to create three-parent babies through mitochondrial donation, in a move to prevent passing of incurable genetic diseases from mothers to babies?",
  "option1": "Russia",
  "option2": "Sweden",
  "option3": "Australia",
  "option4": "UK",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "UK",
  "explanation": "UK has permitted doctors to create three-parent babies through mitochondrial donation, in a move to prevent passing of incurable genetic diseases from mothers to babies. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has permitted to apply the procedures to two women in Newcastle, England. This will utilize mitochondrial donation therapy for those women, who are sure that their children would inherit a neurodegenerative disorder. Mitochondrial DNA will be obtained from a donor \"mother\". So that, the genetic conditions will not be passed on to the baby from the original mother. This will be the first three-parent baby in the UK.",
