  "answer": "Punjab",
  "explanation": "Punjab State Government has issued notification to attach Super Straw Management System while using the combine harvester machines for harvesting the paddy (rice) crop. Super straw management system, attached to self propelled combine harvesters, cuts the paddy straw into small pieces and spreads the same. By following this method of harvesting, farmers are not required to burn the paddy straw, before sowing the next crop. Burning the paddy straw, before sowing the next crop (referred to as stubble burning), has been identified as a major cause of air pollution in North India during winter months. In context of this news, it is important to note that local harvesters are not keen on using super straw management system as it is priced at around Rs 1.20 lakh and attaching it to the combine harvester increases fuel consumption.",
