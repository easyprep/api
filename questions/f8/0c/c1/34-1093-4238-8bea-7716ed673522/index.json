  "option1": "Qasida",
  "option2": "Marsiya",
  "option3": "Shahr Ashob",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Shahr Ashob",
  "explanation": "Masud Sa'd Salman, Mir Taqi Mir, Mirza Muhammad Rafi, Sauda, Qaim Chandpuri etc. were important poets. The genre of Urdu poetry known as shahr ashob (literally the city‟s misfortune) gives us a personalized account of individual reactions to the period of Mughal decline in the 18th century. Two major poets specializing in this genre were MirTaqi Mir (1724-1810) and Mirza Rafi Sauda (1713-81) both of whom were old enough to feel the trauma of Nadir Shah‟s attack on Delhi, the imperial city. The pain and privations of the city and its residents who faced shortages, hardships and exactions formed the subject matter of a lot of the poetry."
