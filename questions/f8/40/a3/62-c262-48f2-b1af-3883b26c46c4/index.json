  "explanation": "Lempa River is a river in Central America which flows through El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. This river rises from the Sierra Madre mountain range at Guatemala and then flows through Honduras to reach El Salvador which finally drains into the Pacific Ocean. This river forms a small part of the international boundary between El Salvador and Honduras. This river houses Cerron Grande Hydroelectric Dam. Forty-nine per cent of El Salvador's territory is covered by the Lempa river basin, and 77.5 per cent of the Salvadoran population lives in cities, towns, and villages that are in its basin, including the capital city of San Salvador."
