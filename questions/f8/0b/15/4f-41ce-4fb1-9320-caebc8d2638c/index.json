  "question": "What is the dimensional formula of work done?",
  "option1": "M<sup>1</sup> L<sup>1</sup> T<sup>-1</sup>",
  "option2": "M<sup>1</sup> L<sup>2</sup> T<sup>-1</sup>",
  "option3": "M<sup>1</sup> L<sup>-1</sup> T<sup>-2</sup>",
  "option4": "M<sup>1</sup> L<sup>2</sup> T<sup>-2</sup>",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "M<sup>1</sup> L<sup>2</sup> T<sup>-2</sup>",
  "explanation": "The dimensional formula of work done is M<sup>1</sup> L<sup>2</sup> T<sup>-2</sup>. Work is said to be done by a force when the body is displaced actually through some distance in the direction of applied force. The S.I unit of Work is joule."
