In the coastal regions, during night, the air over the sea is warmer than the air over land.<br />Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",

  "option2": "2 only",
  "option3": "1 & 2",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Land heats and cools more frequently than the sea. During the day time, the land gets heated and the air over the land being hotter and lighter than that over the sea, a low-pressure area is created over the land. The hot air rises and cool air from the sea reach in towards the land, which is referred to as the sea breeze. During the time of night, the land rapidly loses its heat faster than the sea. The air over the sea is, therefore, warmer and lighter than over the land and a breeze blows but from the land towards the sea.</span>"
