  "answer": "Algernon Sidney",
  "explanation": "The phrase \"God helps those who help themselves\" is a popular motto which emphasizes the importance of self-initiative. \nThe phrase originated in ancient Greece, occurring as the moral to one of Aesop's Fables, and later in the great tragedy authors of ancient Greek drama. It has been commonly attributed to Benjamin Franklin, however the modern English wording appears earlier in Algernon Sidney's work. \nIt is mistaken by many to be a Bible quote, however the phrase does not occur in the Bible. Some Christians have criticized it as actually against the Bible's basic message of God's grace.",
