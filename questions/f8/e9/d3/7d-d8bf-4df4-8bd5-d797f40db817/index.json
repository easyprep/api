  "question": "Which of the following produces Electromagnetic waves?",
  "option1": "charges at rest",
  "option2": "charges in uniform motion",
  "option3": "accelerated charges",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "accelerated charges",
  "explanation": "Neither stationary charges nor charges in uniform motion (steady currents) can be sources of electromagnetic waves. The former produces only electrostatic fields, while the latter produces magnetic fields that, however, do not vary with time. As per Maxwellâ€™s theory, accelerated charges radiate electromagnetic waves."
