  "question": "In which of the following pairs is the repulsion greatest as per the VSEPR Theory?",
  "option1": "lone pair - lone pair",
  "option2": "lone pair - bond pair",
  "option3": "bond pair - bond pair",
  "option4": "Same for all",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "lone pair - lone pair",
  "explanation": "The repulsion of a lone pair of electrons for another lone pair is greater than that between a bond pair and a lone pair which in turn is greater than that between two bond pairs. The correct order of repulsive force is as: lone pair - lone pair > lone pair - bond pair > bond pair - bond pair."
