  "question": "Which of the following is correct?",
  "option1": "A colloidal solution is a heterogeneous mixture",
  "option2": "A colloidal solution is a homogeneous mixture",
  "option3": "The particles of a colloidal solution cannot scatter beam of light",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "A colloidal solution is a heterogeneous mixture",
  "explanation": "Due to the relatively smaller size of particles, as compared to that of a suspension, the mixture appears to be homogeneous. But actually, a colloidal solution is a heterogeneous mixture. The particles can easily scatter a beam of visible light."
