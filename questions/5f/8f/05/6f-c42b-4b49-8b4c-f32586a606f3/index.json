  "question": "In context with the recent studies on EV-D68 virus, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is an enterovirus.</li>\n<li>It exclusively causes nervous disorders.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe EV-D68 virus belongs to a class of viruses known as the Enteroviruses. These are single-stranded RNA based viruses. They cause diseases among mammals, including humans. They are called so because they are transmitted through the intestine. ‘Entero’ means in relation to intestine.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:    </strong>\nThe EV-D68 exclusively causes respiratory diseases. The virus is being considered as a potential candidate as the pathogen causing Acute Flaccid Myelitis. The symptoms of infection range from flu-like to polio-like conditions. It may even lead to respiratory failure."
