The J&amp;K flag has 3 stripes representing the regions of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. It dependence on farming is indicated by a plough. With the passage of the bill, the flag will be removed. Only the Indian tricolor will be hoisted in the UTs.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe J&amp;K cadre of civil servants will be scrapped. The system used for other 7 UTs will now apply to the new UTs. The cadre will now be absorbed into the AGMUT cadre.

They are the representatives of the President in the UTs. In J&amp;K UT, the legislative assembly with the CM will inform the LG abut its legislations. The UTs are to be governed like the other UTs of the country."
