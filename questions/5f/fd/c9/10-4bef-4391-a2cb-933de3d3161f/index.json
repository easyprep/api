  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The classical Indian dance have two types of temperaments—<strong>tandava</strong>, representing the fearful male energy of Shiva, and <strong>lasya</strong>, representing the lyrical grace of Shiva’s wife Parvati. The dances which are predominantly of Tandava temperament are performed by male artists and those which have lasya mood are performed by female. For example, Bharatanatyam has the lasya character and that is why it is performed by women only, though there are male gurus and teachers also. Kathakali on the other hand is in tandava mood with towering headgear and elaborate facial makeup. It is generally performed by males. Further, Kathak is a mixture of lasya and tandava characterized by intricate footwork and mathematical precision of rhythmic patterns. It is done equally by men and women. Manipuri, with its swaying and gliding movements, is lasya, and its performers are mainly female."
