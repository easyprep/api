He broke the record of compatriot and batting great Sachin Tendulkar, who had reached the milestone in 259 innings. Kohli, who took only 205 innings to achieve the record, has become the fifth Indian to reach the 10,000 mark in ODIs. Apart from Kohli, Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and MS Dhoni have scored over 10,000 runs in ODIs. It must be noted that Kohliâ€™s  last 1,000 runs came from just 11 innings, which is also a world record. His strike rate at 92.5 is the highest among batsmen with 10,000 runs in one-day format."
