  "explanation": "• Sima is the earth\\'s crusts lower layer and contains rocks with an abundance of magnesium silicate minerals, the word Sima is an amalgam of the first two letters of Magnesium and Silica.<br />• In geology, the term \\'sial\\' refers to the composition of the upper layer of the Earth\\'s crust, namely rocks rich in silicates and aluminum minerals. As these elements are less dense than the majority of the earth\\'s elements, they tend to be concentrated in the upper layer of the crust.<br />• The crust and the upper layer of the mantle together make up a zone of rigid, brittle rock called the Lithosphere. The layer below the rigid lithosphere is a zone of asphalt-like consistency called the Asthenosphere. The asthenosphere is the part of the mantle that flows and moves the plates of the Earth.<br />• A peninsula is a landform surrounded by water on the majority of its border while being connected to a mainland from which it extends. Peninsulas are not always named as such; one can also be a headland, cape, island promontory, bill, point, fork, or spit."
