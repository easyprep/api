  "question": "Which of the following represents the angular momentum of an electron as per Bohr's model (h= Planck's constant)?",
  "option1": "h/π",
  "option2": "nh/2π",
  "option3": "2πnh",
  "option4": "πnh",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "nh/2π",
  "explanation": "Bohr's postulate states that the electron revolves around the nucleus only in those orbits for which the angular momentum is some integral multiple of h/2π where h is the Planck’s constant (= 6.6 × 10<sup>–34</sup> J s). Thus the angular momentum (L) of the orbiting electron is quantised. That is L = nh/2π"
