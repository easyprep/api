  "question": "Rwanda’s efforts against cervical cancer has been highlighted in news recently. In this context, consider the following statements about this cancer:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is caused by bacterial infection. </li>\n<li>Vaccination can prevent cervical cancers.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nCervical cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality among women across the world. Most of the cases (90%) is caused by viral infection. The Human Papilloma Virus/ HPV is the causative agent. The cancer develops in the cervix and can spread to other parts of the body.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nVaccination can help prevent cervical cancer. The use of HPV vaccine as a part of routine vaccination is recommended in all countries by WHO. Though the cancer is still prevalent in India (25% of cervical cancer related deaths across the world is in India), the vaccine is yet to be widely implemented."
