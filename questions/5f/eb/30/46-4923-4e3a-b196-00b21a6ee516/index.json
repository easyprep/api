  "option1": "Madras High Court",
  "option2": "Delhi High Court",
  "option3": "Bombay High Court",
  "option4": "Kerala High Court",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Madras High Court",
  "explanation": "The Madras High Court has ruled that the national song ‘Vande Mataram’ be made compulsory in all educational institutions and government or private organisations in Tamil Nadu. As per ruling, the national song be played and sung in all schools, colleges and universities at least once a week, preferably on Monday or Friday and in government offices, private companies, factories and industries at least once a month. The issue pertains to a case filed by K Veeramani who lost the state recruitment board exam by a mark as he answered Bengali for the question on the language of \\'Vande Mataram\\' while the answer key said that it was written in Sanskrit. Opposing his submission, Veeramani approached the Madras High Court and sought clarity on whether \\'Vande Mataram\\' was written in Sanskrit or Bengali. As per ruling, it is the duty of every citizen to abide by the ideals ingrained in the Constitution and as such show respect to the National Anthem and the National Flag."
