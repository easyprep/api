  "question": "Which among the following forms of precipitation is/are correctly matched?<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Sleet - Precipitation in the form of solid rounded particle with concentric layers of ice on one another</li>\r\n<li>Drizzle - Precipitation when the drop size is less than 0.5 mm</li>\r\n<li>Hail - Precipitation in the form of frozen raindrops or refroze melted snow water</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 2",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "Sleet is a precipitation in the form of frozen raindrops or refroze melted snow water. It occurs when a layer of temperature above freezing point overlies a subfreezing layer near the ground.<br /><br />Drops of rains after being released by the clouds become solidified into small rounded stone pieces of ice, this is known as hailstones. They are formed by rainwater passing through colder layers and hence have several concentric layers of ice, one over the another."
