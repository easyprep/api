  "answer": "UNSC",
  "explanation": "The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has unanimously passed the first-ever resolution ordering members to enforce laws against terror financing. The resolution demands all states to ensure that their domestic laws and regulations establish serious criminal offenses to collect funds or financial resources to terrorist groups or individual criminals. It also calls on members to create financial intelligence units. Nations that fail to carry out the resolution would face U.N. sanctions. U.N. counter-terrorism chief Vladimir Voronkov said the resolution comes at a \\\"critical time,\\\" adding terrorists have gotten their hands on cash through both illegal and legal channels."
