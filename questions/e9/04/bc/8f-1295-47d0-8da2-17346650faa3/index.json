  "question": "The constitution of India is considered federal in nature, and unitary in spirit. Which of the following is not a federal feature?",
  "option1": "Three-tier governmental structure",
  "option2": "Independent Judiciary",
  "option3": "Bicameralism",
  "option4": "Appointment of state governors by the central government",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Appointment of state governors by the central government",
  "explanation": "The constitution is considered federal in nature, and unitary in spirit. It has features of a federation (a codified, supreme constitution, a three-tier governmental structure [central, state and local], division of powers, bicameralism and an independent judiciary) and unitary features such as a single constitution, single citizenship, an integrated judiciary, a flexible constitution, a strong central government, appointment of state governors by the central government, All India Services (the IAS, IFS and IPS) and emergency provisions. This unique combination makes it quasi-federal in form."
