  "explanation": "The Massif Central is a highland region located in the middle of southern France, consisting of mountains and plateaus. It covers about 15% of mainland France. These central mountains are separated from the Alps by a deep north-south cleft created by the Rhone River, which is known as \"Rhone furrow\". This region was a barrier to transport within France until the opening of the A75 motorway."
