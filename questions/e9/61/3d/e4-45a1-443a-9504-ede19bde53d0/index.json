  "question": "Why some vegetables and fruits such as Brinjal and Apples become dark when kept open after cutting?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The Starch is hydrolysed into sugar</li>\r\n<li>The rate of respiration increases</li>\r\n<li>Rate of Production of Ethylene increases</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "This question is based upon the climacteric, which is a stage of fruit ripening. The climacteric is a stage of fruit ripening associated with ethylene production and cell respiration rise. Apples, bananas, melons, apricots, tomatoes (among others) are climacteric fruit. Citrus, grapes, strawberries are non-climacteric (they ripen without ethylene and respiration bursts). The fruits continue to respire even after harvesting and these results in the breakdown of the tissues. When a fruit is cut more oxygen is available for respiration so statement 2 is correct. The rate of increased respiration comes along with concomitant increase in release in Ethylene. The rate in increased ethylene comes with the following results:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Hydrolysis of starch in sugar</li>\r\n<li>Softening of cell walls</li>\r\n<li>Changes in Pigmentation</li>\r\n<li>Breakdown of tissues</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThus all the statements in the above question are correct."
