  "option5": "",
  "answer": 11,
  "explanation": "India is in 11th rank on FDI Confidence Index 2018 marks a drop of three places as compared to 8th rank in 2017. The report outlined that Indian Government's demonetisation move in November 2016 and roll out of Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2017 may have deterred foreign investors for short term. However, investors based in the Americas and those engaged in industry sector consider India as their preferred destination on account of Indian Government's inclination to have closer ties with US and its Make in India initiative aimed at boosting investment in manufacturing sector.",
