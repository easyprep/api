Iran is the country of origin of the wrestling sport \"Pahlevani and zoorkhaneh rituals\".Â  Pahlevani and zourkhaneh rituals is, a traditional system of athletics originally used to train warriors in Iran (Persia) and Afghanistan. It combines martial arts, callisthenics, strength training and music. Recognized by UNESCO as the world's longest-running form of such training, it fuses elements of pre-Islamic Persian culture (particularly Zoroastrianism, Mithraism and Gnosticism) with the spirituality of Shia Islam and Sufism. Practised in a domed structure called the zurkh?neh, training sessions consist mainly of ritual gymnastic movements and climax with the core of combat practice, a form of submission-grappling called koshti pahlavani.",
