  "explanation": "Egypt gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1922. Local dissatisfaction against Khedivate rule leads to the European invasion. In 1822, the United Kingdom invaded Egypt at the Battle Tell El Kebir and occupied the territory militarily. The Denshawai incident of 1906 turned the sentiment of Egyptian against the Britishers. Finally, the Egyptian Revolution of 1919 overthrew Britishers from Egypt and Egypt declared independent in 1922."
