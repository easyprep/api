  "explanation": "The Montreal Protocol is an international treaty designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs). As of now, India has successfully phased out Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and Halons. India has completely phased-out production and consumption of CFCs with effect from 2008 and Halons from 2004. Recently, the government has introduced a fresh plan to phase out Hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) in the period 2017-23. The HCFC is currently used in various sectors including refrigeration, air-conditioning and foam manufacturing. A multilateral fund set up under the Montreal Protocol has approved USD 44.1 million for India's HCFC management plan for the period 2017-23."
