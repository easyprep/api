  "question": "With respect to the recent discovery of the oldest known solid material on Earth, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The discovery proves that stars formed at a steady constant rate about 7 billion years ago.</li>\n<li>The material was discovered in Antarctica.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe scientists have used a new technique of dating materials to identify the oldest known solid sample on earth recently. The material predates he solar system and proves that the stars formed at a rapid rate (‘baby boom’ of new stars) 7 billion years ago instead of a steady constant rate of formation.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe solid material was discovered in Australia. The material is stardust trapped in a meteorite that crashed into earth’s atmosphere about 50 years ago. It is dated to 7 billion years ago. The sun, in comparison, was formed 4.6 billion years ago."
