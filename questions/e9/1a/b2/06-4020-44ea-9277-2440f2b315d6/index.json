  "question": "How photosynthesis and respiration are similar to each other?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Both produce ATP</li>\r\n<li>Both occur in double membrane organelles.</li>\r\n<li>Both are Cyclic metabolic pathways</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is/ are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "<ol>\r\n<li><strong> Both produce ATP</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThis is a correct statement. During photosynthesis it uses the electron transport chain to transport the electrons to convert light energy into chemical energy for it to be stored into ATP and NADPH. In respiration, the aerobic respiration uses the electron transport chain to produce ATP and release energy. So, both processes, photosynthesis and cellular respiration, generate ATP, the cellular \\\"energy currency\\\".\r\n<ol start=\\\"2\\\">\r\n<li><strong> Both occur in double membrane organelles. </strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThis is a correct statement again. Cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondria, oxidation of glucose occurs, energy and carbon dioxide are released It requires oxygen and occurs in both plants and animals, day or night Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplast, reduction occurs, energy and oxygen are released while requiring carbon dioxide\r\n<ol start=\\\"3\\\">\r\n<li><strong> Both are Cyclic metabolic pathways</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThis is also a correct statement. Both photosynthesis and cellular respiration are metabolic pathways (but occur in opposite directions). Both make use of an electron transport system located in a membrane to produce a proton gradient and ATP."
