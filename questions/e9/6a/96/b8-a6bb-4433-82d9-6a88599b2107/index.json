  "option2": "3 only",
  "option3": "2 only",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "3 only",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe PRAGATI platform is a 3 tiered system. It involves the Prime Minister’s office, Union Government Secretaries and the States’ Chief Secretaries in 3 different tiers. It is a public grievance redressal system and stands for “Pro-Active Governance And Timely Implementation”. It aims at bringing transparency and accountability in the digital platform of e-governance.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe members of the 3 tiers meet on the platform for monitoring and reviewing not only central schemes, but also projects that are flagged by the state government. The union level support for state programs is required for holistic development. The listed objectives are grievance redressal, project implementation ad project monitoring.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe platform makes use of geo-spatial technology apart from digital data management and video conferencing for effective functioning. This is to promote cooperative federalism. This will enable the PM to address the officials at the central and state level with up to date information and latest visuals from ground level situation.\n&nbsp;"
