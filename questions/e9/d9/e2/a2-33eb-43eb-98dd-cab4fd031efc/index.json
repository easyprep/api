  "option1": "Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea",
  "option2": "Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf",
  "option3": "Red Sea and Persian Gulf",
  "option4": "Red Sea and Dead Sea",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea",
  "explanation": "Suez Canal is an artificial sea-level waterway which is 193.3 km long constructed between 1859 and 1869 located in Egypt, connecting both the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea through the Isthmus of Suez. It defines the border between Africa and Asia. Port Said and Port Tewfik form the starting point and the ending point of the canal respectively. The canal offers water vessels a more direct route between the North Atlantic and northern Indian oceans via the Mediterranean and Red seas, thus avoiding the South Atlantic and southern Indian oceans and reducing the journey distance from the Arabian Sea to London, for example, by approximately 8,900 kilometres."
