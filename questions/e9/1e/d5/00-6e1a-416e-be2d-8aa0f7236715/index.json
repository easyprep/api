  "question": "Which among the following is most suitable term for plantation crops like bananas, coffee and sugar grown in developing countries?",
  "option1": "Subsistence agriculture",
  "option2": "Import substitution",
  "option3": "Export-based agriculture",
  "option4": "Specialty agriculture",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Export-based agriculture",
  "explanation": "Plantation agriculture almost always means producing food for wholesale processors and for export. Subsistence agriculture is farming solely for the household or local community. Import substitution is the manufacture of goods internally instead of purchasing them from foreign producers. Specialty agriculture requires growing highly specialized crops in generally smaller quantities, such as organics, delicacies, and special varieties. Value-added agriculture is the processing of raw agricultural goods on the farm, such as cheese and wine, to give them additional value."
