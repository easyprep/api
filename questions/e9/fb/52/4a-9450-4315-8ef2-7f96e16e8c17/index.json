  "option3": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 & 2 Only",
  "explanation": "Third statement is incorrect because the government’s ownership in the NIIF is of 49%, which makes it like a sovereign fund with guarantee of the government. This in turn attracts foreign investors besides generating trust among the foreign investors because of sizable government ownership and management. But the NIIF cannot be described as a Sovereign Wealth Fund."
