  "question": "With reference to the army bringing down 130 tonnes of waste from Siachen Glacier, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Temperature affects the ability of wastes to bio-degrade.</li>\n<li>Removing waste from the glacier is a part of standard operating procedure of the army.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe low temperature affects the rate at which the wastes degrade in the glacier. The altitude of the region and accessibility are added challenges to the waste management efforts in the region. Due to the high altitude and low temperatures, slow degradation occurs.   \n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe removal of wastes from the Siachen Glacier is part of the army’s SOP. Every patrol and administrative column in the region is required to bring down wastes. This has been in practice since 2018. The army is looking to increasing the disposal rate to 100 tonnes per year."
