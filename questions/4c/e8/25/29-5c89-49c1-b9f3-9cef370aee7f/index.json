  "option1": "in every week of the year is zero",
  "option2": "is falling in every week of the year",
  "option3": "is both falling and rising in a year",
  "option4": "is constant in every week of the year",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "in every week of the year is zero",
  "explanation": "A zero rate of Inflation obtains necessarily in a year where the annual rate of inflation is both falling and rising in a year.<br />Unexpected inflation tends to hurt those whose money received—in terms of wages and interest payments—does not rise with inflation.<br />Inflation can help those who owe money that can be paid back in less valuable, inflated dollars.<br />Low rates of inflation have relatively little economic impact over the short term. Over the medium and the long term, however, even low rates of inflation can complicate future planning.<br />High rates of inflation can muddle price signals in the short term and prevent market forces from operating efficiently."
