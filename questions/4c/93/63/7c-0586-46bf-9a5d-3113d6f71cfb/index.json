  "question": "Which of the following scientific discoveries was made by C.V Raman?",
  "option1": "Inelastic scattering of light by molecules",
  "option2": "Super Conductivity",
  "option3": "Controlled nuclear fission",
  "option4": "Cyclotron",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Inelastic scattering of light by molecules",
  "explanation": "C.V Raman discovered the Inelastic scattering of light by molecules in 1928, also named as 'Raman effect' Raman scattering is the inelastic scattering of a photon by molecules which are excited to higher vibrational or rotational energy levels. He was the first Indian Physicist to win the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1930. C.V Raman has also been bestowed with the Bharat Ratna Award."
