  "answer": "India's first indigenously designed standard bar of Gold",
  "explanation": "BND stands for Bharatiya Nirdeshak Dravya, is an indigenous Indian standard Gold bar weighing 20gms and with the dimensions of famous \"Parle-G\" Biscuit. It has been jointly developed by the scientists of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) and CSIR-National Physical Laboratory (NPL). With this, Indian jewellers will no longer need to import gold bars to check the purity of ornaments.This will add to the Make in India campaign and will save foreign exchange of nearly 1000 crore per annum as well as minimise dependency on foreign countries. The bars are being minted in denominations of 10g, 50g, 100g, 500g &amp; 1000g by the India Government Mint (IGM), a unit of Security Printing and Minting Corp of India Ltd. The standard gold bars would be nearly 25% cheaper than their imported versions."
