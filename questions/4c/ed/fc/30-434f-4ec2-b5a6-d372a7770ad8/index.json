  "question": "Which space agency has discovered first nearby super-earth planet GJ357d?",
  "option1": "NASA",
  "option2": "Roscosmos",
  "option3": "CNES",
  "option4": "ISRO",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "NASA",
  "explanation": "The NASA scientists have characterized the first potentially habitable world outside our own solar system that may be suitable for life. The super-earth planet — named GJ 357 d — was spotted by NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. It is estimated that planet is about six times the size of our planet and located a mere 31 light-years away. The planet orbits a dwarf star in the Hydra constellation and may have the right conditions to support liquid water as it lies within its star’s habitable zone. It may be noted that a super-Earth is an extrasolar planet with a mass higher than Earth’s, but substantially below those of the Solar System’s ice giants, Uranus and Neptune."
