  "answer": "Montreal Protocol",
  "explanation": "&nbsp; The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is an environmental treaty that was adopted on September 16, 1987 by the international community to protect human health and the environment by phasing out a number of man-made chemicals with adverse effects on the ozone. Initially, it included refrigerants such as CFCs and halons, but the list of controlled chemicals under the Montreal Protocol today includes HCFCs, methyl bromide, and other ozone-depleting substances (ODS). The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) became an implementing agency of the Montreal Protocol in 1992. In 2010, it became the only environmental treaty which enjoys universal ratification of 197 UN member countries. Recently, in September 2017, it celebrated its 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary."
