  "question": "The environment ministry has released ‘Status of Tiger Habitats in high altitude ecosystems’ report. With reference to this, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>High altitude tiger habitats have been studied by the 2018 tiger census.</li>\n<li>Tigers can be found in taiga belts, grasslands and mangrove swamps.</li>\n<li>Bengal tigers can habitat only low altitude habitats.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "All are incorrect",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nOver the years the tiger census had studied only the 18 tiger states for the carnivore’s population determination. The high altitude sites of north-east were excluded even in the 2010 census. In 2018 census, the northeast states were also included for the first time.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe tigers are very versatile and can adapt to a range of habitat types. They can occur at high altitudes and cold taiga regions like those in Far East Russia, tropical forests like in Malaysia and Indonesia, grasslands, mangrove swamps (Sunderbans), etc.\n<strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong>\nBengal tigers have been spotted at very high elevation sites over the years with the frequency increasing in the current few years. Camera traps have recorded Bengal Tiger’s presence at over 4000m altitudes in Bhutan. The scientists say that tigers have historically lived in such habitats and more are migrating to such places in search of prey and safe habitats.\n&nbsp;"
