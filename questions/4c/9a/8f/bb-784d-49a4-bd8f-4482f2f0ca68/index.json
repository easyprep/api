  "answer": "Haryana",
  "explanation": "Haryana has become the first State in India to launch High Risk Pregnancy (HRP) Portal which helps in early identification of high-risk pregnant cases, ensures timely referral of such cases to the civil hospitals for further management and delivery by specialists. High Risk Pregnancy Policy has been implemented across Haryana since November 2017 for identifying 100 per cent name-based high-risk pregnancy cases up to grassroots level, and ensuring their delivery by specialists at civil hospitals. As morbidity and mortality is quite high in high risk pregnant cases, HRP initiative will lead to a decline in Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR), Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and Still Birth Incidence.",
