  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Nomadic herding is primarily an activity of the regions of limited rainfall and low fertility of land where settled agriculture cannot be pursued. Most regions of nomadic herding have an arid or semi-arid climate with a rainfall of less than 50 cm. Thus the direction and time of movement of the nomads is dependent mainly upon the availability of pasture and water."
