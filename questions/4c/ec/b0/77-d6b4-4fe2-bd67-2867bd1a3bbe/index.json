  "question": "In context with the discovery of Koonwara dinosaur fossils in the South Pole region recently, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The fossils contained feathers.</li>\n<li>Melanosomes were present in the fossil.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Koonwara fossil was recently unearthed in Koonwara near the South Pole. Its unique feature is the presence of feathers called protofeathers. This is the first time protofeathers have been discovered at the polar site. These structures kept the ancient life forms warm during the early Cretaceous period.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe protofeathers contains structures called melanosomes. These melanosomes are said to have given color to the protofeathers. The experts suggest that these were possibly black, brown, grey or stripped in appearance. The Koonwara site has been under study since the 1960s."
