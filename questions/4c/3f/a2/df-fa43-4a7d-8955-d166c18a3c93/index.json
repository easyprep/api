  "explanation": "Prorogation is end of a session. A prorogation puts an end to a session. The time between the Prorogation and reassembly is called Recess. Prorogation is end of session and not the dissolution of the house {in case of Lok Sabha, as Rajya Sabha does not dissolve}.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>While adjournment terminates a sitting, prorogation terminates a session. Dissolution terminates the Lok Sabha itself and needs fresh elections.</li>\r\n<li>While adjournment is done by presiding officers {speaker / deputy speaker in Lok Sabha and Chairman / Deputy chairman in Rajya Sabha); prorogation is done by President. Dissolution of Lok Sabha is also done by president.</li>\r\n</ul>"
