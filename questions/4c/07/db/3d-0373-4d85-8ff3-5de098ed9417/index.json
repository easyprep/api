  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "The Guru Granth Sahib starts with the opening verses, known as the mul mantra, which gives a collection of attributes and qualities ascribed to the Supreme Being. After this opening, the it has three main parts<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The first is the Japji, a sequence of thirty-eight poems written by Guru Nanak that is considered the essence of the Sikh faith, and which is recited by the faithful as the morning prayer.</li>\r\n<li>The second section contains the hymns of the Sikh gurus, arranged by raga, or melodic mode. Within each raga the hymns are arranged according to poetic meter, and within each meter the hymns are arranged sequentially according to which of the gurus composed them. Since the Sikh tradition holds that all ten gurus contained the same divine spirit, they all identified themselves as “Nanak.” But introductions to the songs differentiate between them by calling them Mahala (literally “house,” but figuratively “body”) followed by a number— from Mahala 1 for Guru Nanak to Mahala 5 for Guru Arjan.</li>\r\n<li>The final section of the Adigranth contains hymns by various other devotees (bhakta), both Hindu and Muslim, whom the Sikh gurus believed to be propounding the essential Sikh message of monotheism and the need to serve God. Among the Hindu devotional (bhakti) poets whose works can be found in this section are <em><u>Trilochan, Jayadeva, Pipa, Ramananda, Sen, Namdev, Kabir, and Ravidas, with significant collections for the last three. </u></em></li>\r\n</ol>"
