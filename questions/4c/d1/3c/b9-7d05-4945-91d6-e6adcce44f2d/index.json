  "question": "What is the function of a fuse wire?",
  "option1": "To prevent an unduly high electric current from passing through a circuit",
  "option2": "To increase the current supply",
  "option3": "To decrease the current supply",
  "option4": "To stabilise the voltage",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "To prevent an unduly high electric current from passing through a circuit",
  "explanation": "In electronics and electrical engineering, a fuse is an electrical safety device that operates to provide over current protection of an electrical circuit. Its essential component is a metal wire or strip that melts when too much current flows through it, thereby interrupting the current."
