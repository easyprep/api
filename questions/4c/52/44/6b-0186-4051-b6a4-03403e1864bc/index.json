  "question": "With reference to the recent plans to set up ‘Ganga Centralised Aqualab’, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>This is the first such laboratory in India.</li>\n<li>It is to include genetic laboratories.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Ganga Centralised Aqualab is the first aqualab for any river in India. It is to be established in Dehradun at the Wildlife Institute of India. It is a part of the National Mission for Clean Ganga. The lab will cover 2,525km stretch of the river.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Aqualab will include genetic laboratory. This facility will enable the collection of genetic data of the aquatic species present in the river stretch and its tributaries. As 90% of the river water is extracted and the river itself is highly polluted, there is a need to conserve the aquatic life forms in this ecosystem."
