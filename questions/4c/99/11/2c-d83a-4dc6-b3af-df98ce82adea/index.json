  "question": "With regards to the recent comparative analysis of the photovoltaic energy with geothermal energy by IIT Hyderabad, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Quartz mining is necessary for photovoltaic energy generation.</li>\r\n<li>Carbon dioxide emission during energy generation through photovoltaics is more than in geothermal route.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nQuartz is an important mineral used for sourcing silicon. Silicon is needed in the manufacture of photovoltaic cells and its electronic grade is sourced from quartz. 10 tonnes of quartz is required for manufacturing cells to generate 1MW of power from sun.\r\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe scientists at IIT Hyderabad recently compared the impact of generating power from photovoltaics with that from geothermal energy. It was concluded that about 3,312 million kg of carbon dioxide was released during the lifecycle of a solar photovoltaic cell. In case of geothermal energy, 450g of CO2 is released for every kWh generated."
