  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 and 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2",
  "explanation": "Jean Bodin held that Sovereign is above law but not above duty and moral responsibility, therefore, he imposed two important limitations on the powers of the sovereign which are as follows -\r\n1. There are some fundamental laws (such as the Salic law of France which excluded women from dynastic succession) which the sovereign could not lawfully abrogate such laws.\r\n2. Private property is being granted by the natural law of nature, therefore, the sovereign could not tax his subjects without their consent."
