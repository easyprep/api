  "option1": "Germany",
  "option2": "Poland",
  "option3": "France",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Germany",
  "explanation": "Germany has decided to phase out the controversial weedkiller glyphosate by the end of  2023 to protect insect populations that play a pivotal role in ecosystems and pollination of food crops. The chemical is also suspected to cause cancer in humans. The ban is a major blow to German agrochemical manufacturer Bayer CropScience.  Glyphosate is popular in India too where farmers use the chemical as an alternative to expensive manual weeding. Earlier, Austria became the first EU member to ban glyphosate use in July 2019."
