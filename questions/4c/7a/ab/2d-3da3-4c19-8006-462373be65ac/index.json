  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "A social reform body, was founded by swami Dyananda saraswaty in 1875. Under the influence of western education and science many amongst the educated Indians were tending to become Christian. The arya samaj, like the brahma samaj and the prarthana samaj, was started to stop this process and largely succeeded in its efforts. Its motto was “ go back to the Vedas” and it wanted to reform society on the model of the Vedas and discard all later outgrowths. It upheld monotheism, condemned polytheism and the use of image. It was opposed to caste restriction and child marriages and it supported sea-voyage, female education and remarriages of widows. It aimed at uplifting the down-trodden classes or castes amongst the Indians. It claimed that Hinduism was a proselytizing religion and by what is known as the suddhi (purification) movement it converted many non-Hindus to Hinduism and thus gave a new dynamic force to Hinduism. It has done a great deal of social and educational work, especially in the Punjab. At first it confined its educational efforts to sanskritic studies only, but later on one section of it led by Lala Hansraj supported the cultivation of western education as well as founded the dayananda Anglo Vedic college at Lahore. The orthodox section continued to believe in the necessity of reviving the Vedic ideal in modern life and founded the gurukul at haridwar in 1902. It has a still a large following in upper India."
