  "question": "The scientists of India and which country have identified a new gene linked to schizophrenia?",
  "option1": "South Africa",
  "option2": "Russia",
  "option3": "Australia",
  "option4": "Belgium",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Australia",
  "explanation": "After 18 years of research, the scientists from the University of Queensland in Australia and a team of Indian researchers have identified a new gene - called NAPRT1 - directly linked to schizophrenia. Using DNA from thousands of people in India, the team has found clues in the quest for the causes of schizophrenia, and for potential treatments. This study identified a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in vitamin B3 metabolism â€” we were also able to find this gene in a large genomic dataset of schizophrenia patients with European ancestry. The team of Indian researchers was led by R. Thara, co-founder and director of the Chennai-based Schizophrenia Research Foundation. Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels and behaves. People with schizophrenia may seem like they have lost touch with reality."
