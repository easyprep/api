  "question": "The Pusa Yashavi variety was launched by the IARI. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is a hybrid variety of chillies.</li>\n<li>It is resistant to rust fungi.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Pusa Yashavi is a wheat variety developed by the IARI. It is noted for its high protein and gluten content. It is also known as the HD-3226 and has notably high zinc content. The variety is reported to be best for preparation of breads, biscuits and chapatti.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe wheat variety has high resistance against the rust fungi. These fungi affect many varieties of crop plants. A rust fungi infected plant shows shunting and yellowing of the plant parts. It causes the wheat stem rust disease. Since it may use alternate hosts, the complete elimination of the pathogen is difficult."
