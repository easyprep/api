  "question": "The colour of an opaque object is due to the colour it?",
  "option1": "absorbs",
  "option2": "refracts",
  "option3": "reflects",
  "option4": "scatters",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "reflects",
  "explanation": "The apparent color of an opaque object depends on the wavelength of the light that it reflects; e.g., a red object observed in daylight appears red because it reflects only the waves producing red light. The color of a transparent object is determined by the wavelength of the light transmitted by it."
