  "answer": "Germany",
  "explanation": "Germany's strategic naval plan was the \"Naval Order of 24 October 1918\". The naval order of 24 October 1918 was a plan made by the German Admiralty at the end of World War I to provoke a decisive battle between the German High Seas Fleet and the British Grand Fleet in the southern North Sea. When the order to prepare for the sortie was issued on 29 October, a mutiny broke out aboard the German ships. Despite the operation being cancelled, these, in turn, led to the more serious Kiel mutiny, which was the starting point of the November Revolution and the proclamation of the Weimar Republic."
