  "answer": "Know your numbers",
  "explanation": "The World Hypertension Day (WHD) is observed every year on May 17 to spread awareness about the disease that the World Health Organisation (WHO) calls a “silent killer” and “global public health issue”.  The 2019 theme \\\"Know your numbers\\\" is meant to raise awareness about high blood pressure in people across the world. The idea is to make sure you check your blood pressure regularly and know your numbers in order to necessary action on time. Hypertension or high blood pressure is a condition in which there is long-term high force of blood against artery walls. The force is high enough to cause numerous health problems like heart disease and stroke. Blood pressure is determined by the amount of blood heart pumps and the amount of resistance blood flow in arteries. The more blood your heart pumps, the narrower your arteries and the higher your blood pressure."
