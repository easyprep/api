  "explanation": "Dutch photographer Marsel van Oosten has won the prestigious  Wildlife Photographer Of The Year (WPY) 2018 for his  stunning portrait of two endangered golden snub-nosed monkeys in China’s Qinling mountains. The winning image - named as ‘Golden Couple’ -  showcases a beautiful golden fur-blue face male monkey rested briefly on a stone seat, joined by  female baby monkey. The golden snub-nose monkeys are little known outside of their native range of China’s Qinling Mountains. They represent the poorly known primate diversity found in China, much of which is silently sliding toward extinction. The WPY is one of the most prestigious and also the largest wildlife photography competition in the world. Started in 1964, the winning entries and runners-up are published in a book format each year since 1992."
