  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "All are incorrect",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Nar-Par-Tapi project has been a source of conflict between the western states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. The project seeks to divert surplus water from Maharashtra to Gujarat via inter-linking of rivers. Maharashtra is opposed to this and has been planning the construction of 22 dams to divert the water to the eastern portion of the state.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe project consists of the rivers: Par, Narmada, Auranga, Purna, Ambika, Mindhola, Tapi and Kim. The project is to divert water from the west flowing rivers like Par, Ambika, Auranga and Narmada in Maharashtra to service the population in Gujarat. Experts have highlighted the need to review the classification of water surplus and deficit river basins in India in context of the changing climate pattern.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nThe Nar-Par-Tapi is a multipurpose project involving Gujarat and Maharashtra. It will help irrigate the agricultural fields of Gujarat. It will also provide water for drinking and power generation purposes. The Maharashtra government is keen to use the projectâ€™s benefits to aid the water deprived Marathwada region."
