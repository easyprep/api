  "option1": "West Bengal",
  "option2": "Odisha",

  "answer": "West Bengal",
  "explanation": "The World-class autism township will come up near Kolkata, where children and adults suffering from the developmental disorder can receive training, treatment and boarding facilities. It’s a one-of-its-kind initiative in India and will be built as a joint effort by private firm ‘Ratnabali Group’ & the West Bengal government. The estimated cost for building the township has been pegged at Rs 500 crore. Hence, the India Autism Center (IAC) - a non-profit organization under Section 8 of Companies Act, 2013 - is expected to come up over a 52-acre plot at Sirakol in South 24 Parganas by 2023. The IAC will have housing facilities for 350 residents and daycare centre for over 200 children, adolescents and adults. It will also have an administrative wing and a guest house, where parents of those receiving training at the institute can put up for a few days. The soft launch of the project has been scheduled for January 2019."
