  "question": "Which Indian nationalist leader looked upon a war between Germany and Britain as a godsent opportunity which would enable Indians to exploit the situation to their advantage?",
  "option1": "C. Rajagopalachari",
  "option2": "M. A. Jinnah",
  "option3": "Subhas Chandra Bose",
  "option4": "Jawaharlal Nehru",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Subhas Chandra Bose",
  "explanation": "S.C. Bose and the socialists argued that the war was an imperialist one since both sides were fighting for gaining or defending colonial territories. Therefore the question of supporting either of the two sides did not arise. Instead advantage should be taken of the situation to wrest freedom by immediately starting a Civil Disobedience Movement."
