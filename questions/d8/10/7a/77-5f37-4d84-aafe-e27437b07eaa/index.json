  "explanation": "Article 30 provides an absolute right to the minorities that they can establish their own linguistic and religious institutions and at the same time can also claim for grant-in-aid without any discrimination.Â <br /><strong>Can a Madarsa Can be acquired by the Government?<br /></strong> Yes, The article 30(1A) was inserted by the 44th Amendment Act 1978. This article provides that if while making any law which provides for the compulsory acquisition of any property of any educational institution established and administered by a minority, the State shall ensure that the amount fixed by or determined under such law for the acquisition of such property is such as would not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed under that clause. This clause makes it clear that such acquisition requires conformable compensation."
