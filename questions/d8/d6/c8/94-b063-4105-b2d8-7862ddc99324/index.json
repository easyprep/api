  "explanation": "India’s first domestic cruise ‘Angriya’ has recently been flagged off from Mumbai to Goa on October 20 to boost the country’s lagging cruise service sector. The cruise has six decks and 104 cabins. It can ferry 399 passengers at a time. It has eight types of rooms – from dormitories to luxury rooms. The price range of the cruise will be from Rs 7,000 to Rs 12,000 for one-way. The ship will run four times a week, except during monsoons. It is named after India’s first naval commander Admiral Sarkhel Kanhoji Angre, who served in Shivaji’s armament, and who believed one should have a separate Navy to control the waters."
