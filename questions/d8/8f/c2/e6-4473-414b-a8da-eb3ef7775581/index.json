  "question": "Which Mughal King’s coin depicted Swastika?",
  "option1": "Akbar",
  "option2": "Jahangir",
  "option3": "Shah Jahan",
  "option4": "Muhammad Shah",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Akbar",
  "explanation": "Like his ideology, coins of Akbar also reflect secularism. The Hindu symbol of Swastika appears on many of his coins along with the “Kalima” (Islamic affirmation of faith). He also issued gold half mohurs with depictions of Rama and Sita on them. Some silver coins also had the words “Rama” and “Gobind” on them."
