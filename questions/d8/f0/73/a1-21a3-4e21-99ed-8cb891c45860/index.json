  "question": "Which of the following is correct about Brahmaputra River in context of Assam flooding?\n<ol>\n<li>The river, which is the source of floods in Assam, flows through China, Bangladesh, Bhutan and India.</li>\n<li>Subansiri Lower hydroelectric project was intended on the river.</li>\n<li>The flooding is purely man-made in origin.</li>\n<li>It has the highest discharge rate at the mouth among all rivers.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:\n&nbsp;",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 3 & 4",
  "option3": "Only 3",
  "option4": "Only 1 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe river flows through India, Bangladesh, Bhutan and China. It has an aggregate basin of 580,000 sq.km spread out among the four countries. It opens out into the Bay of Bengal from Bangladesh. It shows annual flooding events and the river’s nature has played a major role in shaping the geography and biodiversity of the region.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe Subansiri project was a project intended on the Brahmaputra river. It was worth crores of rupees. It involved a gravity dam construction for hydroelectricity generation. The location is Gerukamukh village on the border of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. It has faced many issues like landslides, local opposition, low construction time due to flooding, poor rock conditions etc. The project had been scrapped.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe flooding has both natural and man-made causes. The river is very dynamic in nature and also very unstable. Its geographical location also contributes to flooding- movement from sloped to plains decrease velocity and increases flooding. It has been aggravated by anthropogenic activities like unsustainable constructions, deforestation etc. many proposed measure like dam construction has not yielded results. Embankment is now being proposed for implementation.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe river doesn’t have the highest but, one of the highest discharge rates in the world. Amazon, Congo and Yangtze hold the top three spots while Brahmaputra holds the fourth spot. It has a discharge rate of 19,830 cubic meters per second. It also has very high sedimentation rate. Eg: 1,128 tonnes per sq.km at certain regions of Bangladesh."
