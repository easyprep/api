  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe secretariat of the CDRI is to be established as a society under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. The cabinet has given ex-post facto approval for its setup. India has promised 480 crore INR for this global project. This is to be launched during the UN Climate Summit in New York.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Sendai Framework was adopted in 2015 during the 3<sup>rd</sup> UN World Conference. It is a non-binding agreement on disaster risk reduction. In a departure from preceding frameworks, the Sendai framework focuses on risk management. The government’s plan to set up the CDRI is expected to contribute to the framework’s goal of risk reduction."
