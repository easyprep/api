  "answer": "Georgia",
  "explanation": "Georgia's intangible cultural heritage is \"Perkhuli Dance\". Perkhuli is a Georgian predominantly male folk round dance. Of at least 20 versions of the dance, \"multi-level\" perkhuli is one of the most popular forms, performed by a group of dancers standing on the other group's shoulders, with music in 3/4 time. Another version of perkhuli consists of slow and fast rounds danced to music in 4/4 time. The northwestern mountainous region of Svaneti is particularly rich in the perkhuli repertoire. The dance was inscribed on the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Georgia list in 2013."
