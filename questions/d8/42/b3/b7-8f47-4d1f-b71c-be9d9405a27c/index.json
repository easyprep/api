  "question": "\"Svedberg Unit” is a unit of _________?",
  "option1": "Concentration",
  "option2": "Size",
  "option3": "Density",
  "option4": "Time",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Time",
  "explanation": "Svedberg unit (S/ Sv) is a unit for sedimentation coefficients. It offers a measure of size of the particle based on sedimentation rate under acceleration. It calculates how fast the particle settles to the bottom of the solution. Svedberg unit is a measure of time (exactly 10−13 seconds)."
