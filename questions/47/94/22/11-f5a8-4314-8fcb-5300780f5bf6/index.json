  "question": "Which of the following is / are reasons of the highest salinity of ocean water in Red Sea?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Low Precipitation and high Evaporation</li>\r\n<li>Little connection with open ocean</li>\r\n<li>Coriolis Force</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Higher the rate of evaporation, higher is salinity. The Highest evaporation has been recorded along the tropic of Cancer and that is one of the reasons that region of Red Sea and Persian Gulf has one of the highest salinity. Another reason is that enclosed seas tend to have more salinity in their water. The salinity of the Red Sea is greater than the world average, approximately 4 percent. Generally, the factors include:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>High rate of evaporation and very little precipitation.</li>\r\n<li>Lack of significant rivers or streams draining into the sea.</li>\r\n<li>Limited connection with the Indian Ocean, which has lower water salinity.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nCoriolis Force is not a factor to increase salinity of red sea."
