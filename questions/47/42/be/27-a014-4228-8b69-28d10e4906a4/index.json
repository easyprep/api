  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "The Sagar Port Project is a deepwater port development project at Sagar Island in West Bengal. It has been in the news for more than 15 years to supplement operations at Calcutta and Haldia, which cannot handle big ships because of the shallow draught of the Hooghly River. A special purpose vehicle (SPV), Bhor Sagar Port Limited (BSPL) has been created for execution of the project. The SPV is a joint venture (JV) between Kolkata Port Trust holding and the West Bengal government. Under the project, a road-cum-rail bridge is proposed over the river Muriganga to connect the Sagar Island to the mainland."
