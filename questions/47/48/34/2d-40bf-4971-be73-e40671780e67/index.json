  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "Both are incorrect statements<br> First statement is incorrect because it is not a GM (genetically modified) crop. Second statement is incorrect because it is a zinc- rich rice plant developed by the Indian&nbsp;Institute of Rice Research&nbsp;(IIRR). Zinc is important for the body because over 300 enzymes in our body use zinc as an essential component in their action. Zinc is essential in supporting our immune system, in synthesising (and degrading) DNA, in wound healing and several other activities.&nbsp;"
