Lakshmi, 51, who first officiated as a match referee in domestic women\\'s cricket in 2008-09, has overseen three women\\'s ODI matches and three women\\'s T20 International matches. Her compatriot Claire Polosak recently became the first female umpire to officiate in a men\\'s One-Day International (ODI). In another major appointment, Australia\\'s Eloise Sheridan has joined Polosak on the ICC Development Panel of Umpires, meaning the number of women on that panel is now up to eight. Lauren Agenbag, Kim Cotton, Shivani Mishra, Sue Redfern, Mary Waldron and Jacqueline Williams are the other women officials on that panel."
