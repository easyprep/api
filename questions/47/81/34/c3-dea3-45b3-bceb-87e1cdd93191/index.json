  "question": "In context with the recent discussions about Cyclone Pawan, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is originated in Indian Ocean.</li>\n<li>The cyclone made landfall in the Maldives.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nCyclone Pawan originated in the northern portion of Indian Ocean. It is the 8<sup>th</sup> cyclone in the IOR. It is the 5<sup>th</sup> cyclone in the Arabian Sea as it moved into the western waters off India’s coast. So far 9 cyclones have formed in the region- the highest since 1976.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nCyclone Pawan did not make landfall in Maldives. It has moved towards the African coast and is expected to make landfall in Somalia. It has brought light showers along the western coast of India, like in Gujarat. Studies suggest that given the increasing temperature of the Indian Ocean waters, the frequency of the cyclones is to increase."
