  "question": "Consider the following statements:<br />1. During the process of osmosis, the solvent travels from the concentrated solution to the dilute solution.<br />2. In the reverse osmosis, external pressure is applied to the dilute solution.<br />Which of the statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 only",
  "option2": "2 only",
  "option3": "Both 1 and 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2",
  "explanation": "• Osmosis is the movement of solvent particles across a semipermeable membrane from a dilute solution into a concentrated solution. The solvent moves to dilute the concentrated solution and equalize the concentration on both sides of the membrane.<br />• Reverse Osmosis works by using a high pressure pump to increase the pressure on the salt side of the RO and force the water across the semi-permeable RO membrane, leaving almost all (around 95% to 99%) of dissolved salts behind in the reject stream."
