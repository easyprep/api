  "question": "&nbsp; &nbsp; Consider the following statements about Tulsidas and Surdas: <ol> <li>While Tulsidas was a devotee of Lord Ram, Surdas was a devotee of Krishna</li> <li>While Tulsidas is considered as Sagun bhakti saint, Surdas is considered as Nirguna bhakti saint</li> </ol> &nbsp; &nbsp;Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "Second statement is incorrect because Surdas is considered a Saguna bhakti poet and so also known as Sant Surdas, a name which literally means the &quot;servant of melody&quot;.&nbsp; Nirguna saints&nbsp;(Kabir, Nanak, Dadu Dayal, Namdev) were not limited to any particular sect or religion in their following and in their ideas (thus were able to win followers among both Hindus and Muslims). But&nbsp;Sagun saints&nbsp;(Tulsidas, Mira, Chaitanya, and Vallabhacharya) were tied to their particular sect."
