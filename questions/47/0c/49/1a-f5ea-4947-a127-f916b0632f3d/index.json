  "answer": "China",
  "explanation": "China is the world's largest Carbon dioxide (CO2) emitter. China emits 10877.218 Mt CO2/Year fossil CO2 emissions. Since China is the country with the largest population in the world, it emits more CO2 than any other country. But taking into account CO2 emissions per person, China's levels are less than half those of the USA. China ranks second after India with the highest death toll because of air pollution."
