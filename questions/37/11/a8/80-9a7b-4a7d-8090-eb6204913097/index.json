  "question": "With reference to the recent efforts to revise the National List of Essential Medicines, consider the following statements about WHOâ€™s AWaRe tool:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The Watch group of antibiotics in the AWaRe tool should be used only as a last resort.</li>\r\n<li>Colistin is included in the Reserve group of AWaRe.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe AWaRe is a tool introduced by WHO to guide policy makers while tackling the issue of antibiotic resistance. The resistance is mainly evolved due to misuse and improper planning of antibiotics use. It has 3 categories of antibiotics with guidance about when each is to be used- Access, Watch and Reserve. Reserve group is to be used only as a last resort.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe Colistin is added under the Reserve category. It is to be used only as a means of last resort. The antibiotics under Access group needs to be made available at all times while those under the Watch group is used more sparingly."
