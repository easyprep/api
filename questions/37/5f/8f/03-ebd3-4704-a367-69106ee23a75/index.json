  "answer": "Indian Wild Ass",
  "explanation": "The wild ass, locally known as ghudkhar and found only in the Little Rann of Kutch in Gujarat in India, has been classified as an endangered animal. The Red List of International Union For Conservation of Nature (IUCN) released recently moved the wild ass from the &#8216;vulnerable&#8217; to &#8216;endangered&#8217; category, indicating the need for heightened protection measures. The IUCN added that the population of the Asiatic wild ass has declined by an alarming 52% in the past 16 years.<br> In Gujarat, there are 4,451 wild asses as per the 2014 census. In 2004, their number was 3,863. Principal chief conservator of forest H C Pant said, &#8220;Gujarat has recorded a 10% rise in numbers especially in the past five years. This change in classification must be prompted by the decline in their population across the world.&#8221; {Source: <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/Wild-ass-now-an-endangered-species/articleshow/48632883.cms#\">Times of India</a>}"
