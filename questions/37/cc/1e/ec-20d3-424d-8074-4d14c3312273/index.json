  "option4": "Norway",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Iceland",
  "explanation": "Iceland houses the road tunnel \"Hvalfjordur Tunnel\". It is a road tunnel under the Hvalfjordur fjord in Iceland and a part of Route 1. Opened on 11 July 1998, it shortens the distance from Reykjavik to the western and northern parts of the island by 45 kilometres. Passing the fjord now takes 7 minutes instead of about an hour. This project was a milestone in Icelandic construction as it was the first private finance initiative without direct funding by the state treasury. It is also the only tunnel where tolls were charged.",
