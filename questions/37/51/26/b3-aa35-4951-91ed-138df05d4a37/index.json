  "option1": "Only 1 & 4",
  "option2": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 3",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 4",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:<br />The 2018 policy classified biofuels into two categories of basic and advanced biofuels. The basic biofuels are also called first generation (1G) biofuels and will include bioethanol and biodiesel. The advanced biofuel category includes second generation biofuels like ethanol and municipal wastes and third generation biofuels like bio-CNG. This categorisation is to facilitate appropriation of funding and incentives suitable to each category.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe National Policy on Biofuels seeks to increase the percentage of ethanol in petrol from current levels of 2% to 20% in 2030. In the same period, the proportion in diesel is sought to be increased from 0.1% to 5%. Though ethanol is more environmentally friendly than petrol and diesel, its performance as a fuel is limited. Hence the government seeks to introduce it in steps while simultaneous improvement in technology for ethanol use takes place.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe first ethanol refinery in Maharashtra will make use of rice straw to produce ethanol. The choice of this raw material will reduce the stubble burning. Ethanol can be produced from many plant and animal sources. Ethanol can also be produced from sugarcane, fruits, seeds, etc by fermentation process.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is correct:\nThe refinery will be set up in Vidharba region by BPCL/ Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited.  The state owned Petroleum Corporation has become increasingly involved in renewable and green energy sector. It is also involved in solar energy, wind energy and also is experimenting on hydrogen based energy. The Vidharba refinery is worth 1500 crore INR."
