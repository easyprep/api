  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "Gram Sabha is a body consisting of persons registered in the electoral rolls comprised within the area of Panchayat at the village level. In the Panchayat Raj System Gram Sabha is the only permanent unit. Duration of Panchayat i.e. Mukhiyas and other members of Panchayat continue for 5 years only from the date appointed for the first meeting, but the villagers do not change. The three tier Panchayat Institutions consist of a Gram Panchayat at the lowest level, Panchayat samiti at the Block level and Zila Parishad of the District level. Thus, Gram Sabha is not a tier."
