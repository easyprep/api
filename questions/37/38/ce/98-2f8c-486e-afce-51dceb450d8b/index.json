  "question": "How the Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is different from Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The major component of CNG is Methane, while major component of LNG is butane</li>\r\n<li>CNG has greater thermal efficiency than LNG</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "The major difference between Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is that the former is Not liquefied. CNG involved compressing the natural gas to less than 1% of the volume it occupies at standard atmospheric pressure. It is stored and distributed in hard containers at a pressure of 200–248 bar (2900–3600 psi), usually in cylindrical or spherical shapes. LNG is involves liquefying natural gas temporarily to liquid form, which is 1/600th the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state, for ease of storage or transportation. Natural gas is a gas consisting primarily of methane, so both CNG and LNG mainly have Methane as component."
