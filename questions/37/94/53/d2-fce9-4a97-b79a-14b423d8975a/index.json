  "answer": "Guinea-Bissau",
  "explanation": "Guinea-Bissau houses the headquarters of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). The African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde is a political party in Guinea-Bissau. Originally formed to a peaceful campaign for independence from Portugal, the party turned to armed conflict in the 1960s and was one of the belligerents in the Guinea-Bissau War of Independence. Towards the end of the war, the party established a socialist one-party state, which remained intact until multi-party democracy was introduced in the early 1990s. Although the party won the first multi-party elections in 1994, it was removed from power in the 1999â€“2000 elections. However, it returned to office after winning parliamentary elections in 2004 and presidential elections in 2005, since which it has remained the largest party in the National People's Assembly.",
