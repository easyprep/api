  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct. Second statement is incorrect because the implementation of scheme would receive the Central Government funding in the form of grant-in-aid, normally not more than the equity being put in by the implementing agency or 50% of the total equity in the project. Also, the grant in aid would be subject to a ceiling of Rs 20 Cr for each infrastructure project. Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) scheme would provide assistance for setting up and up-gradation of infrastructure projects with overwhelming export linkages like the Border Haats, Land customs stations, quality testing and certification labs, cold chains, trade promotion centres, dry ports, export warehousing and packaging, SEZs and ports/airports cargo terminuses.
