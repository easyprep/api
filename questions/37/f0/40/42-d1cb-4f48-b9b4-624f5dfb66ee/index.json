  "question": "With reference to the importance of wildlife corridor in protection of species from climate change highlighted by recent study, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Absence of linear infrastructure reduces the conflict between faster and slower adapting species.</li>\n<li>Dispersal is a tool used by animals to survive climate change.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nLinear infrastructure refers to man-made structures like roadways, railways and fences. The study by scientists in Canada and France reports that the absence of linear infrastructure allows for well-functioning wildlife corridor. This in turn reduces conflict between species that adapt at different rates.Â \n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nWith reference to the ongoing climate change phenomenon, the animal species can do two things: disperse to more favourable habitats or adapt to the changing environmental conditions. For the dispersal mechanism, the wildlife corridors are very important."
