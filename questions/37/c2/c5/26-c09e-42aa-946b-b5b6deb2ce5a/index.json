  "question": "With reference to the coal gasification plant for urea project in Odisha entering into the next phase of establishment, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>In India, urea is produced only from domestic natural gas.</li>\n<li>The plant is to use petcoke for urea production.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nCurrently India uses pooled natural gas for urea production. The pooled natural gas has both domestic natural gas and the imported LNG. The imported LNG component makes it expensive and also adds to India’s overdependence on petroleum imports. The project will seek to use domestic feedstock for urea production.\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe plant at Odisha’s Angul will make use of an indigenous raw material mix. This will consist of coal and petcoke (petroleum coke). The plants will gasify coal to produce syngas, urea, ammonia, etc. the plant will source the coal from the Talcher region and the petcoke from Paradip refinery.\n&nbsp;"
