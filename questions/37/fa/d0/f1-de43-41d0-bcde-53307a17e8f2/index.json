  "question": "What is the probability of finding an electron at a point within an atom?",
  "option1": "proportional to the square of the orbital wave function",
  "option2": "proportional to the orbital wave function",
  "option3": "proportional to the twice of the orbital wave function",
  "option4": "proportional to the cube of the orbital wave function",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "proportional to the square of the orbital wave function",
  "explanation": "The probability of finding an electron at a point within an atom is proportional to the square of the orbital wave function i.e., ψ|<sup>2</sup> at that point. |ψ|<sup>2</sup> is known as probability density and is always positive."
