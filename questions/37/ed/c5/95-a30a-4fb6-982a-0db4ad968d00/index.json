  "question": "Which among the following can produce virtual image?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Converging lens</li>\r\n<li>Concave Mirror</li>\r\n<li>Flat Mirror</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Real images can be produced by concave mirrors and converging lenses. But a converging lens and concave mirror are also capable of producing virtual images if the object is within the focal length. Flat mirrors can never produce real image because, rays never really converge."
