  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because the “Ramanujan Fellowships” is open to brilliant scientists and engineers from all over the world who are below the age of 45 years and not for up to 27 years of age. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u> because the duration of the fellowship is for five years and not six years. To avail the fellowship the applicant should possess a higher degree or equivalent such as PhD in science/engineering/medicine. The fellowships granted under the scheme are very selective and are given based on outstanding track-record as evident from applicant’s research publications. The Ramanujan Fellow is entitled to a Fellowship of Rs.85, 000/per month and in addition a Research Grant of Rs.7.00 Lakh per annum."
