  "question": "Consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>If there were no atmosphere, Sun would have looked white and sky have looked black</li>\r\n<li>If earth stops rotating on its axis, the oceans would migrate toward the poles</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air. However, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue. If there was no atmosphere, sky would look black and sun would look white. The second statement is also correct.
