  "question": "Consider the following statements: <br />1. Fast Breeder Reactors typically contain Plutonium isotope as fuel <br />2. The Fast Breeder Reactors donâ€™t need slow neutrons for sustaining chain reaction<br />Which among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Fast reactors more deliberately use the uranium-238 as well as the fissile U-235 isotope used in most reactors. If they are designed to produce more plutonium than the uranium and plutonium they consume, they are called fast breeder reactors (FBRs). Fast breeders do not require moderation since the neutrons need to be moving fast."
