  "question": "With respect to the recent directions from the RBI to increase security of card transactions, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The RBI has directed the card issuers to cease the ‘card not present’ transaction facilities.</li>\n<li>The card holders will be able to modify transaction limits.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Reserve Bank of India had recently issued directives to credit card issuers to increase security of card based transactions. The issuers are to provide both ‘card present’ and ‘card not present’ transaction facilities. In the former, the credit card is needed for the transaction via ATMs or PoS machines. In the latter, card number and CCV would suffice.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe card issuers are to enable the card holders to modify and set transaction limits of their credit card within the overall limits of the card. The card holder should also be able to switch the facility on or off. The directions were issued under the Payments and Settlement Systems Act, 2007."
