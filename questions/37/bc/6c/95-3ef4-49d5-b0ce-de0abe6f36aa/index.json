  "option4": "Chimpanzee",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Loris",
  "explanation": "Loris is the answer. They have very sharp needle-like teeth on their lower jaw, shaped like a spade. Their bite is so painful and agonizing that they can create extreme allergic reactions (up to anaphylactic shock), followed by Hematuria, which is a reaction to the allergen. Their elbows plays an important part as a lethal weapon, in their defense mechanism. On the inside of the elbows, lies a patch which is used to store a foul smelling toxin. Right before the toxic biting, the loris will suck some poison from the patch and mix it with their saliva, inside their mouth."
