  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nIt is to be used for mapping purposes. It is reported to be the satellite with the highest resolution in India. It has a ground resolution of 25cm and its optical images are to aid in infrastructure planning, utility management, land use regulation, etc.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe CARTOSAT-3 is to function from the sun synchronous orbit. Also known as the heliosynchronous orbit, its orientation is almost like that of a polar orbit. It is referred to as a quasi-polar orbit. It maintains a fixed relation with the sun."
