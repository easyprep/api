  "question": "With respect to the natural gas, how the \"sour gas\" is different from \"sweet gas\"?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>While sour gas contains hydrogen sulphide in significant amount, sweet comprises significant amount of carbon dioxide</li>\r\n<li>In comparison to sour gas, sweet gas is easy to refine</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "A sour gas is any gas that specifically contains hydrogen sulfide in significant amounts, whereas an acid gas is any gas that contains significant amounts of acidic gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) or hydrogen sulfide. Thus, carbon dioxide by itself is an acid gas, not a sour gas. Natural gas that does not contain significant amounts of hydrogen sulfide is called “sweet gas.”"
