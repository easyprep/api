  "question": "With reference to the recent report on India’s district courts from Tata Trusts and Vidhi Centre, consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>Most of the district courts in India have helpdesks and guide maps (&gt;50%).</li>\n<li>Most of the district courts have infrastructure for easy access by the differently abled.</li>\n<li>The district courts are evaluated based on benchmark set by the National Court Managements and Systems Committee</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "2 only",
  "option2": "1 and 3",
  "option3": "3 only",
  "option4": "2 and 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "3 only",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong> Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe report found major deficiencies in the district court infrastructure. A major issue was the courts’ accessibility. Of the more than 600 district courts surveyed, only 20% had guide maps. Only 45% of the district courts had helpdesks to aid the public. These issues about infrastructural deficiencies are often eclipsed by larger looming issues facing the judiciary, like pendency and personnel shortage.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe study found that very little had been done to make district courts accessible for the differently abled. Only 27% of the courts provide for ramps and lifts to help the disabled. A mere 11% of the courts provide washroom facilities for the differently abled. A poorly 2% has visual aids features for the physically challenged.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nIn 2012, the Supreme Court had constituted the National Court Managements and Systems committee. The committee was to identify ways to upgrade the court management system and set standards. The study by the Tata Trusts and the Vidhi centre for legal policy is based on these standards. The report is titled, “Building Better Courts: Surveying the Infrastructure of India’s District Courts”."
