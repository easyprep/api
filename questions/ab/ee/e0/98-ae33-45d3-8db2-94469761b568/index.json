  "explanation": "Maharashtra became the first state in the country to adopt the Fly Ash Utilization Policy. The policy seeks 100% use of fly ash generated from thermal power plants and biogas plants for construction activities. It facilitates use of fly ash to make bricks, blocks, tiles, wall panels, cement and other construction materials. The policy extends use of fly ash to 300 Kms radius of power plant from earlier 100 kms radius of power plant. It will help in environment protection and save soil excavation. It also will make available raw material for construction at low cost to help &lsquo;Housing for All' projects. It will also help create new employment opportunities in the power plant sector and pave way for prosperity by generating Wealth from Waste."
