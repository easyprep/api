Many of these people are concentrated in the Middle East and in particular in Iraq and Syria, where ISIS’s advance and the Syrian civil war have driven many people from their homes. A third of the world’s refugees come from those two nations alone. More than 9.5 million Syrians, or 43 percent of the Syrian population, are currently displaced."
