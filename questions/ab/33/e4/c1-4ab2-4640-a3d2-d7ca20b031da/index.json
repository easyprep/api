  "answer": "Heavy rains",
  "explanation": "Rain water is considered the purest form of water. Impurities and salts present in water on earth are left behind during vaporisation by the sun. However, the rainwater we receive on earth is not necessarily pure, as it brings down impurities and particles present in the atmosphere along with it."
