  "question": "Which Indian organisation has developed an artificial leaf to create fuel from sunlight?",
  "option1": "Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)",
  "option2": "Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Pune",
  "option3": "IIT Kharagpur",
  "option4": "Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Pune",
  "explanation": "The researchers at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-National Chemical Laboratory in Pune have developed an artificial leaf that absorbs sunlight to generate hydrogen fuel from water, an advance that may provide clean energy for powering eco-friendly cars in the future. The device consists of semiconductors stacked in a manner to simulate the natural leaf system. When visible light strikes the semiconductors, electrons move in one direction, producing electric current. The current almost instantaneously splits water into hydrogen â€“ which researchers believe is one of the cleanest forms of fuel as its main byproduct is water."
