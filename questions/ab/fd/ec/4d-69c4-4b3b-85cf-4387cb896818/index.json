  "explanation": "Puri Jagannath temple is dedicated to Lord Jagannath, a form of lord Vishnu and is located in Odhisa. The present temple was rebuilt from the 10th century onwards, on the site of an earlier temple, and begun by King Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva, first of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. The temple is famous for its annual Rathyatra in which the three principal deities are pulled on huge and elaborately decorated temple cars. The idol of Jagannath is made of wood and is ceremoniously replaced every twelve or nineteen years by an exact replica. The Jagannath Temple of Puri is a hallmark of Nagara School of architecture.
