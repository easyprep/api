  "option2": "BRICS",
  "option3": "SAARC",

  "answer": "G-20 Countries",
  "explanation": "After the global financial crisis of 2007, the G-20 has created an institution called Financial Stability Board to design sophisticated regulation measures for banks to prevent future bank failure. Beside this, the central banks of each country identify Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs). While the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) started to identify big banks which are named as Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs). The criteria for selecting D-SIBs are similar to that of G-SIFIs. In India, the RBI has identified SBI and ICICI as D-SIBs. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), in consultation with Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) publishes the list of Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs)."
