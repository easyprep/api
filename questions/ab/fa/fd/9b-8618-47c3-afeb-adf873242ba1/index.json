  "question": "Recently, scientists have come up with hypotheses to explain how the ‘Snowball Earth’ sustained life. In this context, consider the following statements about Snowball Earth hypothesis:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Only the oceans were covered with ice during the Snowball Earth phase.</li>\n<li>The oceans were anoxic during this phase.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Snowball Earth is a phase of earth that saw both its lands and oceans covered by ice. This was the condition from the poles all the way to the tropics. This phase featured two ice ages. It extended from 720- 635 million years ago to about half a billion years ago.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe oceans were isolated from the atmosphere by a continuous layer of ice on its surface. Yet the waters were not anoxic. The ocean had sufficient oxygen to support life forms which were confined to the marine ecosystem during this phase. The studies suggest oxygen rich melt-water streams to be the source of the gas."
