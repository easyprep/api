  "question": "Who among the following Sultans of Delhi issued copper coins instead of silver and gold coins?",
  "option1": "Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq II",
  "option2": "Firoz Shah Tughlaq",
  "option3": "Mohammad-bin Tughlaq",
  "option4": "Muhammud Shah Tughlaq",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Mohammad-bin Tughlaq",
  "explanation": "Muhammad Tughlaq had introduced gold coins (Dinar) and silver coins (Adl or Adlis). However, it was difficult to maintain the supply of gold and silver coins on a large scale. Consequently, Tughlaq replaced those coins and started the circulation of copper and brass coins as the token currency which had the same value of gold or silver coins in 1330-32 CE. But, he failed in  his attempt due to absence of security on coins, central mint and forgery of coins. The newly issued coins began to be devalued in markets and situation became worse. Then, at last, Sultan had to cancelled his farman and withdraw the token currency from market by  exchanging it from silver pieces."
