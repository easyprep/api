  "question": "Which among the following represent both magnitude and direction?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Frequency of house current</li>\r\n<li>Mass of a stone</li>\r\n<li>Displacement</li>\r\n<li>Velocity</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "option3": "Only 1, 3 & 4",
  "option4": "Only 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "This question is asking about the difference scalar and vector quantities. A scalar quantity has only magnitude and is completely specified by a number and a unit. Examples are mass (a stone has a mass of 2 kg), volume (a bottle has a volume of 1.5 liters), and frequency (house current has a frequency of 50 Hz). Scalar quantities of the same kind are added by using ordinary arithmetic. A vector quantity has both magnitude and direction. Examples are displacement (an airplane has flown 200 km to the southwest), velocity (a car is moving 60 km/h to the north), and force (a person applies an upward force of 25 newtons to a package). Symbols of vector quantities are printed in boldface type (v = velocity, F = force). When vector quantities of the same kind are added, their directions must be taken into account."
