  "question": "Consider the following bacteria:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Rhizobium</li>\r\n<li>Azotobacter</li>\r\n<li>Anabaena</li>\r\n<li>Nostoc</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above fix nitrogen without being in symbiotic relation with other biota?",
  "option1": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 4",

  "answer": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "Two kinds of nitrogen-fixing bacteria are recognized:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Free-living (non-symbiotic) bacteria, including the cyanobacteria (or blue-green algae) Anabaena and Nostoc and genera such as Azotobacter, Beijerinckia, and Clostridium;</li>\r\n<li>Mutualistic (symbiotic) bacteria such as Rhizobium, associated with leguminous plants (e.g., various members of the pea family), and certain Azospirillum species, associated with cereal grasses.</li>\r\n</ul>"
