There was a select committee of the House of Commons established around 1830 in which in 1832, Raja Ram Mohan Roy was also invited to give his views on settlement of Europeans in India. Raj Ram Mohan Roy expressed the views that the educated Europeans of &#8220;character and capital&#8221; should be not only permitted but also encouraged to settle in India. All the restrictions in this kind of settlements were removed by the Charter Act of 1833."
