  "question": "The proposed Wholesale &amp; Long-Term Finance Banks (WLTF): <ol> <li>cannot accept saving deposits</li> <li>will raise fund by issuing rupee denominated bonds, locally as well as in abroad</li> <li>require to maintain 40 percent of their branches in rural areas</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is correct</u> because the proposed Wholesale &amp; Long-Term Finance Bank (WLTF) banks cannot accept the saving deposits and can accept only current account and term deposits of at least Rs 10 crore. <u>Second statement is again correct</u> because these banks are allowed to raise money through rupee denominated bonds issued locally as well as abroad. <u>Third statement is incorrect</u>. These banks will be exempted from opening branches in rural and semi-urban areas and will not be forced to lend to agriculture and weaker sections of the society. The Wholesale and Long-Term Finance (WLTF) banks, as proposed in the paper, will focus primarily on lending to infrastructure sector and small, medium and corporate businesses. The eligibility criteria of promoters for a Wholesale and Long-term Finance Bank (WLTFB) will be the same as that for universal banking licence. Raising funds from selling rupee denominated bonds locally or abroad will be a major source of funds for WLTFBs. WLTFBs will also have to maintain cash reserve ratio (CRR) like other commercial banks but do not require to maintain statutory liquidity ratio (SLR)."
