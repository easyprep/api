  "question": "Which of the following are the limitations of Bohr's model of atom?",
  "option1": "it cannot explain spectrum of atoms containing more than one electron",
  "option2": "it cannot explain the Zeeman effect",
  "option3": "it cannot explain the Stark effect",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "Bohrâ€™s model of atom cannot explain spectrum of atoms containing more than one electron. Also, it cannot explain the Zeeman effect i.e. splitting of spectral line in presence of magnetic field. It also fails to explain Stark effect i.e. splitting of spectral line in presence of electric field."
