  "question": "In a majority of flowering plants, out of the four megaspores, what is the ratio of functional and degenerate megaspores?",
  "option1": "2:2",
  "option2": "1:3",
  "option3": "4:1",
  "option4": "3:1",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1:3",
  "explanation": "At least one of the spores develop into haploid female gametophytes thus making the ratio of functional and degenerate megaspores is 1:3. Out of the four, three megaspores degenrate."
