  "question": "&nbsp;Consider the following statements about Delta and Estuary formation in India: <ol> <li>While most of the deltas are formed on the eastern coast of India, estuaries are formed on the west coast</li> <li>The wider plains on the eastern coast in comparison to western coast support delta formation on the coast</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The&nbsp;plains&nbsp;along&nbsp;the east coast&nbsp;are much&nbsp;wider than&nbsp;those on the&nbsp;west coast&nbsp;and contain prominent river deltas like that of the Mahanadi. The wider plains and lower gradient on the eastern coast favours delta formation in the region."
