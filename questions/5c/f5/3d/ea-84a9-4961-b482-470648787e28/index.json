  "question": "How many molecules of water Gypsum has, as a water of crystallisation?",
  "option1": 4,
  "option2": 2,
  "option3": 7,
  "option4": 9,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 2,
  "explanation": "Gypsum has two molecules of water as water of crystallisation. So, the chemical formula for hydrated gypsum becomes CaSO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O. This gypsum on getting heated loses water molecules and becomes calcium sulphate hemihydrate (CaSO<sub>4</sub>.1/2H<sub>2</sub>O). This is known as plaster of Paris."
