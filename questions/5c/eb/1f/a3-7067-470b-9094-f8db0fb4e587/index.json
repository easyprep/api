  "question": "Which two countries are involved in the \"New River Triangle territorial dispute\"?",
  "option1": "Suriname and Guyana",
  "option2": "Venezuela and Guyana",
  "option3": "Brazil and Guyana",
  "option4": "Colombia and Guyana",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Suriname and Guyana",
  "explanation": "Suriname and Guyana are the two countries that are involved in the \"New River Triangle territorial dispute\". New River Triangle area is known in Suriname as the Tigri area and is known in Guyana as the New River Triangle. Suriname claims the New River Triangle area, which encompasses a mass of land that is larger than the size of Jamaica. The eastern boundary where Guyana, Brazil and Suriname meet was clearly marked out since 1936. Surinameâ€™s claim to the Corentyne River area remains a matter of contention since there has never been a treaty that clearly demarcated the boundary between the neighbouring countries. Both Guyana and Suriname claimed the South East Berbice region.",
