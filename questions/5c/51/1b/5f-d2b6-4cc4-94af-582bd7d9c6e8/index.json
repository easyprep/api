  "question": "Recently, scientists have unveiled the world’s most powerful X-ray machine called European X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL). It is installed in which of the following countries?",
  "option1": "France",
  "option2": "Germany",
  "option3": "Norway",
  "option4": "Switzerland",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Germany",
  "explanation": "World’s One of the most powerful X-ray machines called European X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL has officially opened at Hamburg, Germany. It is capable of firing powerful X-rays in bursts in less than seconds: so short that, like strobe lights, they can capture snapshots of jittery molecules frozen in time, and with a wavelength small enough to provide pictures at atomic resolution. The Hamburg machine is one of a few such X-ray lasers worldwide, but boasts a unique rapid-fire feature: it can rattle off 27,000 pulses every second, a firing rate more than 200 times greater than the next-fastest facility."
