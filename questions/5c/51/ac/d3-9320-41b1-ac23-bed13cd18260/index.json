  "question": "What functions are done by the Statutory Liquidity Ratio?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It is an instrument of credit control;</li>\r\n<li>It works as a cushion against the possibility of bank failures; and</li>\r\n<li>It finances government deficits</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "There are three purposes to keep SLR. These are: <ul><li>It is an instrument of credit control</li><li>It works as a cushion against the possibility of bank failures</li><li>It is a conduit for financing government deficits.</li></ul> We note here that SLR is not very frequently changed; so as an instrument of Credit Control; its role is limited. However, most important function SLR is doing in current times is to &#8220;finance the government deficit&#8221;. As far as its function as a cushion against bank failures is concerned, it is practically meaningless because weak commercial banks are not allowed to fail by the Government/RBI which is guided by the too-big-to-fail doctrine while resolving bank failures."
