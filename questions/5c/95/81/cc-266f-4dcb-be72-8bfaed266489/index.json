  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "All statements are correct in this question. The other name of Allama Mashriqi was Inayatullah Khan and he was a mathematical intellectual. He is known for publishing a pamphlet in which he claimed that Muslims only had the right of being the guardians of Hindustan and No other could claim to govern Hindustan. The organization was declared unlawful in 1940 and Khaksars including Allama Mashriqi were stuffed in Jails. Jinnah had appealed them to support the Muslim league's cause but Khaksar's relation with league were not so friendly. He wanted a Pakistan undivided , stretching from Karachi to Kashmir and did not accept a \"Moth eaten Pakistan\" as per the Mountbatten Plan."
