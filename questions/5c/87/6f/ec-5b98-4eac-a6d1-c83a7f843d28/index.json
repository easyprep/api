  "question": "Consider the following: <ol> <li>Shift from coal-fired tandoors to LPG</li> <li>Afforestation</li> <li>Shift from diesel based vehicles to petrol vehicles</li> </ol> Which of the above will help to reduce PM2.5 from atmosphere?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 2",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "A diesel car emits 5-10 times more PM2.5 than a petrol car and 2-3 times more NOx. Afforestation cannot help in decreasing the PM2.5 level. PM2.5 are tiny particles in the air and not gases (to be reduced by planting trees). The only way to cut its reduction is to cut its emission sources like cars, factories, waste burning and thermal power plants."
