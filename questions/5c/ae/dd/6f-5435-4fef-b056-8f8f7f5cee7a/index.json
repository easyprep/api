  "question": "The positions of the star Polaris, which lies approximately at the north pole of earth changes slowly due to which among the following movements of earth?",
  "option1": "Rotation",
  "option2": "Axial precession",
  "option3": "Orbital Revolution",
  "option4": "Plate Tectonics",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Axial precession",
  "explanation": "The precession of the Earth’s axis has a number of observable effects. First, the positions of the south and north celestial poles appear to move in circles against the space-fixed backdrop of stars, completing one circuit in 25,772 Julian years (2000 rate). Thus, while today the star Polaris lies approximately at the north celestial pole, this will change over time, and other stars will become the “north star”"
