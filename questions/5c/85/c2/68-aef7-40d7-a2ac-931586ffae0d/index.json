  "question": "What is the relation between the orbital velocity and the radius of the orbit for a given planet?",
  "option1": "greater the radius of orbit, lesser will be the orbital velocity",
  "option2": "greater the radius of orbit, greater will be the orbital velocity",
  "option3": "orbital velocity is independent of radius of orbit",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "greater the radius of orbit, lesser will be the orbital velocity",
  "explanation": "For a given planet, greater the radius of orbit, lesser will be the orbital velocity of the satellite. The Orbital velocity depends on the mass of central body and radius of orbit."
