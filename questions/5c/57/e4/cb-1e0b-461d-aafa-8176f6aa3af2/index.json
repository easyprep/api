  "option1": "South Korea &  Japan",
  "option2": "India & Sri Lanaka",
  "option3": "Indian & Bangladesh",
  "option4": "North Korea & South Korea",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "South Korea &  Japan",
  "explanation": "South Korea has recently conducted 2-day drill exercise to practise defending disputed islands off its east coast against an unlikely attack from Japan. The annual drills come just days after Seoul terminated a military intelligence-sharing pact with Tokyo. The exercise will involve warships and aircraft. The drill -- re-named “East Sea territory defence training” -- will solidify the military’s resolve to defend the Dokdo islands and the area surrounding the Sea of Japan. The delayed exercise comes as tensions with neighbouring Japan continue. Seoul has controlled the rocky islets in the Sea of Japan since 1945 when Tokyo’s 35-year colonial rule over the Korean peninsula ended. Tokyo also claims the islands and accuses South Korea of occupying them illegally. The two nations are both market economies, democracies and US allies, and both are threatened by nuclear-armed North Korea."
