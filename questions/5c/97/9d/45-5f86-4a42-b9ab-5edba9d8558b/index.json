  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "They were set up in the year 1985 under the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985. Owing its origin to Article 323-A of the Constitution, Administrative Tribunals adjudicate disputes and complaints with respect to recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to the public service and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union and the States. In pursuance of the provisions contained in the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 the Administrative Tribunals set up under it, exercise original jurisdiction in respect of service matters of employees covered by it. The Administrative Tribunals exercise jurisdiction only in relation to the service matters of the litigants covered by the Act. The aggrieved persons can also appear before it personally. The Government can present its case through its departmental officers or legal practitioners. Thus, the Tribunal provides for speedy and inexpensive justice to the litigants. The Act provides for establishment of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) and the State Administrative Tribunals. The CAT was set-up on 1st November, 1985. Today, it has 17 regular benches, 15 of which operate at the principal seats of High Courts and the remaining two at Jaipur and Lucknow. These Benches also hold circuit sittings at the other seats of High Courts. Earlier the Tribunal consisted of a Chairman, Vice Chairman and Members. With the amendment in Administrative Tribunal Act, 1985 in 2006 the Members have been given the status of judges of High Courts. The Members are drawn both from judicial as well as administrative streams so as to give the Tribunal the benefit of expertise both in legal and administrative spheres. As a result of the judgement dated 18 March, 1997 of the Supreme Court, the appeals against the orders of an Administrative Tribunal shall lie before the Division Bench of the concerned High Court. They were set up in the year 1985 under the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985. Owing its origin to Article 323-A of the Constitution, Administrative Tribunals adjudicate disputes and complaints with respect to recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to the public service and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union and the States. In pursuance of the provisions contained in the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 the Administrative Tribunals set up under it, exercise original jurisdiction in respect of service matters of employees covered by it. The chairman of the Central Administrative Tribunal is either a sitting or a retired judge of a High Court . The provisions of Administrative Tribunals Act don\\'t apply to armed forces."
