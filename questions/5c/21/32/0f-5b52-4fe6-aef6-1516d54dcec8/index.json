  "question": "In which of the following cities one can never see the sun shine overhead at noon?",
  "option1": "Delhi",
  "option2": "Visakhapatnam",
  "option3": "Chennai",
  "option4": "Mumbai",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Delhi",
  "explanation": "Delhi is slightly away from equator, so sun is slightly tilted from being over head. Mumbai and Chennai are south of the tropic of cancer, while Delhi is north of it.<br />Due to the tilt of axis of rotation of the earth, parts of the earth north of the tropic of cancer will never have the noon sun exactly overhead. Parts to itsÂ south will have the noonday sun exactly overhead twice a year, between the time of vernal equinox in March and autumnal equinox in September."
