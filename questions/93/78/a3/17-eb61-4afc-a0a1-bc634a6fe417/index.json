  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Gharials are native to deep, fast-flowing rivers, but prefer calmer areas of these rivers such as river bends. Gharials now remain in only a small fraction of their historical range, in a few areas of India and Nepal. In the past they were found in the river systems of Pakistan, northern India, Bangladesh, and Myanmar and in the lowlands of Bhutan and Nepal. The most important surviving populations are within four tributaries of the Ganges River: The Girwa, Son, and Chambal Rivers in India and the Rapti-Narayani River in Nepal. The most significant breeding population is within the Chambal River, which spans the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh."
