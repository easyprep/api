Soviet Union's Vyborg-Petrozavodsk Offensive of 1944, during the Continuation War, forced the Finnish leadership to sign the Moscow Armistice which demanded Finland to break diplomatic and military ties with Germany and expel any German soldiers from the Finnish region. This war leads to the Finnish victory."
