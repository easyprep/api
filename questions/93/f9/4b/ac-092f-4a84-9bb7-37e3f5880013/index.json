  "answer": "If he intends to resign, the letter of his resignation is to be addressed to the Deputy Speaker",
  "explanation": "The office of the Speaker occupies a pivotal position in our parliamentary democracy. It has been said of the office of the Speaker that while the members of Parliament represent the individual constituencies, the Speaker represents the full authority of the House itself. She is eligible for re-election. On the dissolution of the Lok Sabha, although the Speaker ceases to be a member of the House, she does not vacate her office. The Speaker may, at any time, resign from office by writing under her hand to the Deputy Speaker. The Speaker can be removed from office only on a resolution of the House passed by a majority of all the then members of the House."
