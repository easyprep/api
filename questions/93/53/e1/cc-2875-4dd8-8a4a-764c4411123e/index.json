  "question": "In recent times, the Digital Signatures have become of immense value in internet related communications. What is / are uses of the Digital signature?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>By using digital signature, a sender cannot deny a message which he / she has sent to a receiver</li>\r\n<li>Digital signature can be used a legal proof to ensure that the message was sent by certain sender</li>\r\n<li>Digital signature is used for safe communication between two computers of a closed network</li>\r\n<li>Digital signatures are required to send all email messages</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "There are certain types of encryptions which are used to ensure the authentication. The authentication is done via a password, a Checksum, a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) which is similar to Checksum but little advanced, Private key encryption, which means that the computer has a secret key (code) that it can use to encrypt a packet of information before it is sent over the network to the other computer, a Public key encryption, which is given by a sender’s computer to any computer that wants to communicate securely with it. The key is based on a hash value. In simple language, the digital signature is an authentication of an electronic record by tying it uniquely to a key only a sender knows. This implies that the sender must not be able to deny sending a message that he sent (This is called Nonrepudiation). Thus, digital signatures can be used to: 1.To tie an electronic message to the sender’s identity 2.For non repudiation of communication by a sender 3.To prove that a message was sent by the sender in a court of law"
