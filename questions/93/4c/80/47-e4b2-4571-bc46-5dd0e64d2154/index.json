  "question": "Which of the following represents the conductivity of the solution?",
  "option1": "Cell constant x Resistance",
  "option2": "Cell constant / Resistance",
  "option3": "Cell constant x (Resistance)<sup>2</sup>",
  "option4": "2 x Cell constant x Resistance",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Cell constant / Resistance",
  "explanation": "The conductivity of the solution is given by the equation: Cell constant / Resistance. The conductivity of solutions of different electrolytes in the same solvent and at a given temperature varies due to charge and size of the ions in which they dissociate, the concentration of ions or ease with which the ions move under a potential gradient"
