  "explanation": "Terrigenous deposits are found mainly on the continental shelves and slopes. pelagic deposits - pelagic deposits predominate on the deep sea floor.<br />Terrigenous deposits are composed of coarser materials and are derived from the continents through weathering and erosional processes and are transÂ­ported to the oceans by various agencies.<br />Pelagic deposits consist of fine materials formed of skeletons and shells of marine organisms and a few inorganic substances. They are generally blue, grey or red in colour."
