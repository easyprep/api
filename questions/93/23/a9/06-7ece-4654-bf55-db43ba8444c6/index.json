  "question": "Which among the following take part in the Orogenesis?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Erosion</li>\r\n<li>Sedimentation</li>\r\n<li>Faulting of Rocks</li>\r\n<li>Folding of Rocks</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1, 2 & 4",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "Orogeny is primarily the mechanism by which mountains are built on continents due to the large structural deformation of the Earth&#8217;s lithosphere caused by Plate Tectonics. Orogenesis involves the following: <ul> <li>Structural deformation of the rocks</li> <li>Faulting of rocks</li> <li>Folding of rocks</li> <li>Igneous Processes</li> <li>Metamorphism</li> <li>Glaciation</li> <li>Erosion</li> <li>Sedimentation</li> </ul> We have to note here that the constructive processes, like deformation, folding, faulting, igneous processes and sedimentation build mountains up. On the contrary, the destructive processes like erosion and glaciation, tear them back down again."
