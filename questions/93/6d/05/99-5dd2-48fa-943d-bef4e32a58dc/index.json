  "option5": "",
  "answer": "China",
  "explanation": "In China, the world’s longest 3D-printed concrete bridge has recently opened across a canal on the Wenzaobang River in Shanghai. The bridge is The newly-opened bridge is 26.3 metre-long  and 3.6-meter-wide, and is designed by Professor Xy Weiguo from Tsinghua University in China.  Its design was inspired by an ancient Chinese bridge named “Anji Bridge” in Hebei Province. The system is cost-efficient uses smart technology and digital design to print 3D concrete blocks. A total of 44 hollowed-out 3D printed concrete blocks were used to lay the bridge while 68 concrete units made the handrails. The bridge has sensors that collect displacement data which will be used to improve the design of future bridges constructed using 3D printing."
