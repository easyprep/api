  "explanation": "On the recommendation of the Election Commission of India (ECI), the Union Ministry of Law and Justice has recently amended the Conduct of Election Rules of 1961, which allows senior citizens and person with disabilities in the absentee voter list in a bid to increase voter turnout. The absentee voter refers to a vote cast by someone who is unable to go to the polling station. The poll officer will attest the absentee voter in the case of senior citizens and person with disability in the form 13A. Now, the disabled and people over 80 years of age can cast their vote through postal ballot. Before the amendment, voting through postal ballot is available to armed forces and those assigned poll duties."
