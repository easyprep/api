  "question": "A given signal's second harmonic is twice the given signal's __________ frequency...?",
  "option1": "Fourier",
  "option2": "Foundation",
  "option3": "Fundamental",
  "option4": "Field",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Fundamental",
  "explanation": "A given signal's second harmonic is twice the given signal's fundamental frequency. Harmonics are generated when there are non-linearities in an amplifier (there are always non-linearities). The worse the non-linearities, the more harmonics. A signal at 27.5 MHz (approximate frequency for US citizen's band) would have a second harmonic at 55.0 MHz (on US channel 2!). Can you see why there might be problems? A CB operator might do well to place a low-pass filter on his radio.",
