  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nGreen bonds are financial instruments used for promotion of projects that brings in climate and environment friendly solutions. They are also called climate bonds or climate awareness bonds. World Bank is a major issuer of such bonds. Eg: India’s Rampur Hydropower project is run by financing from WB’s green bond. Moody’s predict that in 2019, the issuance of green bonds will be more than 200 billion USD.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nAccording to WB’s green bonds impact report, maximum green bond issuance is to projects in field of renewable energy and energy efficiency (44% of bonds). This is followed by clean transportation, forest and ecological resources, agricultural use and land use, water, resilient infrastructure, solid water management, etc.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nIndian green bond market is dominated by bonds that are between the sizes of 100 and 500 million USD. About 56% of bonds falls under this category. Smaller sized bonds make up the next largest volume. Very few bonds are in the larger size. Asia’s largest green bond is in process by Greenko and GIC holdings. This is worth 950 million USD. GIC is an Indian player.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe green bond market in India has guidelines from SEBI. This was issued in 2016, making India the second country after China to issue guidelines for this field. It specified the categories for the project for recognition as ‘green bond’- eg: biodiversity conservation, climate change adaptation, renewable energy etc. SBI also issued disclosure norms for green bonds in 2017."
