  "option1": "Bhagat Singh",
  "option2": "Lakshmi bai",
  "option3": "Tantia Tope",
  "option4": "Nana Saheb",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Bhagat Singh",
  "explanation": "Bhagat Singh was an Indian socialist revolutionary whose two acts of dramatic violence against the British in India and execution at age 23 made him a folk hero of the Indian independence movement. He was born in 1907 so clearly he was not related to the 1857 mutiny."
