  "question": "Who of the following have won the Nobel Prize in Physics 2017?",
  "option1": "Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish",
  "option2": "John Kosterlitz and Duncan M. Haldane",
  "option3": "Takaaki Kajita, Barry Barish and Rainer Weiss",
  "option4": "David J. Wineland, John Kosterlitz and Rainer Weiss",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish",
  "explanation": "The 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics has been jointly awarded to three US scientists - Rainer Weiss, Kip S. Thorne and Barry C. Barish - for the detection of gravitational waves. The ripples were predicted by Albert Einstein and are a fundamental consequence of his General Theory of Relativity. The winners are members of the Ligo-Virgo observatories, which were responsible for the breakthrough. The winners join a prestigious list of 204 other Physics laureates recognised since 1901. The trio will share the prize sum of nine million kronor prize. Prof Weiss gets half of the prize money, while Barish and Thorne will share the other half. Gravitational waves describe the stretching and squeezing of space-time that occurs when massive objects accelerate."
