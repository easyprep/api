  "question": "Which of the following is true about wetland ecosystem?",
  "option1": "It is marked by eutrophication",
  "option2": "Eutrophication in wetland can lead to the harmful algal bloom",
  "option3": "Both",

  "answer": "Both",
  "explanation": "<p>Wetlands are the water laden area whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with static water or flowing water, fresh, brackish or salty water where the depth of water at low tide does not exceed 6 meter. Â Eutrophication is the enrichment of the wetland ecosystem by the addition of nutrients . Thus wetlands are marked by eutrophication. Generally there is regular nutrient recycling in wetlands. But in case of waste disposal there can be harmful algal bloom."
