  "explanation": "In Tamil Nadu, the 462nd annual Kandoori festival 2019 has started at nearby Nagore Dargah, a famous Muslim pilgrim centre in Nagore. The 14-day long festival began on 6th February after the holy flag was brought in a procession and hoisted. The Kandoori festival is held to commemorate the death anniversary of 16th century saint Hazrath Syed Shahul Hameed Quadir Wali, who migrated from his native Manickapur near Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh and lived in Nagore till his death. As per tradition, one of the five flags was brought from Singapore. The main event of the festival-\\'Sandanakoodu\\'(sandal pot) procession- will be held on February 15. The Dargah of Saint Hazrath Syed Shahul Hameed in Nagore is more than 500 years old. Saint Hazrath Syed Shahul Hameed came to Thanjavur on a pilgrimage during the 16th century AD when he cured the illness of the then King of Thanjavur Achuthappa Naicken. The King gifted the saint lands in Nagore where the latter lived for the rest of his life serving the people, irrespective of religion, caste or creed."
