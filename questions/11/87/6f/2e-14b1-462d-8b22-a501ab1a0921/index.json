  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "First statement is incorrect because during President&rsquo;s rule (Article 356), the executive power shifts from the council of ministers to the governor of the state. Once imposed, President&rsquo;s rule must be approved by Parliament within a period of two months. It can&rsquo;t last for more than six months unless its extension is approved by Parliament."
