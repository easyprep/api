  "question": "A boat goes 40 km upstream in 8 hours and 36 km downstream in 6 hours. The speed of the boat in still water is :",
  "option1": "5  km/hr",
  "option2": "5.5  km/hr",
  "option3": "6  km/hr",
  "option4": "6.5  km/hr",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "5.5  km/hr",
  "explanation": "Speed upstream $latex = \\\\frac{40}{8} = 5km/hr&s=1$\r\nSpeed downstream $latex = \\\\frac{36}{6} = 6 km/hr&s=1$\r\nâˆ´ Speed of boat in still water $latex = \\\\frac{1}{2}(5+6) = 5.5 km/hr&s=1$\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer."
