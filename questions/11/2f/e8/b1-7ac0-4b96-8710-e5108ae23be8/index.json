  "question": "Which of the following is / are features of most of developing countries of the world?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Most of them have highly skewed income distribution</li>\r\n<li>Most of them have very low ratio of Labour/ Capital</li>\r\n<li>Most of them have negative Balance of Payment</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "The first statement which says that in Developing Countries the income distribution is highly skewed is a correct statement. The second statement, which says that in Developing countries the ratio of Labour/ Capital is generally very low is incorrect. The ratio would be high, as these countries will have less capital and more labour. The third statement is almost irrelevant as one can not link the stage of development with the Balance of payments."
