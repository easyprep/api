  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "<p class=\\\"Explanation\\\">Coal tar is incorporated into some parking-lot seal coat products, used to protect and beautify the underlying pavement. It is used but not much commonly in road construction. What is commonly used in road construction is asphalt which is sticky, black and highly viscous liquid or semi-solid present in most crude petroleumâ€™s and in some natural deposits. Being flammable, coal tar is sometimes used for heating or to fire boilers. Coal tar is also used medicated shampoo, soap and ointment, as a treatment for dandruff and psoriasis, as well as being used to kill and repel head lice. Health concerns have been raised concerning human exposure to coal tar in products such as hair dyes since coal tar and many coal tar-derived compounds are known to be carcinogenic. This is mainly because of the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)."
