  "explanation": "The Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has approved the extension of benefits of Child Care Leave (CCL) to single male service personnel and certain relaxations of CCL provisions in case of women officers of defence forces. The decision is taken in line with a recent Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) order extending similar benefits of CCL to civilian employees. Presently, CCL is granted to women officers in defence forces. Recently, DoPT has made certain amendments for grant of CCL to civilian employees, whereby the CCL granted to woman employees till now has been extended to single male government servants also. Further, single male service personnel and women officers of defence forces will also be able to avail CCL in respect of child with 40% disability without any restriction of age limit of the child. The minimum period of CCL that can be availed at a time has been reduced to 5 days instead of 15."
