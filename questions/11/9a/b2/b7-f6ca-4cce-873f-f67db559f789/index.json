  "question": "Consider the following:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Wildlife Sanctuaries</li>\r\n<li>National Parks</li>\r\n<li>Wildlife Corridors</li>\r\n<li>Biospheres</li>\r\n<li>Environmentally Sensitive Area</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above are established as per the provisions of Wildlife Protection Act 1972?",
  "option1": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option2": "1, 2, 3 & 5",
  "option3": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option4": "1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The proposed amendment incorporates a scientific definition of wildlife corridors into the act. This is a very important step which will save such areas from the threat of mining. As of now, the wildlife corridors are not as legal entities in India as wildlife sanctuaries and national parks. This creates confusion and that is why the proposed amendment would make sure these corridors become a legal entity so that they are protected by law and there can be no scope for confusion."
