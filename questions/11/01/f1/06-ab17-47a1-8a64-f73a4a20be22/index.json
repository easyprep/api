  "question": "What is the India's rank in the Save the Children’s \"End of Childhood Index 2018\"?",
  "option1": "116th",
  "option2": "113th",
  "option3": "118th",
  "option4": "110th",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "113th",
  "explanation": "India has been ranked 113th among 175 countries in the \\\"End of Childhood Index 2018”, issued by global child rights group \\\"Save the Children\\\". The Index which is part of the report titled “The Many Faces of Exclusion” indicated that the child marriages in India have come down to 15.2% from 21.1% in 2017. It is significant to point that the child marriage data assessed does not include data on consensual unions. However, the Index shows that under five mortality rate (deaths per 1000 live births) was 43 which is a cause of concern. Also child stunting (children aged 0-59 months) was 38.4% and rated as high. The Index ranked countries with regards to where childhood is threatened as a result of poor health, malnutrition, exclusion from education, child labour, child marriage, early pregnancy and extreme violence. Singapore and Slovenia are placed at the top sharing the first place in the index and Niger figures at the end of the list at 175."
