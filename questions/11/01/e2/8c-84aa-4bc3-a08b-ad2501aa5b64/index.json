  "explanation": "The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) has officially passed a resolution demanding the United Kingdom withdraw its administration of the Chagos Islands. The resolution welcomed the February 25, 2019 advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the legal consequences of the separation of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965. It ruled that the UKâ€™s decolonisation of the Indian Ocean islands was unlawful. It must be noted that UK retained possession of the Chagos archipelago after Mauritius gained its independence in 1968.  The islands have since been used for defence purposes by the UK and the United States, which established a military base on the island of Diego Garcia. The entire Chagossian population was forcibly removed from the territory between 1967 and 1973, and prevented from returning. The Chagos Archipelago is a group of 7 atolls consists of more than 60 individual tropical islands in the Indian Ocean about 500 km south of the Maldives archipelago."
