  "question": "With reference to the nuclear fuels, how the Fissile material is different from the Fertile material?<br> 1. While Fissile material undergoes nuclear fission, Fertile material undergoes nuclear fusion<br> 2. While Fissile material can be directly used, Fertile material can not be used directly in nuclear reactors<br> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "The fissile material is the one which undergoes nuclear fission (splitting of atom) upon bombardment by slow/fast neutrons. The fissile materials used are Uranium 235, Plutonium239 and Uranium233. (India is the only country in the world to use U 233 fuel, used in Purnima &amp; Kamini Reactors. Fertile material is the one which by itself is not fissionable but will capture the neutron and will get converted to a fissile material. Examples are Uranium 238 becoming Plutonium 239. Thorium 232 becoming Uranium 233 etc."
