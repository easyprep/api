Over the years, four broad principles have evolved for determining whether an office attracts the constitutional disqualification. The joint committee of Parliament on office of profit in two of its latest reports has observed that the expression has not been defined in the Constitution, the Representation of the People Act, Parliament (Prevention of disqualification) Act or in any judgement delivered either by a high court or the Supreme Court. The Part I and Part II of the Schedule to the Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959 contain lists of bodies, the holder of which would result in disqualification for MPs and MLAs. <strong>Backward Classes</strong> Backward classes are not defined in constitution."
