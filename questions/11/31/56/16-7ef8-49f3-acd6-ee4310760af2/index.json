  "explanation": "Iceland houses the \"Borgarfjordur fjord\". Borgarfjordur is a fjord in the west of Iceland. Although the waters of Borgarfjordur appear calm, the fjord has significant undercurrents and shallows. The many flat islands lying in the fjord are for the most part uninhabited. The land around the fjord has been inhabited since the time of Icelandic settlement. Events in the Icelandic sagas such as that of Egill Skallagrimsson are situated here.",
