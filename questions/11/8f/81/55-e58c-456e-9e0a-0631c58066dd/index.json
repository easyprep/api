The day is also known as \\'Fete de la Musique\\' after a music festival that began in France in 1982. Several singers enthrall listeners by playing their instruments in public or recreational areas. On this day, the citizens of a city or country are allowed and urged to play music outside in their neighborhoods or in public spaces and parks. Free concerts are also organized, where musicians play for fun and not for payment."
