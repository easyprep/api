  "answer": "1 only",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe NMC bill, 2019, passed by the Lok Sabha allows the NMC to provide limited license to certain unregistered practitioners. These mid-level practitioners will be licensed to prescribe specific primary and preventive healthcare medicines. In other cases, such practitioners can prescribe only under the supervision of a registered medical practitioners. The IMA is calling for a strike as it fears that it would “legalize quackery”.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Indian Medical Association is a voluntary organisation at the national level for the doctors who practice the modern medical system. It was established in 1928. It is composed of physicians and also medical students. It is headquartered at Kolkata. It is the founder of the World Medical Association.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\n“The Protection of Medical Service Persons and Medical Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss of Property) Act, 2015” was a draft bill forwarded from the IMA to the government in view of rising cases of violence against medical practitioners. However, the centre is reluctant to act on it as “public order” and “police” are state subjects."
