  "question": "What is the approximate equatorial circumference of the earth?",
  "option1": "25008 km",
  "option2": "55695 km",
  "option3": "40700 km",
  "option4": "40075 km",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "40075 km",
  "explanation": "Using those measurements, the equatorial circumference of Earth is about 24,901 miles (40,075 km). However, from pole-to-pole â€” the meridional circumference of the Earth is only 24,860 miles (40,008 km) around. This shape, caused by the flattening at the poles, is called an oblate spheroid."
