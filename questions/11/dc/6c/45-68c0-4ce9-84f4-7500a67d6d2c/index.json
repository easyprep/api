The date of August 19 was chosen to commemorate  the invention of the Daguerreotype, a photographic process developed by Frenchmen Louis Daguerre & Joseph Nicephore Niepce in 1837. On 9th January 1839, the French Academy of Sciences announced the Daguerreotype process. After that, on 19th August 1839, the French government purchased the patent and announced the invention as a gift “free to the world”."
