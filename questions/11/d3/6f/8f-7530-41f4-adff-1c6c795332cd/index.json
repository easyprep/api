  "question": "Consider the following statements with reference to Global Fuel Economy Initiative (GEFI):\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It works to secure maximum deployment of vehicle efficiency technologies across the world</li>\r\n<li>It is an intergovernmental organisation working under the aegis of United Nations Environment Program (UNEP</li>\r\n<li>Its objective is to see total vehicle emissions 50% lower in 2050</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct. The Global Fuel Economy Initiative (GFEI) exists to assist governments and transport stakeholders promote greater fuel economy and to maximise deployment of vehicle efficiency technologies across the world. <br />Statement 2 is incorrect. GFEI is a partnership of the International Energy Agency (IEA), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), International Transport Forum of the OECD (ITF), International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), Institute for Transportation Studies at UC Davis, and the FIA Foundation. <br />Statement 3 is correct. GFEI primary metric is vehicle efficiency – with a target to cut vehicle fuel use (and CO2) per kilometer by 50% from today’s level, on average for all cars on the planet – by 2050. Our broader objective is to see total vehicle emissions 50% lower in 2050 than they would otherwise be if we don’t accelerate our efforts to improve vehicle fuel economy."
