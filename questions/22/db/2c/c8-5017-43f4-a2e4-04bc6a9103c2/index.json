Consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>The code will bring travelling allowances and bonuses given to employees under its purview.</li>\n<li>The bill addresses the issue of gender bias in wages.</li>\n<li>The floor wage will be equal to the minimum wage under this bill.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 and 3",
  "option2": "1 and 2",
  "option3": "2 only",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 only",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe code on wages bill, 2019 will consolidate 4 laws: the <em>Payment of Wages Act, 1936, the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965, and the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976. The ‘wage’ mentioned in the bill refers to salary or allowance in monetary form. It doesn’t cover bonuses and travelling expenses.</em>\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe wages are to be paid depending upon the skill, experience, responsibility and the effort required for the work. The gender of the employee will not be considered while determining the wages for a job. In case of employment too, gender discrimination is prohibited by the bill.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe central government is to set the “floor wage” according to the code. This limit will be set after consultation with the Central Advisory Body and the state governments; and will be based on factors like geographical area. The minimum wages (set by the state governments) must be higher than the floor wage. In case the prevailing minimum wage is higher than the floor wage, the government must not reduce it."
