  "question": "In October, Gandhinagar was declared the first kerosene free district in Gujarat. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is a consequence of the Ujjwala Scheme’s implementation.</li>\n<li>Kerosene is used in jet fuels.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Gandhinagar district received 1,000 LPG connection through the Ujjwala Yojana. As a result, the district’s dependence on kerosene has plummeted. 75,000 women beneficiaries were covered under the scheme. The implementation was aided by the ONGC at the cost of 6.13 crore INR.\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nKerosene is a major component of jet fuel. Hence this affects the availability of this fuel for domestic purposes. Apart from this, the fuel possesses high risk of accidental poisoning, especially among children. Though not extremely harmful, kerosene can cause damage to the skin and lower level damage to the lungs.\n&nbsp;"
