  "question": "Which of the following is highly compressible?",
  "option1": "Solid",
  "option2": "Liquid",
  "option3": "Gas",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Gas",
  "explanation": "Gases show high compressible because the molecules of gases are very very loosely packed and there is too much space between them so by compressing it is comes close and close and close and as its intermolecular space is more than solid and liquid it can be more compressed compared to the both."
