  "option1": "Earth",
  "option2": "Moon",
  "option3": "Sun",
  "option4": "Mars",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Sun",
  "explanation": "The GOLF (Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies) experiment on the SOHO mission aims to study the internal structure of the sun by measuring the spectrum of global oscillations in the frequency range 10?7 to 6 10?3 Hz. The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, SOHO, is the most comprehensive space mission ever devoted to the study of the Sun and its nearby cosmic environment known as the heliosphere. Recently, a team of researchers have discovered solar seismic waves which revealed that Sun’s core is rotating four times faster than its surface. Earlier it w... it was assumed that sun’s core rotate at same speed as the surface. The discovery was made using 16 years of observations from GOLF (Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies) instrument on Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft, a joint project of ESA and NASA."
