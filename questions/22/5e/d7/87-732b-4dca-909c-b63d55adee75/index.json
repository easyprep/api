  "question": "With reference to the recent discussions on the threats to India’s Shola forest, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>These tropical montane forests are found in valleys.</li>\n<li>The Nilgiri region has Shola forests.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Shola vegetation is a tropical montane type of vegetation. It is found mainly in valleys. It is characterised by stunted trees (25-30 feet) in patches that are separated by rolling grasslands. They are known for holding water reserves and rich biodiversity.\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nNilgiri biosphere reserve has Shola forests. These are home to some important species, including the endemic Nilgiri Thar and Nilgiri Pipit. These lands face threat from plantation crops, invasive flora, forest fires, expanding human activity (especially tourism), land fragmentation, etc."
