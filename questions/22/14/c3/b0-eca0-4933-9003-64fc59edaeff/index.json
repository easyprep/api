  "question": "Consider the following differences between Grazing food chain and Detritus food chain: <ol> <li>While grazing food chain begins with green grasses at first tropic level, detritus food chain begins with dead decay of organic matter</li> <li>While grazing food chain adds energy to the ecosystem, detritus food chain consumes energy from ecosystem</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
