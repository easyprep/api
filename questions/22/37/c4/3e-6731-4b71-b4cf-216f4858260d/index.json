  "option3": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option4": "None",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 & 2 Only",
  "explanation": "Quantitative easingÂ is an unconventional monetary policy in which a central bank purchases government securities or other securities from the market in order to lower interest rates and increase the money supply. Reverse Repo rateÂ is the short term borrowingÂ rateÂ at which RBI borrows money from banks.Â Decrease in reverse repo rate makes the commercial banks to keep fewer amounts with RBI and increase their lending capacity and hence increases the liquidity in the market. Increase in SLR decreases the lending capacity of the banks and hence decreases the liquidity in the market."
