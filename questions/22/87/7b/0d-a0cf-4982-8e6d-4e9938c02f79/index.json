  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The Rome Statute established four core international crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. Those crimes \\\"shall not be subject to any statute of limitations\\\". Under the Rome Statute, the ICC can only investigate and prosecute the four core international crimes in situations where states are \\\"unable\\\" or \\\"unwilling\\\" to do so themselves; the jurisdiction of the court is complimentary to jurisdictions of domestic courts. As of October 2017, 123 states are party to the statute. India has neither signed nor ratified the Rome Statute on the International Criminal Court."
