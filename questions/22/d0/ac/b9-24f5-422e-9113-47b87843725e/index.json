  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nLead is one of the commonly used metals in 19<sup>th</sup> century architecture. It was used in the roofing material where the metal was used to cover the wooden structures. It was also used in the gutters. The April fire caused the toxic metal to be released into the atmosphere.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nCurrently, WHO does not have any guidelines for dealing with outdoor lead dust hazards. The French government has guidelines for lead levels in buildings and indoor locations but none for lead accumulated in outdoor public places. The Notre Dame Cathedral is not expected to be safe for public entry atleast for another 3 years."
