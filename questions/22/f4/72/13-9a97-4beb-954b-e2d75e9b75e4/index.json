  "question": "Which among the following pairs of tectonic landforms is/are<strong> not</strong> correctly matched?<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Rift valley – Linear lowland created by a tectonic rift or fault</li>\n<li>Asymmetric valley – A valley that has steeper slopes on one side</li>\n<li>Mid-ocean ridge – Long and narrow depressions of the sea floor</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "Asymmetric valley - A valley that has steeper slopes on one side is called an asymmetrical valley. They are Azonal landforms. They are associated with tectonic activity.<br />Mid oceanic Ridge - The underwater mountain system formed by plate tectonic spreading is called the Mid oceanic ridge. They are formed by plate tectonics due to the process of sea floor spreading. They are formed at divergent plate boundaries. They are the longest mountain ranges of the world.<br />Rift Valley - Rift valley is a type of a tectonic landform. It is a linear lowland formed by a tectonic rift or fault. It is formed on a divergent plate boundary."
