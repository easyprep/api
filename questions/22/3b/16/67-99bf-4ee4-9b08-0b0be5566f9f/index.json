  "question": "What is the relationship between the magnetisation of a paramagnetic material and the absolute temperature?",
  "option1": "they are directly proportional to each other",
  "option2": "they are inversely proportional to each other",
  "option3": "they are independent of each other",
  "option4": "None",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "they are inversely proportional to each other",
  "explanation": "The magnetisation of a paramagnetic material is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature. This is known as Curieâ€™s law."
