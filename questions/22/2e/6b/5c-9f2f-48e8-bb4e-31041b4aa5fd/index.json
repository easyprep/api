  "question": "Which country started world's first 'negative emissions' power plant?",
  "option1": "Colombia",
  "option2": "Belgium",
  "option3": "Argentina",
  "option4": "Iceland",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Iceland",
  "explanation": "World's first 'negative emissions' power plant started operating in Iceland. It indicates that the power plant eliminates more carbon dioxide (CO2) than it produces. This feat has been accomplished by a climate-startup named Climeworks by refitting a geothermal plant in Iceland. In this power plant, Climeworks' patented air filter captures the carbon dioxide (CO2) from ambient air. Thereafter the low-grade heat from geothermal power plant heats up the filter which results in the extraction of pure CO2.",
