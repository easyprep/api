  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "<strong>Merit App</strong>\r\nMERIT app (Merit Order Despatch of Electricity for Rejuvenation of Income and Transparency) was launched for facilitating states to select Independent Power Producers (IPPs). The app displays extensive array of information regarding the merit order such as daily state-wise marginal variable costs of all generators, daily source-wise power purchases of respective states/UTs.\r\n<strong>Pencil Portal</strong>\r\nThe Ministry of Labour &amp; Employment launched the Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour (PENCIL) Portal which has components ensuring enforcement of the Act, mechanism for redressal of complaints, child tracking system and a monitoring mechanism.\r\n<strong>SAMEEP</strong>\r\nSAMEEP is an acronym for “Students and MEA Engagement Programme”. It is an initiative by Ministry of External Affairs. Its main objective is to take Indian Foreign Policy and its global engagements to students in smaller towns and cities. The programme will try to inculcate in students interest about India’s global ambitions and to consider diplomacy as a carrier option. For this, the ministry of external affairs has asked all its officers on leave to travel to their hometowns and particularly their alma mater. Their job would be to engage students in the schools and colleges in the jobs that the ministry is engaged in, so as to give them a fair idea of how India engages with the world, what are its foreign policy priorities and how diplomacy is actually conducted. The programme is voluntary and gives officials the option of going back to their alma mater or to any school or college in their hometown."
