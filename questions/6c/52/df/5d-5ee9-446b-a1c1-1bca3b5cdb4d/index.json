  "question": "With respect to Haryana’s success with its ‘7-star Rainbow Scheme’, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The scheme rates district administrations based on their performance under various parameters.</li>\n<li>The silver star is awarded for good governance.</li>\n<li>The golden star is awarded for social participation.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "All are incorrect",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are incorrect",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe scheme is targeted at the Gram Panchayats in Haryana. There are seven stars that are given to the GPs when they achieve the goals for it. The scheme has seen massive improvements as it also involves monetary awards- 1 lakh INR for each parameter achieved.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe silver star is awarded for social participation. The GPs have been recording steep improvement in performance- some villages have improved from a single starred to 6-star unit in a single year. The number of GPs with silver starts increased from 90 in 2018-19 to 103 in 2019-20.\n<strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe golden star is given to the GPs for good governance. The GPs have shown dramatic improvement in this parameter. In 2018-19, there were only 12 panchayats with golden star rating. In 2019-20, the number increased to 203. Other stars are pink, white, blue, green and orange.\n&nbsp;"
