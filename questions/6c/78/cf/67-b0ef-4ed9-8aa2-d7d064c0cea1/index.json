Mitochondrial Eve is the most recent woman from whom all humans originated. The male counterpart is the Y-chromosomal Adam.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nAfrica is the most widely accepted place of origin of Mitochondrial Eve. This is in accordance with the Out of Africa theory which suggests that humans originated in the African region. It is theorised that humans left Africa in several waves of dispersal."
