  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Brihaddeshi",
  "explanation": "Brihaddeshi is a Classical Sanskrit (dated ca. 6th to 8th century) text on Indian classical music, attributed to Matanga Muni. It is the first text that speaks directly of the raga and distinguishes the classical (marga) and the folk (desi). It also introduced sargam notation. In Matanga&#8217;s discussion of musical scales and micro-tonal intervals he clarifies Bharata Muni&#8217;s Natya Shastra on which the author based his work. It clarifies many issues related to shruti that were presented tersely by Bharata."
