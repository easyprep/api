  "explanation": "On 10 August 1928, much ahead of the release of the Simon Commission's report, Motilal Nehru and his group came out with their Nehru Report to establish that Indians could arrive at a consensus, and could write their own constitution. The report outlined a new dominion status constitution for India within the British Commonwealth, and provided for internal self-government. Most of the Muslim League leaders, including Jinnah, rejected the proposals. The Nehru report stated that the `next immediate step for India must be dominion status. India would be a federation, a sovereign two-chamber parliament to which the ministry would be responsible will be having at the centre. In the annual Congress session at Calcutta in 1928, while most leaders were fine with the dominion status for the time being, some were in favour of complete swaraj. As a middle way, Gandhi proposed that a period of two years be given to Britain to concede to the proposals in the Nehru Report and the dominion status; and if those were not granted, the Congress would fight and settle only for complete independence."
