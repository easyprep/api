  "answer": "1908 Summer Olympic Games",
  "explanation": "In the 1908 Summer Olympic Games, football became an official competition. At the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, football became an official competition. Planned by The Football Association, England's football governing body, the event was for amateur players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition. Great Britain (represented by the England national amateur football team) won the gold medals. They repeated the feat at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm."
