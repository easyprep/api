  "option1": "France",
  "option2": "Netherlands",
  "option3": "Belgium",
  "option4": "Germany",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Germany",
  "explanation": "Germany's UNESCO World Heritage Site is \"Fagus Factory in Alfeld\". Designed in around 1910, the Fagus Factory in Alfeld constitutes an architectural complex which foreshadows the modernist movement in architecture. Built by Walter Gropius, it is notable for the innovative use of walls of vast glass panels combined with an attenuated load-bearing structure. It bears testimony to a major break with the existing architectural and decorative values of the period and represents a determined move towards a functionalist industrial aesthetic. The Fagus Factory in Alfeld establishes several major fundamental aspects of the modern functionalist architecture of the 20th century, in particular the curtain wall."
