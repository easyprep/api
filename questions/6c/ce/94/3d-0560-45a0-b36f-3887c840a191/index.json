  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "None of the above",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Santusht portal was launched by the ministry of labour and employment. It is to promote transparency, effective public service delivery, accountability and implementation of schemes under the ministry. It was constituted in January of 2020. It was recently discussed in the Lok Sabha.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Santusht portal is not for grievance redressal. It is the implementation monitoring cell of the ministry. It will monitor the grass-root level implementation of the labour laws in the country. This is in light of the governmentâ€™s target to implement all 4 codes on wages.\n<strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe CPGRAMS portal is the tool meant for grievance redressal. The Centralised Public Grievance Redressal and Monitoring System is a system developed by the National Informatics Centre. It will handle the same for the ministry of labour and employment too.\n&nbsp;"
