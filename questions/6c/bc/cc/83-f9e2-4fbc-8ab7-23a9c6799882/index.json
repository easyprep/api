  "question": "What is perfectly inelastic demand?",
  "option1": "Demand doesn’t change with price",
  "option2": "Demand change with price",
  "option3": "Change in demand is equal to price",
  "option4": "Demand changes infinitely",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Demand doesn’t change with price",
  "explanation": "Price elasticity = 0,  Perfectly inelastic-  Demand does not change as price changes<br />Price elasticity &lt; 1, less than unit elastic-  % change in demand is less than that in price <br />Price elasticity = 1, Unit elastic -  % change in demand is equal that in price<br />Price elasticity &gt; 1, more than unit elastic - % change in demand is more than that in price<br />Price elasticity = ∞ ,  Perfectly elastic Demand changes infinitely"
