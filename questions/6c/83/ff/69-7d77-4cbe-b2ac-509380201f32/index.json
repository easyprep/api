  "explanation": "Iran was the location of the event \"Persian Awakening or Persian Spring\". The Iranian Green Movement, also referred to as Persian Awakening or Persian Spring by the western media, refers to a political movement that arose after the 2009 Iranian presidential election, in which protesters demanded the removal of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad from office. Green was initially used as the symbol of Mir Hossein Mousavi's campaign, but after the election, it became the symbol of unity and hope for those asking for the annulment of what they regarded as a fraudulent election. Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi are recognized as political leaders of the Green Movement. Hossein-Ali Montazeri was also mentioned as the spiritual leader of the movement.",
