  "question": "If on a marked price, the difference of selling prices with a discount of 30% and two successive discounts of 20% and 10% is 72 Rs. then what would be the marked price (in rupees):",
  "option1": "2400 Rs.",
  "option2": "2500 Rs.",
  "option3": "3000 Rs.",
  "option4": "3600 Rs.",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "3600 Rs.",
  "explanation": "Let the marked price be x Rs.\r\n∴ SP $latex = \\\\frac{70x}{100}Rs. &s=1$\r\nSingle discount equivalent to successive discounts of 20% and 10%. \r\n$latex = \\\\left ( 20+10-\\\\frac{20\\\\times 10}{100} \\\\right )\\\\% = 28\\\\%&s=1$\r\n∴ SP $latex = \\\\frac{72x}{100}&s=1$\r\n$latex \\\\therefore \\\\frac{72x}{100} - \\\\frac{70x}{100} = 72&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{2x}{100} = 72&s=1$\r\n$latex \\\\therefore x = \\\\frac{72\\\\times 100}{2} = 3600 Rs.&s=1$\r\nHence option [D] is correct answer."
