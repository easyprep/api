  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option3": "1, 2, 3 & 4",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "ICM is a system of crop production which conserves and enhances natural resources while producing food on an economically viable and sustainable foundation. It is based on a good understanding of the interactions between biology, environment and land management systems. ICM is particularly appropriate for small farmers because it aims to minimize dependence on purchased inputs and to make the fullest possible use of indigenous technical knowledge and land use practices. ICM aims to achieve several initiatives like low-cost maintenance of soil structure and fertility, improvement of soil fertility, cheap and sustainable plant protection, prevent build-up of pests, disease and weeds, prevent damage to soil, water, human, plant and animal health, avoid loss of biodiversity and damage to habitat and reduce production costs and environmental damage etc. It employs several measures to meet these goals like soil conservation techniques, agro forestry techniques, use of renewable resources and improvement ecological diversity etc."
