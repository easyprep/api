  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 2",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\n    The Sun Temple is found in Konark. It is dated at 13 century CE. It is found 30km from the Bharati Huda excavation site. It is suggested that the tradition of nature worship, especially of Sun, arose and evolved from this region. \n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe excavations turned up a Sun motif arranged in chocolate slipped pottery. This suggests the prevalence of sun worship in the settlement. The excavation also turned up carbonized grains, animal remains, bone tools, beads etc. The grains indicate an agricultural society as did the remains of rice and jute varieties’ remains. Animal husbandry is implied by the presence of domestic animal remains found here.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe settlement did not use red and black ware according to the archaeologists. The black and red ware culture (BRW) is associated with Indus valley civilisation. These BRW settlements have pottery fragments of characteristic red and black coloration. These sites are found in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, etc."
