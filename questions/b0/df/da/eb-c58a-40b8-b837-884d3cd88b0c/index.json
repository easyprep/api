  "question": "With reference to the energy efficiency, which among the following is correct statement explaining the &#8220;Embodied Energy&#8221; (EE)?",
  "option1": "Energy used in the maximum useful work possible",
  "option2": "All energy used in the construction process",
  "option3": "Total flow of energy through ecological systems",
  "option4": "None of the above is a correct definition",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All energy used in the construction process",
  "explanation": "<ch^><table width=\"100%\"> <tbody> <tr> <td width=\"100%\"><strong>Embodied Energy</strong> Appliances consume energy to operate, but materials used in the construction of buildings consume energy, too. Embodied energy, or EE, is the sum of all energy used in the construction processâ€”right from extraction of raw materials, manufacture of products to their transportation and incorporation in buildings. Lesser the extraction, processing and refining, lower is the EE, and greener the product. Cement, steel and bricks, the basic construction materials, are the major EE contributors. Their use can be reduced only to an extent. Materials like ceramic and vitrified tiles, which are highly energy intensive, can be easily replaced with energy-benign materials like stone.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table><ph^>"
