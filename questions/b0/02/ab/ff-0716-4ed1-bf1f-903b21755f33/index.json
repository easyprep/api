  "explanation": "The 16-year-old Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg and her “Fridays for Future” global movement has won a prestigious Amnesty International’s Ambassador of Conscience Award for 2019. She has been recognized for mobilizing world public opinion on the looming peril of global warming.  The Fridays for Future movement was started in August 2018 by Greta Thunberg, who decided to miss school every Friday and protest outside the Swedish parliament until it took more serious action to tackle climate change. Her efforts to raise awareness of the climate crisis quickly went global. Her strike inspired millions of students to skip school to join protests demanding faster action on climate change. The movement has now spread beyond Sweden to other European nations."
