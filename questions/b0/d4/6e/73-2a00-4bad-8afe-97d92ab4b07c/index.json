  "question": "Which among the following is / are responsible for colors in the fine cut diamond?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Presence of Impurities</li>\r\n<li>Variance in transparency of diamond</li>\r\n<li>Variance in index of refraction</li>\r\n<li>Existence of definite planer layers</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "Pure diamond should transmit visible light and appear as a clear colorless crystal. Colors in diamond originate from lattice defects and impurities. The diamond crystal lattice is exceptionally strong and only atoms of nitrogen, boron and hydrogen can be introduced into diamond during the growth at significant concentrations (up to atomic percents). Nitrogen gives yellowish color while the Boron gives bluish color."
