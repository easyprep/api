  "question": "386 million years old fossil of Archaeopteris was recently discovered in New York. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Archaeopteris is a flying reptile.</li>\n<li>They lived during the late Carboniferous period.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Archaeopteris was an ancient species of woody tree. They are one of the earliest examples of trees. The New York fossils were that of its root system. It was found at a quarry site in the Cairo region. Another species’ fossil (Cladoxylopsids) were also discovered at the site.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Archaeopteris lived during the Devonian period. They are reported to have contributed to the change in the atmospheric gases’ composition at the time. They are responsible for the atmosphere getting higher concentrations of oxygen thus stimulating other evolutions. The trees were extinct in late Carboniferous period."
