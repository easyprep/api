  "question": "In light of Indonesia’s 6.9 magnitude earthquake, consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>Indonesia lies on the ‘Ring of Fire’.</li>\n<li>The epicentre of the quake was in Sunda strait.</li>\n<li>India and Indonesia are participants of the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "2 only",
  "option2": "1 and 3",
  "option3": "3 only",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong> Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nRing of Fire is a stretched across the Pacific Ocean and characterised by high frequency seismic and volcanic activities. Indonesia lies in this region. The reason for the earthquakes in the region is the high level of tectonic plate activity. Indonesia has seen several major earthquakes and resulting tsunami in the recent past- especially the Lombok quake in 2018, 2004 tsunami etc.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe island nation is adjacent to the Sunda trench or the Java trench. This is formed by the Sunda plate- a minor tectonic plate. This plate has famously been the origin of the disastrous 2004 quake and tsunami. It has also been the site of explorations and manned descents.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nAfter the 2004 disaster, the need for an international warning system was identified. For this reason, the IOTWS was conceptualised at the UN conference in Kobe, Japan. It was activated under UNESCO in 2006. It has 25 seismographic stations, 26 national tsunami centres and 6 deep ocean assessment and reporting of tsunami/ DART buoys under its employ. India and Indonesia are integral parts of the IOTWS.  \n&nbsp;"
