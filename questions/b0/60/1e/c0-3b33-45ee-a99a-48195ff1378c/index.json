  "option5": "",
  "answer": "The mid-latitude regions experiencing the convergence of warm tropical and cold polar air masses",
  "explanation": "Frontal precipitation occurs when a front or boundary line is formed between two air masses of contrasting temperature. Along the fronts, the warm air rises above the denser cold air. The mid-latitude regions experiencing the convergence of warm tropical and cold polar air masses are important areas receiving frontal precipitation."
