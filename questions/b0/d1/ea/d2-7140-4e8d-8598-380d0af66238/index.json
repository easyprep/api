  "question": "Which country houses the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Volklingen Ironworks\"?",
  "option1": "France",
  "option2": "Russia",
  "option3": "Germany",
  "option4": "Poland",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Germany",
  "explanation": "Germany houses the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Volklingen Ironworks\". The Volklingen Ironworks in western Germany, close to the border with France, is a unique monument to pig-iron production in Western Europe. No other historic blast-furnace complex has survived that demonstrates the entire process of pig-iron production in the same way, with the same degree of authenticity and completeness, and is underlined by such a series of technological milestones in innovative engineering. The Volklingen monument illustrates the industrial history of the 19th century in general and also the transnational Saar-Lorraine-Luxembourg industrial region in the heart of Europe in particular. The Ironworks is a synonym for and a symbol of human achievement during the First and Second Industrial Revolutions in the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries."
