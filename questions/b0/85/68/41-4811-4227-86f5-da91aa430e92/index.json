  "option5": "",
  "answer": "10 days",
  "explanation": "According to question, \r\nA and B can do a work in 12 days\r\n∴ (A + B)\\'s one day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{12}&s=1$\r\nSimilarly, (B + C)\\'s one day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{15}&s=1$\r\nand (C + A)\\'s one day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{20}&s=1$\r\nOn adding all three, \r\n∴ 2 (A + B + C)\\'s one day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{12}+ \\\\frac{1}{15}+ \\\\frac{1}{20}&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{10+8+6}{120} = \\\\frac{1}{5}&s=1$\r\nand (A + B + C)\\'s one day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{10}&s=1$\r\n∴ A, B and C together can complete the work in 10 days."
