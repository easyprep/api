  "question": "Which of the following justify the reason that there is no Taiga biome on Southern hemisphere?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>There isn’t enough land mass in the southern hemisphere</li>\r\n<li>The climate in Southern hemisphere does not support coniferous plants</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nChoose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "In the southern hemisphere, there are also found coniferous but most of them are in warmer climates. The second statement given is incorrect. In the northern hemisphere, Taiga biome is found in between 45° to 70° latitude, whereas the same latitude in southern hemisphere is covered with water and hence, no Taiga biome is there in southern hemisphere."
