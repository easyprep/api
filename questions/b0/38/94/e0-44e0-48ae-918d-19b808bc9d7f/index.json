  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 and 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 Only",
  "explanation": "First statement is INCORRECT because Lingayatism is native to Karnataka and not to Andhra Pradesh state. It differs from Advaita, Dvaita and Visistadvaita of Vedanta. The Philosophy of this religion is known as Saktivisistadvaita, where god is conceived to be qualified by shakti or cosmic energy. Yoga and Meditation are the paths to achieve the cosmic energy. Lingayats do not eat meat, or smoke or drink alcohol."
