  "question": "<p>What kind of fertilizer is Urea?</p>",
  "option1": "Sodium fertilizer",
  "option2": "Phosphatic fertilizer",
  "option3": "Nitrogenous fertilizer",
  "option4": "Potassium fertilizer",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Nitrogenous fertilizer",
  "explanation": "<p>Fertilizers provide three primary nutrients: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K). Nitrogen supports vegetative growth. Phosphorus improves roots and flowering. Potassium strengthens resistance to environmental assaults, from extreme temperatures to pest attacks. Urea is the most important nitrogenous fertilizer in the market, with the highest Nitrogen content (about 46 per cent). It is a white crystalline organic chemical compound. Urea is neutral in pH and can adapt to almost all kinds of soils. It is a waste product formed naturally by metabolizing protein in humans as well as other mammals, amphibians and some fish. Urea is widely used in the agricultural sector both as a fertilizer and animal feed additive. More than 90% of world production of urea is destined for use as a nitrogen-release fertilizer. Urea has the highest nitrogen content of all solid nitrogenous fertilizers in common use.</p>"
