A 40-second video “GST - An initiative to create a unified national market” featuring him has already been shot and is being circulated by the Finance Ministry.  In the video, Bachchan explains GST as a unifying force just like the three colours in the national flag.  The GST will simplify a web of taxes, regulations and border levies by subsuming an array of central and state levies including excise duty, service tax and VAT."
