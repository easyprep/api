  "explanation": "The above three are GI protected farm products of India. <strong>Palakkadan Matta</strong> The Palakkadan Matta is an indigenous variety of rice grown in Palakkad district of Kerala. It is described as a bold rice with distinct flavour. <strong>Kalanamak Rice</strong> Kalanamak, a non basmati scented rice variety grown primarily in the tarai region of Uttar Pradesh, is so named because its husk is black. The variety has raised much hope amongst Indian farmers and rice-exporters due to traits superior even to the most preferred basmati. <strong>Fazli Mango </strong> Fazli Mango is predominantly grown in Malda and neighboring districts of West Bengal."
