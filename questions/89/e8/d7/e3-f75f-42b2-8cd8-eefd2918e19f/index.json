  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Soils which are formed in areas where mountains end and plains starts are called “Duars”. Duars are strips of gravelly Bhabhar and Tarai lands in between West Bengal and Assam. Duars are known for tea cultivation. Large numbers of seasonal hill torrents which leave the Siwalik Range and enter the level plain are swollen with water soon after heavy showers in the neighbouring hills and carry with them a heavy load of coarse sand and silt. They are called ‘Chos’ in the plain where their beds are broad, braided, shallow and sandy. They are quite numerous and in some places every kilometre has a ‘Chos’. It is mainly found in Punjab. Karewas valley is an intermountain valley fill, comprising of unconsolidated gravel and mud found in Jammu &amp; Kashmir."
