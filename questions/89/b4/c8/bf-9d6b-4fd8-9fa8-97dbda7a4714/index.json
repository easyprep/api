  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "The people had adopted the twin programme of ‘Boycott’ and ‘Swadeshi ‘ as parts of one and the same movement. These two words are two sides of the same coin and both were used as economic as well as political tools. Boycott referred to the boycott of British goods in order to register protest with the British public against the grave injustice inflicted upon Bengal. Boycott was a seemingly negative programme and Swadeshi as its positive corollary was accepted along with. Swadeshi meant use of, and encouragement to, native products as against foreign goods. Thus, the Boycott and Swadeshi movement brought all classes of Indian society, particularly in Bengal to a common platform for a national cause.<br /><strong>(Excerpt source: Gandhi and Indian Freedom Struggle By Mazhar Kibriya, APH Publishing Corporation)</strong><br /><strong> Note: Third statement is fabricated by me, it is far away from truth.</strong>"
