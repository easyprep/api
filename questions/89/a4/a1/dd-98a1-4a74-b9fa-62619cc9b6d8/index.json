  "question": "What is the general trend for first ionisation enthalpy in a group of the periodic table as we move from top to bottom?",
  "option1": "It increases",
  "option2": "it decreases",
  "option3": "It is constant",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "it decreases",
  "explanation": "The first ionization enthalpy generally increases as we go across a period and decreases as we descend in a group. ionization enthalpy represents the energy required to remove an electron from an isolated gaseous atom (X) in its ground state."
