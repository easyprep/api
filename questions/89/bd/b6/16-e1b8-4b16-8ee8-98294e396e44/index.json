  "answer": "Fiji",
  "explanation": "In 1789 the English Royal Navy Cutter the Bounty commanded by Lieutenant William Bligh was overtaken by 18 crew led by Master's Mate Fletcher Christian in what has been named the \"Mutiny on the Bounty.\" The area known as the Bligh Water is the body of water in the western Fiji islands through which Bligh sailed his 7 m launch during his 3,618-mile journey from Tofua to the Dutch port of Timor. At the time some of the local Fijian tribes were considered hostile and many were cannibalistic so Bligh did not wish to jeopardize his safety or the safety of his crew elected not to stop his journey in the area."
