  "answer": "Maya culture",
  "explanation": "Nakbe is one of the largest early Maya archaeological sites. Nakbe is located in the Mirador Basin, in the Peten region of Guatemala, south of the largest Maya city of El Mirador. Excavations at Nakbe suggest that habitation began at the site during the Early Formative period (c. 1400 BC) and continued to be a large site until its collapse during the Terminal Formative period (100â€“200 CE). The fall of Nakbe and El Mirador took place at roughly the same time.",
