  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe FSSAI released the draft in early October for receiving inputs. The draft proposes the setting up of labs across India in a public- private partnership model. These labs are to be accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe draft regulation from FSSAI proposes that the members be allowed to voluntarily declare conflicts of interest. They can also recuse themselves before FSSAI meetings. The format of these declarations are still unclear. Also the draft doesnâ€™t clarify on the creation of an isolated grievance resolution mechanism."
