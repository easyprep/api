  "question": "Consider the following statements:<br> 1. Most Deccan plateau rivers flow from west to east<br> 2. The altitude of Deccan Plateau is more in south in comparison to north<br> Which among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "In the south, the plateau is mostly over 1,000 metres above sea level. In the north it is mostly about 500 m above sea level. The Deccan Plateau is higher in the west and slopes gently eastwards. This would imply that most Deccan plateau rivers flow from west to east. The rivers flowing through the Deccan plateau have cut deep valleys and divided the plateau into several smaller plateus such as the Maharashtra Plateau, Andhra Plateau and Karnataka Plateau. The plateau is very big and there are many habitats: different Ecosystems with different sorts of vegetation, climate, geology and animals. The forests on the plateau are older than the Himalayan mountains. The Western Ghats mountain range is tall and blocks the moisture from the southwest monsoon from reaching the Deccan Plateau, this is the reason that the Deccan Plateau region receives very little rainfall. The Godavari River and its tributaries, including the Indravati River, drain most of the northern portion of the plateau, rising in the Western Ghats and flowing east towards the Bay of Bengal. The Tungabhadra River, Krishna River and its tributaries, including the Bhima River, which also run from west to east, drain the central portion of the plateau."
