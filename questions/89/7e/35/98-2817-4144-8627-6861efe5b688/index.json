  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is correct.</u> Gramin Agriculture Markets are village level markets. These are modified versions of existing 22000 rural-haats in the country. <u>Second statement is correct</u>. These aim to help marginal and small farmers to sell their produce in the market. Small and marginal farmers are generally not always in a position to directly transact at APMCs and other wholesale markets. So, the government decided to provide them with separate platform. The physical infrastructure in GrAMs, will be strengthened using MGNREGA and other Government Schemes and would be electronically linked to e-NAM and exempted from regulations of APMCs."
