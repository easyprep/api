  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 1",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "none",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "El Nino is characterised with warm sea surface temperature in the eastern pacific ocean will leads to draught condition in south east India and disturbs monsoon in India.<br />Many types of coral have a special symbiotic relationship with a tiny marine algae (zooxanthellae) that live inside corals’ tissue and are very efficient food producers that provide up to 90 per cent of the energy corals require to grow and reproduce.Coral bleaching occurs when the relationship between the coral host and zooxanthellae, which give coral much of their colour, breaks down. Without the zooxanthellae, the tissue of the coral animal appears transparent and the coral’s bright white skeleton is revealed.When sea surface temperature increases and coral stress from other impacts may increase corals’ vulnerability to bleaching.Other stressors can also cause bleaching, including freshwater inundation (low salinity) and poor water quality from sediment or pollutant run-off.Hence as the climate changes, coral bleaching is predicted to become more frequent and severe.<br />Typhoons are land phenomenon nothing to do with El Nino."
