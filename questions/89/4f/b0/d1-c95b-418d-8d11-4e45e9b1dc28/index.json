  "answer": "2 Only",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u>. Long Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF) has been established to cater the major and medium irrigation projects under the PMKSY- AIBP. <u>Second statement is correct.</u> NABARD is responsible for credit disbursement under the LTIF. To make the loans from NABARD attractive for states, it was decided that the rate of interest to be kept around 6% by providing requisite cost free funds to NABARD every year during 2016-17 to 2019-20 on which interest cost would be borne by Govt. of India. LTIF will help a large number of major and medium irrigation projects under Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP), which were earlier languishing mainly due to inadequate provision of funds."
