  "question": "Recently, Indian scientists have started their research on “dark matter” in an underground laboratory. This laboratory is located at which of the following places?",
  "option1": "Bharat Gold Mine in the southern Karnataka",
  "option2": "Neyveli mines in Tamil Nadu",
  "option3": "Jaduguda mines in Jharkhand",
  "option4": "Sundergarh mines in Odisha",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Jaduguda mines in Jharkhand",
  "explanation": "The Indian scientists have finally started their research on “Dark Matter” in the special underground lab set up at Jaduguda mines in Jharkhand. The lab’s primary aim will be to join the hunt for dark matter, the mysterious stuff whose gravity holds galaxies together. The laboratory is located deep underground almost half-a-kilometre below the earth's surface. To search for dark matter, scientists need to dive deep underground, so their experiments are shielded from intruders like cosmic rays and other radiations. The rock overhead is expected to absorb these unwelcome rays that interfere with the experiments. The Jaduguda mines are located nearly 260 km from Kolkata and 150 km from state capital Ranchi. It was set up at a cost of a mere Rs. 20 lakh. This is India's second foray in underground lab experiments. Before this, in 1992, a similar facility was started in Karnataka's Kolar gold field but was shut down after the mine got flooded due to disuse."
