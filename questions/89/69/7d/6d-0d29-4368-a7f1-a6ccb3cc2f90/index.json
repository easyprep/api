The aim of the NDD is to reach every child, regardless of their socio-economic circumstance. It is the world’s largest deworming programme that covers 340 million children under-19 years of age across 36 states/ UTs.  The deworming programme is India’s commitment to a comprehensive national response to the public health threat posed by worms."
