  "answer": "1,2,3",
  "explanation": "In 1766 the British, the Marathas, and the Nizam of Hyderabad entered into a triple alliance against Haider. However, Haider soon bought off the Marathas. The Nizam abandoned the war in 1768, leaving the British to face Haider Ali alone. The latter attacked Arcot and reached the outskirts of Madras. He dictated peace on the basis of the status quo. The English also agreed to help Haider Ali against any third party invasion in future."
