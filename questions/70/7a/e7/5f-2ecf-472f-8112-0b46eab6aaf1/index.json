  "option1": "France",
  "option2": "Germany",
  "option3": "Ireland",
  "option4": "Russia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Germany",
  "explanation": "Germany's UNESCO World Heritage Site is \"Carolingian Westwork and Civitas Corvey\". It is surrounded by a still largely preserved rural setting and revealed from a distance by the pointed roofs and the bare-stone towers of the westwork, the Carolingian Westwork and the Civitas Corvey lie along the western side of the river Weser in the east of the town of Hoxter, in North Rhine-Westphalia, close to the border of Lower Saxony. The Westwork of Corvey in Hoxter on the River Weser is one of the few Carolingian structures of which the main parts have been preserved, and the only example of a westwork building from that time still standing. It combines innovation and references to ancient models at a high level. As a building type, it has considerably influenced western ecclesiastical Romanesque and Gothic architecture. Corvey was one of the most influential monasteries of the Frankish Empire."
