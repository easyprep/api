  "question": "In context of the recent discussions about ‘ethical veganism’, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It is also known as ethical vegetarianism.</li>\r\n<li>Ethical veganism is opposed to the use of leather products.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nEthical veganism is not the same as ethical vegetarianism. Ethical vegetarianism is only opposed to the use of products made from animals, such as meat. Recently an UK court ruled that ethical veganism is a philosophical belief and that its protected by the Equality Act of 2010.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:        </strong>\r\nEthical veganism is opposed to the use of any product derived from animals (like meat) and also products made by animals (like milk and eggs). Hence ethical veganism is against the use of leather products too. While veganism is simply a lifestyle choice, ethical veganism adds a positive ethical valuation to that lifestyle.\r\n&nbsp;"
