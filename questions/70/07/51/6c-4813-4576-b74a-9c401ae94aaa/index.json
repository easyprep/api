  "question": "A 10 Kg block of Iron has which of the following twice in value in comparison to a 5 Kg block of Iron? <br>1. Inertia <br>2. Mass <br>3. Volume <br>Select the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The answer is yes to all options. A 10 kg block of iron has twice as many iron atoms and therefore twice the inertia, mass, and weight. The blocks consist of the same material, so the 10 kg block also has twice the volume of 5Kg block."
