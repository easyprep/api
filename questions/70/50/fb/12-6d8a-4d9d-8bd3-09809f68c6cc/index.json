  "answer": "Egypt",
  "explanation": "Belly Dance, also known as the Arab Dance or Raqs Sharqi, is an expression oriented type of dance that originated in Egypt, which involves the complex movements of the trunk of the human body. As a social dance, belly dance (also called Raqs Baladi or Raqs Shaabi in this context) is performed at celebrations and social gatherings by ordinary people (male and female, young and old), in their ordinary clothes. In more conservative or traditional societies, these events may be gender-segregated, with separate parties where men and women dance separately."
