  "question": "In which of the following situations the Identical twins are born?",
  "option1": "Two sperms fertilise one ovum",
  "option2": "Two sperms fertilise two ovums simultaneously",
  "option3": "One sperm fertilises the ovum and zygote divides into two separate cells developing independently",
  "option4": "One sperm fertilises two ovums",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "One sperm fertilises the ovum and zygote divides into two separate cells developing independently",
  "explanation": "Identical twins form when one egg has been fertilised by one sperm and the zygote splits into two. This happens at the very earliest stage of development, when the zygote is no more than a cluster of a few cells.  If this egg then splits into two, an identical twin pregnancy can result."
