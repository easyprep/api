  "question": "With reference to supercritical fluid, consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Supercritical fluid is neither a solid, liquid, nor gases but rather a liquid–like gas</li>\r\n<li>Surface tension in supercritical fluid is comparatively higher</li>\r\n<li>Carbon dioxide and water are the most commonly used supercritical fluids</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "<p class=\\\"Explanation\\\">Only statements 1 &amp; 3 are correct. Supercritical fluid is neither a solid, liquid, nor gases but rather a liquid –like gas. There is no surface tension in a supercritical fluid, as there is no liquid/gas phase boundary. Carbon dioxide and water are the most commonly used supercritical fluids, being used for decaffeination and power generation, respectively."
