  "answer": "Georgia",
  "explanation": "Georgia's traditional musical instrument is \"Chuniri\". The chuniri is a bowed musical instrument of Georgia. Accompaniment of solo songs, national heroic poems and dance melodies were performed on it in Svaneti. Chuniri and Changi are often played together in an ensemble when performing polyphonic songs. More than one Chianuri at a time is not used. Chuniri is kept in a warm place. Often, especially on rainy days, it was warmed in the sun or near fireplace before using, in order to emit more harmonious sounds. Only the mountain inhabitants of Georgia preserve the bowed chuniri in its original form. This instrument is considered to be a national instrument of Svaneti and is thought to have spread in the other regions of Georgia from there."
