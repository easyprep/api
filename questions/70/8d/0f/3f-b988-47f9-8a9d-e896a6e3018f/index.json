  "question": "In context of the recent studies on ‘Super- Puff Planets’ class, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>They have very low densities.</li>\r\n<li>They are rich in gases.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nSuper Puff Planets is a class of exoplanets noted for their extremely low densities. They have densities in the range of 0.1 grams/ cubic cm- comparable to cotton candy. These were first discovered by Kepler Space Telescope of NASA.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nSuper Puff Planets are rich in gases. These are very young system compared to the solar system- around 500 million years old. Three known planets of this class are Kepler 51b, c and d. Their cloudiness is associated with the temperature of the planet."
