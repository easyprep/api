  "question": "In his initial attacks on India from northern frontiers, Mohammad Ghori chose which of the following passes?",
  "option1": "Khyber Pass",
  "option2": "Gomal Pass",
  "option3": "Hajigak Pass",
  "option4": "Bolan Pass",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Gomal Pass",
  "explanation": "One difference between invasions of Mohammad Ghori and Mahmud Ghazni was that while the former used Khyber Pass as the route for making entrance into India; the later chose Gomal Pass. This pass is located between Khyber Pass and Bolan Pass and connects Ghazni in Afghanistan with Tank and Dera Ismail Khan in Pakistan. Ghori chose it because according to him it was safer and shorter route. The primary reason to avoid Khyber Pass region was that it was still defended by Ghaznavi rulers and Ghori did not want a direct class with Ghaznavids at that time. The selection of this pass meant that the Multan and Uchh were the first to fall on his way and thus were won first. He entered through Khyber pass only after the crushing defeat from Mulraj-II / Bhima-II of Gujarat."
