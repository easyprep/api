  "explanation": "The Aravali range is the oldest mountain range in India. It runs across Rajasthan to Haryana. The Aravalli range is the eroded stub of a range of ancient folded mountains. Aravalli Range is one of the most popular mountain ranges in India also known as mewat hills. Aravalli, being the old fold mountains, have stopped growing higher due to the cessation of upward thrust caused by the stopping of movement of the tectonic plates in the Earth\\'s crust below them."
