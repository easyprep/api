  "question": "Which among the following has highest energy in the Electromagnetic spectrum?",
  "option1": "X rays",
  "option2": "Ultraviolet rays",
  "option3": "Micro waves",
  "option4": "Gamma rays",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Gamma rays",
  "explanation": "Gamma rays of Electromagnetic spectrum has highest energy.Â <br />Descending order of energies of different portions of the spectrum: Gamma rays &gt; X rays &gt; Ultraviolet rays &gt; Visible spectrum &gt; Infrared rays &gt; Micro waves &gt; Radio waves.<br />Extra info: Wavelengths of the above portions of the spectrum is inverse to the energies. eg: Gamma wave has shortest wavelength and radio waves have highest wavelength."
