  "question": "Which of the following is true regarding seismic waves?",
  "option1": "These travel through the solid parts of the earth only",
  "option2": "These travel through the solid as well as other parts of the earth",
  "option3": "These spread on the surface of the earth",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "These travel through the solid parts of the earth only",
  "explanation": "Seismic waves that vibrate perpendicular to the direction of their path depend upon a resistance to transverse or \\\"shear\\\" force which does not exist in a liquid or gas medium, so they can only travel in the solid parts of the Earth. P waves in air are simply sound waves and the speed of sound is around 340 m/s for ordinary temperatures."
