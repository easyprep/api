  "question": "&nbsp; &nbsp;Consider the following pairs: <ol> <li>Bergius process -  Hydrogenation of coal to produce liquid hydrocarbon</li> <li>Karrick process -  Low-temperature carbonization of coal</li> <li>Fischer&ndash;Tropsch process -  Converts a mixture of carbon dioxide and hydrogen into liquid hydrocarbons</li> </ol> &nbsp; Which of the above is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Fischer-Tropsch process converts a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen into liquid hydrocarbon. The Bergius process is a method of production of liquid hydrocarbons by hydrogenation of high-volatile bituminous coal at high temperatures and pressure. The Karrick process is related to low temperature coal&nbsp;carbonization. It could be used to distil out synthetic fuels-unconventional oil and syngas."
