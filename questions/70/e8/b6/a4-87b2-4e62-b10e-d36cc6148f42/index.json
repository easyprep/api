  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option3": "All 1, 2 & 3 are correct",
  "option4": "Only 2 & 3 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "The Ministry set up the Swaminathan Committee in 2004 to review the CRZ and the report was submitted in February 2005. The committee felt that the current practice of fixing CRZ based on high tide line is not the best of practices and is less scientific. It has also widened the scope of definition of a coastal zone. However, statement 3 is incorrect, because Vulnerability line had not been used in CRZ 2011."
