  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "Waking up to piracy threat to traditional Indian medicine, the Health Ministry has now finally fixed 1950 as the “cut-off year” for the purpose of including transcriptions of all Indian traditional works in the database of the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL). The step taken for the first time aims to safeguard the valuable traditional knowledge from being patented by other countries. This means that under the TKDL, which is a collaborative project between the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the AYUSH Department of the Union Health Ministry, all literature existing before 1950 in the public domain pertaining to Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha will be converted in digitized format in five international languages — English, French, German, Spanish and Japanese."
