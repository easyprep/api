The annual observance of the Day was proclaimed in 1992, by a United Nations General Assembly resolution. The 2018 theme â€˜Empowering persons with disabilities and ensuring inclusiveness and equality\\' focuses on empowering persons with disabilities for an inclusive, equitable and sustainable development as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  This year, the United Nations has launched the first-ever flagship report on disability and development \\\"UN Flagship Report on Disability and Development  2018 - Realizing the SDGs by, for and with persons with disabilities\\\". The Report provides an evidence base for disability-inclusive policy-making, implementation and monitoring and evaluation of an inclusive, accessible and sustainable global development agenda."
