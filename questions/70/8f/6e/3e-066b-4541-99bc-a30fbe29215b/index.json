  "question": "Which of the following are the necessary feature of a pollutant for biomagnification to occur?<br />1. Long-lived<br />2. Mobile<br />2. Insoluble in fats<br />3. Biologically active<br />Select the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "option3": "Only 1, 2 & 4",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1, 2 & 4",
  "explanation": "The necessary feature of a pollutant for biomagnification to occur are as follows: the pollutant should be long-lived, mobile, soluble in fats, biologically active. Short-lived pollutants will be broken down before they become dangerous. Immobility ensures that it will stay in one place and is unlikely to be taken up by organisms. If the pollutant is soluble in water, it will be excreted by the organism."
