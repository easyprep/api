  "question": "In context with the recent appointment of lieutenant governors to Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir, consider the following statements about the post:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Lieutenant governors enjoy the same rank as governors.</li>\n<li>All UTs have lieutenant governors.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nLieutenant governors do not hold the same rank as governors. While governors are the de jure heads of states, lieutenant governors head the union territories. The lieutenant governors have a lower rank than governors. However, in the case of the Lt. Governor of Delhi, the post holds more power than a state governor.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nNot all union territories have lieutenant governors. Initially, only Delhi, Puducherry and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands had lieutenant governors. With the appointment of Lt. Governors to J&amp;K and Ladakh, 5 UTs have the post. Other UTs have the post of an ‘administrator’."
