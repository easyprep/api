  "question": "Consider the following statements:<br> 1. Harbour waves originate due to earthquakes<br> 2. Rip tides indicate a nearby storm / hurricane<br> Which among the above is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Tsunamis are called &#8216;harbor wave&#8217;, and they are result of displacement of a large volume of a body of water, usually an ocean due to Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions. Rip tides are strong sea currents which push away from the shore as a strong storm is near. They are formed by the strong winds pushing water towards the shore. Tropical cyclones&#8217; winds push waves up against the shoreline even if they are hundreds of miles away, so rip tide warnings are often the first indication of a nearby hurricane."
