  "question": "The time in which 80000 Rs. Amounts to 92610 Rs. At 10% per annum compound interest, interest being compounded semi annually is :",
  "option1": "1.5 years",
  "option2": "2 years",
  "option3": "2.5 years",
  "option4": "3 years",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1.5 years",
  "explanation": "Time = t half year and R = 5% per half year\r\n$latex \\\\therefore A = P\\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{R}{100} \\\\right )^{T}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{92610}{80000} = \\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{5}{100} \\\\right )^{T} = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{21}{20} \\\\right )^{T}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{9261}{8000} = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{21}{20} \\\\right )^{3}= \\\\left ( \\\\frac{21}{20} \\\\right )^{T}&s=1$\r\nâˆ´ T = 3 half years or $latex 1\\\\frac{1}{2}&s=1$ years\r\nHence option [A] is correct answer."
