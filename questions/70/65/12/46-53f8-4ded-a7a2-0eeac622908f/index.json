  "explanation": "The Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), which had conceived and designed the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas, has set the ball rolling for building the next generation defense aircraft, the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), by extending an invitation to private players in Coimbatore to build a technology demonstrator. The proposal is not only the first time an indigenous military aircraft programme is seeing the involvement of private players, but it is also the first time a defense plane development project is proposed to be executed outside Bengaluru. The project to be implemented in Sulur in Coimbatore district which may house the permanent base of the Tejas squadron marks Tamil Nadu's first major defense aircraft project.",
