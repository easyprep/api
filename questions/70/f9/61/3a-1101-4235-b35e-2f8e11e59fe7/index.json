Then, Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah captured Calcutta on June 20, 1756 and took 146 English officers as prisoners and shut them in a small room. Many of them died due to suffocation. This incident was known as the Black Hole Tragedy and this story is narrated by J.H.Holwell. This incident was used by East India Company authority to win the support of British Public opinion and prepared a base for the war of aggression against Siraj-ud-Daulah."
