  "question": "In context with the recent discussions about Aerosol Optical Depth, consider the following statement:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is the measure of extinction of sun light by dust and haze.</li>\n<li>It is expressed in terms of candela per cubic metre.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nAerosol Optical Density/ AOD is a measure of extinction of sunlight by dust and haze. It is the blocking of solar beams from reaching the earthâ€™s surface due to scattering and absorption by atmospheric particles. It is used as an indicator of air pollution in a region.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nAerosol Optical Density is a dimensionless quantity i.e. it has no units. It simply gives the quantum of aerosol in a vertical column of atmosphere which is above the observed location. It value range from 0.01 (very clean air) to 0.4 (hazy)."
