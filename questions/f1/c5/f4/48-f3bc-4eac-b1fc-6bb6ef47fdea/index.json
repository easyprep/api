  "answer": "Nerve Cells of Spinal Cord",
  "explanation": "Acute poliomyelitis is disease of anterior horn motor neurons of the spinal cord and brain stem caused by poliovirus. The virus infects and kills motor neurons in the grey matter in the ventral horn of the spinal column. Due to this, muscles of the trunk and limbs are no longer able to receive signals from the CNS, so they become weak and begin to atrophy."
