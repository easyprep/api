Now, West Indies will progress to the 10-team ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier 2018, where they will be joined by the bottom three sides on the ICC ODI team rankings - Afghanistan, Zimbabwe and Ireland as well as the top four sides from the ICC World Cricket League Championship and the top two sides from the ICC World Cricket League Division 2.
