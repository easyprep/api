  "question": "Which among the following is the finest of all soil fractions?",
  "option1": "Gravel",
  "option2": "Clay",
  "option3": "Silt",
  "option4": "Sand",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Clay",
  "explanation": "The texture of the soil is determined by the proportion of the sand, silt and clay particles:<br />Clay: Particle Size – diameters less than 0.002 millimetre<br />Silt: Particle Size – diameters between 0.002 millimetres to 0.05 millimetres.<br />Sand: Particle Size – diameters between 0.05 and 2 millimetres.<br />Clay being the finest of all plays the most important role in soil chemistry. The proportions of each of these soil fractions determine soil texture and its properties.<br />"
