  "answer": "1, 2 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe World Bank brought in the terms Global South to refer to low and middle income countries and the Global North to refer to the richer countries. The WB report ‘What a Waste’ shows a positive correlation between the degree of industrialisation and development of a country to the amount of waste it generates. The trend shows a large flow of wastes from the more developed countries to the developing nations.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nBasel convention or the convention on Control of Trans-boundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal is an important part of international effort to regulate the global waste trade. Formed in 1989 following a series of high-profile cases involving dumping of toxic wastes in developing countries. About 180 countries are signatory to this convention.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nENFORCE/ Environmental Network for Optimizing Regulatory Compliance on Illegal Traffic is the body that enforces the Basel convention provisions. It deals with international cases of hazardous waste trade. Its members include one representative from each of the United Nations regions that are signatory to the Convention and five representatives from the Basel Convention regional and coordinating centres. INTERPOL members can be part of ENFORCE. Apart from them, members of United Nations Environmental Programme/ UNEP, NGOs like Basel Action Network/ BAN can also be members.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Bamako convention was signed by the African countries. It sought to impose a blanket ban on import of all kinds of toxic wastes that are generated outside the African region. The Cotonou Agreement was signed among the African, European, Caribbean and the pacific nations. It was signed when the Lome IV convention lapsed.\n&nbsp;"
