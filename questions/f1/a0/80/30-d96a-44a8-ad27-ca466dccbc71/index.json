The format for the student assessment will be offline and the question to Indian students will be related to India\\'s perspective only.  The PISA test will help reveal where they stand globally as far as learning outcomes are concerned.   PISA is a triennial international survey in which students are assessed in reading, mathematics, science and collaborative problem-solving. The purpose of the survey is to evaluate the education system worldwide by testing the skills and knowledge of 15-year-old students. The CBSE and NCERT will be part of the process and activities leading to the actual test."
