  "question": "In context with the recent observations about the ‘oxygen spikes’ in Martian atmosphere by the rover Curiosity, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Oxygen in the Martian atmosphere is produced by solar action.</li>\n<li>Methane is present in Martian atmosphere.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe oxygen in Mars’ atmosphere arises from the action of sun’s rays on the atmospheric gases and water vapour. The UV rays create molecular oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. Though these molecules are mostly unreactive, the recent observations show a seasonal variation in its concentration.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nMethane is present in the Martian atmosphere. It is known to spike and fall in concentration according to the Martian seasons. This variation, unlike that of oxygen, is more consistent. The methane concentration is higher in the Martian summer and spring but lower in the fall and winter."
