  "question": "A and B together can do a piece of work in 5 days and A alone can do it in 8 days, then B alone can do the same piece of work in :",
  "option1": "$latex 16\\tfrac{4}{5}days&s=1$",
  "option2": "$latex 13\\tfrac{1}{3}days&s=1$",
  "option3": "$latex 12\\tfrac{3}{5}days&s=1$",
  "option4": "$latex 11\\tfrac{1}{3}days&s=1$",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "$latex 13\\tfrac{1}{3}days&s=1$",
  "explanation": "(A + B)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex =\\\\frac{1}{5}&s=1$\r\nA\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex =\\\\frac{1}{8}&s=1$\r\n∴ B\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex =\\\\frac{1}{5}-\\\\frac{1}{8}=\\\\frac{8-5}{40}=\\\\frac{3}{40}&s=1$\r\n∴ B alone will complete the work in $latex \\\\frac{40}{3}=13\\\\tfrac{1}{3}\\\\ days&s=1$.\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer.<"
