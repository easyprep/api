  "question": "Which of the following States in India has no Legislative Council?",
  "option1": "Tamil Nadu",
  "option2": "Bihar",
  "option3": "West Bengal",
  "option4": "Maharashtra",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "West Bengal",
  "explanation": "Legislative Council or Vidhan Parishad is the upper house in bicameral legislatures in some states of India. It has no powers in terms of passing bills whether be it money or ordinary bills unlike Rajya Sabha which has equal powers as that of Lok Sabha in terms of Ordinary &amp; Amendment bills. Thatâ€™s why it is generally optional to have Vidhan Parishad.<br />While most states have unicameral legislature with only legislative assembly, currently, six states have legislative council - 1. Andhra Pradesh 2. Bihar 3. Karnataka 4. Maharashtra 5. Telangana 6. Uttar Pradesh."
