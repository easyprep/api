  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nHighest number of road accident fatalities occurred in Uttar Pradesh. However, the state ranked only 3<sup>rd</sup> when it comes to the number of road accidents. Tamil Nadu topped the list of states with highest road accidents. It is reported that UPâ€™s high incidence of road accident deaths is due to poor referral system.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe report showed that more men died in road accidents than women. The share of female deaths due to road accident stood at only 14% while the male share is 86%. Over speeding was reported as the major killer."
