  "question": "In context with the recent use of a ‘floating film transfer’ method by the scientists at IIT to prevent corrosion, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Squaraine was used to protect copper from corrosion.</li>\n<li>Squaraine is a mineral.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe scientists used squaraine film to protect the copper samples from corrosion. The use of a single layer reduced the corrosion by about 40%.  When 4 ultrathin layers of the compound was used, nearly 98% protection from corrosion was achieved.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nSquaraine is an organic compound. It consists of a hydrophobic end and a hydrophilic end that are connected together by a square unit in the middle. The hydrophobic end repels corrosive molecules away from the copper surface and protects it."
