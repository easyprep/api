  "question": "With reference to the recent filing of petitions against the CAA under article 32, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>A state government can move the court under this article.</li>\r\n<li>The Supreme Court has writ jurisdiction under this article.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nA state government cannot move the court under the article 32. This is because fundamental rights can be claimed only by people and citizens. The article provides for right to move the court in case of violation of the fundamental rights.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe Supreme Court has writ jurisdiction under article 32 of the constitution. Unlike the Kerala state government which made use of article 131, all other petitions against the CAA were filed under article 32. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in issuing writs."
