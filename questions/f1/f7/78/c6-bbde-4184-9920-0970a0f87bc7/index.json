  "answer": "Eliminating doping in sports",
  "explanation": "Blood doping is the practice of boosting the number of red blood cells in the bloodstream in order to enhance athletic performance. Because such blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the muscles, a higher concentration in the blood can improve an athleteâ€™s aerobic capacity (VO2 max) and endurance. There are two forms of blood doping. Autologous blood doping is the transfusion of one&#8217;s own blood, which has been stored, refrigerated or frozen, until needed. Homologous blood doping is the transfusion of blood that has been taken from another person with the same blood type. Although the use of blood transfusions for blood doping dates back several decades, experts say its recent resurgence is probably due to the introduction of efficient EPO detection methods. A test for homologous blood transfusions was implemented at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) says it is funding research into developing a test for autologous transfusions, and it is also leading the development of so-called &#8220;biological passports&#8221; which keep a record of an athlete&#8217;s blood and biological variables over time.
