  "question": "Consider the following statements made about the sedimentary rocks: <br />I. Sedimentary rocks are formed at Earthâ€™s surface by the hydrological system.<br />II. The formation of sedimentary rocks involves the weathering of pre-existing rocks.<br />III. Sedimentary rocks contain fossils.<br />IV. Sedimentary rocks typically occur in layers.<br />Which of these statements are correct?",
  "option1": "I and II",
  "option2": "I and IV",
  "option3": "II, III and IV",
  "option4": "I, II, III and IV",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "I, II, III and IV",
  "explanation": "Sedimentary rocks are types of rock that are formed by the accumulation or deposition of small particles and subsequent cementation of mineral or organic particles on the floor of oceans or other bodies of water at the Earth\\'s surface. Sedimentation is the collective name for processes that cause these particles to settle in place. The particles that form a sedimentary rock are called sediment, and may be composed of geological detritus (minerals) or biological detritus (organic matter). Before being deposited, the geological detritus was formed by weathering and erosion from the source area, and then transported to the place of deposition by water, wind, ice, mass movement or glaciers, which are called agents of denudation. Biological detritus was formed by bodies and parts (mainly shells) of dead aquatic organisms, as well as their fecal mass, suspended in water and slowly piling up on the floor of water bodies (marine snow). Sedimentation may also occur as dissolved minerals precipitate from water solution.<br />The sedimentary rock cover of the continents of the Earth\\'s crust is extensive (73% of the Earth\\'s current land surface), but the total contribution of sedimentary rocks is estimated to be only 8% of the total volume of the crust. Sedimentary rocks are only a thin veneer over a crust consisting mainly of igneous and metamorphic rocks. Sedimentary rocks are deposited in layers as strata, forming a structure called bedding. The study of sedimentary rocks and rock strata provides information about the subsurface that is useful for civil engineering, for example in the construction of roads, houses, tunnels, canals or other structures. Sedimentary rocks are also important sources of natural resources like coal, fossil fuels, drinking water or ores."
