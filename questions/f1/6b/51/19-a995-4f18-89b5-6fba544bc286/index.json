  "option3": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Only 2 & 3 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "The first statement is incorrect, if you look at the map of India and locate the wetlands, you can understand why it is incorrect. They are located in varied climates some are in arid zones like Rajasthan and some are in tropical zones. So we eliminate this statement. The second statement is correct and most of the wetlands in India are directly or indirectly related to the river systems. The third statement is incorrect, and almost all of you know that we have 25 Ramsar sites much more number of that is of all wetlands."
