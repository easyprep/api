  "answer": "The Gambia",
  "explanation": "Abuko National Park is an IUCN category IV (habitat/species management area) nature reserve located in the Gambia lying south of the town of Abuko. It is a popular tourist attraction and was the country's first designated wildlife reserve. The area was first accorded some measure of protection in 1916 when the Lamin Stream, which flows through the reserve, was fenced to form a water collection point. The enclosure of the stream saw an increase in the stock of wildlife and flora in the forest."
