  "answer": "John Austin",
  "explanation": "It was John Austin who brought the legal notion of sovereignty to its logical conclusion, therefore, he was regarded as the greatest exponent of the monistic theory of sovereignty. This theory of sovereignty was influenced by the then prevailing conditions in England and held that positive law expressed the will of the legal sovereign of the state and hence not bound by the dictates of natural law or any other superior law."
