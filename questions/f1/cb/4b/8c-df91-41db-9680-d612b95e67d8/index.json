  "question": "The total cost of 8 buckets and 5 mugs is 92 Rs. and the total cost of 5 buckets and 8 mugs is 77 Rs. Find the cost of 2 mugs and 3 buckets.",
  "option1": "30 Rs",
  "option2": "35 Rs",
  "option3": "38 Rs",
  "option4": "70 Rs",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "35 Rs",
  "explanation": "C.P. of 1 bucket = x\r\nC.P. of 1 mug = y\r\n∴ 8x + 5y = 92 …..(1)\r\n5x + 8y = 77 …..(2) \r\nBy using equation (1) $latex \\\\times $ 5 - equation (2) $latex \\\\times $ 8, \r\n40x + 25y - 40x - 64y = 460 - 616\r\n=> -39y = -156\r\n=> y = 4\r\nFrom equation (1), \r\n8x + 20 = 92\r\n=> 8x = 92 - 20 = 72\r\n=> x = 9\r\n∴ C.P. of 2 mugs and 3 buckets\r\n= 2 $latex \\\\times$ 4 + 3 $latex \\\\times$ 9\r\n= 8 + 27 = 35 Rs.\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer."
