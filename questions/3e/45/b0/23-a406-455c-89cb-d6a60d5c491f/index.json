  "question": "Which of the following is the limit beyond which stars suffer internal collapse?",
  "option1": "Chandrashekhar limit",
  "option2": "Eddington limit",
  "option3": "Hoyle limit",
  "option4": "Fowler limit",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Chandrashekhar limit",
  "explanation": "The Chandrasekhar limit is the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf star. The currently accepted value of the Chandrasekhar limit is about 1.4 M. White dwarfs resist gravitational collapse primarily through electron degeneracy pressure."
