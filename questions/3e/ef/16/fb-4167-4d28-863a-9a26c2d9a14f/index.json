  "answer": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "Assam was ruled by Ahom kingdom from 1228 to 1826 and it was sovereign even in the Mughal era. But in 1817, it was attacked by the Burmese and thus Ahom Kingdom went into the control of Burmese till 1826. The Assamese call this 7 year period as Manor din and the Manipuris call it Chai Taret Khuntakpa which means 7 years of devastation. The independent and powerful Ahom dynasty ended with the Burmese invasion. But, after the First Anglo Burmese War, the Burmese lost control over Assam in 1826 by Treaty of Yandabu."
