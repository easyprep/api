  "question": "Which of the following can be said as the “Theory of Darwin”?",
  "option1": "Survival of the fittest and struggle for existence",
  "option2": "Weak and strong always maintain a fixed proportion",
  "option3": "Different species do not arise by genetic mutation",
  "option4": "None of these",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Survival of the fittest and struggle for existence",
  "explanation": "Darwinism is a theory of biological evolution developed by the English naturalist Charles Darwin. All species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual\\'s ability to compete, survive, and reproduce.<br />Darwin’s evolutionary theory of natural selection gave a more rational explanation of the formation of new species. As per natural selection, various species originated from a single species as a result of adaptation to the changing environment.<br />Natural selection takes place in four different ways as follows:<br />• Variation – The changes accumulated over a period of time in an organism usually gives rise to a new species.<br />• Inheritance – It is the passing on of the variations over generations which ultimately lead to speciation.<br />• A high rate of growth of population – This gives rise to more number of organisms being reproduced by a species than the environment can support which might lead to the extinction of that particular species.<br />• Differential survival and reproduction – The superior variations lead to survival of a particular organism and the inferior or negative variation leads to extinction. The superior variations are the ones inherited during reproduction."
