  "answer": "AIIMS",
  "explanation": "All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) set up India's first Virtual Bronchoscopy Navigation (VBN), an advanced facility for diagnosis and treatment of small tumour-like spots in lungs. The VBN system was installed in the Department of Pulmonary Medicine and Sleep Disorders at AIIMS. Apart from India only few countries like China, Singapore besides the US and Europe own this facility. Using VBN system samples can be collected from small lung lesions with extreme precision and safety by using a bronchoscope. The machine uses the CT scan image of a patient to produce a 3D view of the windpipe. After that a bronchoscope can be passed through the windpipe to reach the abnormal areas. This will reduce the risk of puncturing the lung.",
