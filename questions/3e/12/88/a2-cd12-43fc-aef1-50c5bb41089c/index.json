  "question": "With reference to the recent efforts by USA to set up a specialised army unit to counter China, consider the following statements about the ‘Island Chain Strategy’:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The Island Chain Strategy was designed for use against the USA.</li>\r\n<li>The chains are composed of ‘unsinkable aircraft carriers’.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe Island Chain Strategy was designed by the US for use against erstwhile USSR. The strategy was latter adapted to counter Russia and China. It involves 3 ‘Island Chains’ to surround the target country by sea. Taiwan is an important component of this chain and hence is of strategic importance.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe Island Chain Strategy makes use of ‘unsinkable aircraft carriers’. These are islands that are used to extend the reach of a military force i.e, increase its power projection. Taiwan is one of the main ‘unsinkable aircraft carriers’ of the first island chain."
