  "answer": "All of the above mentioned factors contributed to the downfall of the Mughal Empire",
  "explanation": "The death of Aurangzeb in 1707 A.D. marked the end of the glory of the Mughal empire. The Mughal authority was challenged by several chiefs and Rajas at different places. The Marathas, the Rajputs and the Sikhs resisted the Mughal power simply to gain independence. The nobles took advantage of the weakness of the Empire by carving out independent kingdoms for themselves. The later Mughul monarchs were primarily responsible for the decay, disintegration and collapse of the Empire though, certainly, other factors also contributed towards it."
