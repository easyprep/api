  "answer": "Standard Definition",
  "explanation": "The companies in the digital industry have decide to temporarily offer SD (Standard Definition) content instead of HD (High Definition) and ultra-HD streaming. \r\nBy Standard Definition, the bitrates of the streaming will not be higher than 480p on cellular networks until 14th April. As a higher number of people are staying at home during the nation-wide lockdown, there is an extra-ordinary surge in the consumption of mobile internet. This step would ensure that the cellular network remains robust."
