  "question": "The work done in moving a body over a smooth inclined plane does not depend on which of the following?",
  "option1": "mass of the body",
  "option2": "height of the inclined plane",
  "option3": "slope of the inclined plane",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "slope of the inclined plane",
  "explanation": "The work done in moving a body over a smooth inclined plane does not depend on the slope of the inclined plane. W = mgh in case of smooth inclined plane, where m = mass of the body, g = acceleration due to gravity and h = height of the inclined plane."
