  "question": "The \"Mount Cameroon-Bioko Coastal Forests\" spans which countries?",
  "option1": "Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea",
  "option2": "Cameroon and Guinea",
  "option3": "Cameroon and Gabon",
  "option4": "Cameroon and Democratic Republic of Congo",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea",
  "explanation": "The Mount Cameroon and Bioko Montane Forests ecoregion comprise four areas of montane forest on volcanoes located in coastal Cameroon and the offshore island of Bioko. Mount Cameroon is the highest peak in sub-Saharan western and central Africa, with a vast dome that extends over 45 km and reaches just above 4,000 m in elevation. This ecoregion is unique in west Central Africa in containing a continuous altitudinal gradient from low-altitude (above 200 m on the western slopes) moist forest to subalpine vegetation at the highest elevations. While portions of this forest gradient persist intact, it is threatened at lower altitudes by subsistence and plantation agriculture. The ecoregion contains exceptional levels of species endemism and richness, in part due to the great altitudinal range and the resulting diversity of habitats. However, the forests of Bioko and Mt Cameroon are inadequately protected and threatened by conversion to agricultural lands, logging and hunting (bushmeat)."
