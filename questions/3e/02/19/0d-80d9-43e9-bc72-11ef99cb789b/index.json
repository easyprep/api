The day also highlights the importance of science in daily life and encourages youngsters to embrace it as a career option. On this day in 1998, India successfully tested   Shakti-I nuclear missile at the Indian Army\\'s Pokhran Test Range in Rajasthan. The tests were conducted under the leadership of Former President Dr A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, who was then DRDO Chief, and Dr R Chidambaran, then Chairman of Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). A team of more than 100 scientists, technicians and soldiers were involved in the successfully conducted tests."
