  "answer": "GAIL India",
  "explanation": "In New Delhi, Indian Railways has recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with GAIL India Ltd for use of environment-friendly fuel \\'Natural Gas\\'  in Railway workshops and production units. The purpose of the pact is to replace Industrial gases like Dissolved Acetylene, LPG, Bharat Metal Cutting Gas (BMCG) and Furnace Oil / High Speed Diesel (HSD) oil with Natural Gas. The use of natural gas has a potential to replace fuel worth Rs 70 crore per annum. This historic partnership will pave the way for supply of Natural Gas to Railway workshops, integral coach factories, loco workshops, DEMU sheds, etc. located along the existing and upcoming pipeline networks of GAIL. This endeavour shall reduce carbon foot-prints of IR and contribute positively towards achieving COP21 commitments."
