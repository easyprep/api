  "explanation": "The Kacchativu Dispute <br />A territorial dispute arose in regard to the ownership of a one square mile uninhabited island, called Kacchativu, off the Jaffna coast in the Palk straits. Pilgrims from both India and Sri Lanka used to go to Kacchativu Island every year in the month of March during the four-day St. Anthony’s festival for worship at the local Roman Catholic Church. <br />India protested over the presence of Sri Lankan police during the festival in 1968. This caused conflict. Both India and Sri Lanka were keen to avoid a serious situation. The Prime Ministers of India and Sri Lanka met twice and pending a final decision on the issue of island’s title, resolved to maintain status quo in and around the island.<br />Neither India nor Sri Lanka would send its policemen in uniform or custom officials, or resort to aerial reconnaissance or naval patrolling of adjacent waters during the St. Anthony’s festival. Finally, through a comprehensive agreement India accepted Sri Lanka’s ownership of the Kacchativu Island.\r\n&nbsp;"
