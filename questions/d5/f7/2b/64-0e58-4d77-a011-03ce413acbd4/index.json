  "answer": "Egypt",
  "explanation": "Egypt forms the mouth of the Nile River. Nile River is the major river of North Africa, which is also the longest river in Africa. The drainage basin of the Nile River forms eleven countries such as Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt. The river originates from two sources; one source is the White Nile river which arises either from Burundi or Rwanda and another source is Blue Nile river which arises from Lake Tana of Ethiopia. These two rivers join at Khartoum of Sudan to form the Nile River which then flows to Egypt to finally drains at the Mediterranean Sea in the Nile Delta of Egypt. Nile River is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan."
