  "answer": "Ecuador",
  "explanation": "Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve is located in Ecuador adjacent to Cotacachi Volcano. This nature reserve houses Andean and sub-tropical rainforests. The reserve is particularly important because it safeguards one of the few remaining examples of Ecuador's coastal rainforest, a much-threatened ecosystem which forms part of the Choco; an internationally recognised bio-region which extends from Southern Panama to northern Peru and has been rated as a global biodiversity hotspot. This nature reserve houses Cuicocha Lake, a volcanic crater lake."
