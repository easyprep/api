  "answer": "Bengaluru",
  "explanation": "ISRO Chief, K Sivan has recently laid the foundation stone for Space Situational Awareness Control Centre (SSACC)  at Peenya, Bengaluru. The aim of the control center is to monitor and protect high value space assets from space debris has been laid.  The control centre will boost activities forecast   for  Space Situational Awareness and Management (SSAM), which has now considered a globally essential area because of the ever-growing man created space detritus figure and the multiple collision threat with functional satellites and space vehicles. This step will secure Indiaâ€™s expensive and strategically important satellites and future spacecraft from space detritus such as dead satellite remains, parts of orbiting bodies, near-earth asteroids and extreme weather situations.  It would assimilate the tracking data of dead satellites from indigenous observation facilities produce important data from bare observations by inspection. It will also permit research activities to find solutions for space debris, space debris modelling and reduction."
