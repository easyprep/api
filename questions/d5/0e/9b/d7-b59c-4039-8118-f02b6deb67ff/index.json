  "question": "The apparent weight of the body becomes zero in which of the following cases in the elevator?",
  "option1": "during free fall of a body under gravity",
  "option2": "when elevator is accelerating downwards",
  "option3": "when elevator is at rest",
  "option4": "when elevator is accelerating upwards",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "during free fall of a body under gravity",
  "explanation": "The apparent weight of the body becomes zero in an elevator during free fall of a body under gravity. It can be said that the body becomes weightless as the force of reaction between the person and the plane with which he is in contact vanishes."
