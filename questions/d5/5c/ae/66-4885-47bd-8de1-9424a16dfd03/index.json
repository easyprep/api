  "explanation": "1. are made of protein and nucleic acids: This is a correct statement.<br />2. may contain either DNA or RNA or both: This is not correct. There can be either a DNA Virus or a RNA Virus but not having both.<br />3. possess enzymes necessary for the generation of energy.: This is incorrect. Viruses donâ€™t have necessary enzymes for generation of energy.<br />4. can be cultured only in living cells and not in a synthetic medium: This statement is incorrect because to culture virus in laboratory you need living media such as Bacteriophages."
