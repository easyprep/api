  "explanation": "In Dehradun, the Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP) has set up a plant which can turn plastic waste into diesel. The plant was recently inaugurated by the Union Science and Technology Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan.  The plant is not just a good step towards freedom from plastic but will also reduce Indiaâ€™s dependence on other countries for petroleum products. The plant will also boost economic growth as it will produce 800 litres of diesel from one tonne of plastic waste which will be collected with the help of NGOs."
