  "option1": "Socialist system",
  "option2": "Mixed system",
  "option3": "Market system",
  "option4": "Traditional system",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Market system",
  "explanation": "In the market system or the capitalist system, there is always a risk of overexploitation of workers for the profits of the companies. A profit is the main motive of this type of economy. It also may lead to the overproduction of goodsÂ since there are no regulations. This can also be attributed to the fact that the workers have low wages and hence cannot afford to consume all the products that are being manufactured."
