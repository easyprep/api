  "question": "With which of the following materials the tape of the tape-recorder is coated?",
  "option1": "Cooper sulphate",
  "option2": "Mica",
  "option3": "Ferromagnetic powder",
  "option4": "Zinc oxide",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Ferromagnetic powder",
  "explanation": "The tape itself is actually very simple. It consists of a thin plastic base material, and bonded to this base is a coating of ferric oxide powder. The oxide is normally mixed with a binder to attach it to the plastic, and it also includes some sort of dry lubricant to avoid wearing out the recorder."
