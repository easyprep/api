  "explanation": "This question is related to called Umbrella Revolution. Hong Kong was, prior to 1997, a UK territory and the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People&#8217;s Republic of China happened on 1 July 1997. The main law of the land is &#8220;Basic Law&#8221;, which is also known as Mini Constitution. The Basic law gives Hong Kong an impendent Judiciary, legislature and Executive. The Highest Court of Appeal is the &#8220;Court of Final Appeal&#8221; located in Hong Kong itself and thus statement 1 of this question is incorrect. The second statement is correct , because article 43 of the Basic Law says that &#8220;The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be the head of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and shall represent the Region. Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be accountable to the Central People&#8217;s Government and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in accordance with the provisions of this law&#8221;. Statement 3 is also incorrect because except in matters of Defense and Foreign Relations, Hong Kong is theoretically independent , however, there are numerous cases where China has actually violated the freedom."
