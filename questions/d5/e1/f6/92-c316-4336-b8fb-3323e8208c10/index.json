  "explanation": "The Autistic Pride Day (APD) is observed every year on 18th of June to recognise the importance of pride for autistics and understands it not as a disease but as a difference. Autism or Autism Spectrum Disability is a range of complex neurodevelopment disorders characterized by social impairments, communication difficulties, restrictive and repetitive pattern of behaviour. It is a lifelong condition which usually occurs in the first three years of life. The exact cause of autism is not known but it is known to be associated with genetic and environmental factors. Autistic Pride Day was initiated by Aspies For Freedom, a group that raises public awareness about autism rights."
