  "explanation": "The Government of India (GoI) has recently constituted a 5-member committee to review existing marketing structure in Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) marketing in India. The committee, headed by economist Kirit Parikh, will look into issues related to definition or quality standards of LPG being marketed. Its terms of reference also include scope for liberalizing government policies for private participation. The committee is expected to submit its report by end-July. Based on the LPG control order, domestic LPG should be supplied to oil-marketing companies (OMCs) only. The committee will also identify the grey areas that might allow private entities like Reliance Industries to sell subsidized cooking gas."
