  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nWorld Hepatitis day is held by WHO annually on the 28<sup>th</sup> of July. The theme for 2019 Hepatitis day is “Investing in Eliminating Hepatitis”. The host country is Pakistan for 2019. It is one of the 8 global public health campaigns of WHO.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nHepatitis is a viral disease and its types are A, B, C, D and E. Hepatitis E is the most common in South-East Asia. It is spread through contaminated water. It is prevalent during the monsoons and also during flash flood situations. The first vaccine against hepatitis was approved by China.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nHepatitis is a preventable disease. Yet every year 6 lakh people die because of it. Vaccination is a preventive measure for the disease approved by WHO. Treatment is using anti-viral drugs. Hepatitis type D can develop in people with the B type. This is because the D type virus multiplies on the B-viruses’ surface. Hence vaccinating against the B type will prevent both."
