  "question": "Which of the following is / are correct statements about an Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA)?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It is notified by State Government under state legislations</li>\r\n<li>It is supposed to be entirely free from Human interference</li>\r\n<li>It is regulated with due consideration to local contexts</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "The concept of ‘Ecologically Sensitive Areas’ is very different from that a protected area like a national park which is supposed to be entirely free from human interference, though in reality many management interventions such as creation of water holes and tourism related activities do continue even in the national parks. ‘Ecologically Sensitive Areas’ are areas under human use, sometimes quite intense human use such as generation of thermal power and cultivation of chikoo in Dahanu taluka. Hence, ESAs are to be viewed as areas where human activities will continue, but be prudently regulated under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. ESAs are not at all meant to stop development in ways that would hurt local people, but to ensure that development is environment friendly and people oriented, as well as serve to preserve the ecological heritage on a long term basis. There are no set regulations, such as ban on all new industries, or on conversion of agricultural into  commercial land, that would prevail in every Ecologically Sensitive Area; instead, the regulations will be worked out with due respect to local context."
