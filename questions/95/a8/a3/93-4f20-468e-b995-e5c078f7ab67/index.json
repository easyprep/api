  "question": "Which country has decided to include Hindi  as the third official language in courts?",
  "option1": "Iran",
  "option2": "UAE",
  "option3": "Saudi Arabia",
  "option4": "Oman",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "UAE",
  "explanation": "The Abu Dhabi Judicial Department (ADJD) has decided to include Hindi as the third official language used in its courts, alongside Arabic and English, as part of a move designed to improve access to justice. The move will help the Hindi speakers to learn about litigation procedures, their rights and duties without a language barrier. It is  an estimated that 3.3 million Indian expats live in United Arab Emirates (UAE), and a large number of them are blue collared workers. Hence, this is an excellent step taken by Abu Dhabi that will certainly improve access to justice for India\\'s blue collar workers. It also fits perfectly into the wider agenda of UAE\\'s Year of Tolerance‚Äù."
