  "question": "With reference to the phase changes in matter, which of the following is / are correct statements?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>When a liquid freezes, it releases thermal energy into its immediate environment.</li>\r\n<li>When a solid melts, it releases thermal energy into its immediate environment.</li>\r\n<li>When a solid melts, its temperature increases</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "The first statement is correct. When a liquid freezes, it releases thermal energy into its immediate environment. But the second statement is incorrect, because <u>a solid must absorb thermal energy in order to melt.</u> Third statement is also incorrect because <u>while a substance undergoes a phase change, its temperature remains constant.</u> This implies that as a solid melts or as a liquid freezes, its temperature remains constant."
