  "question": "&nbsp; &nbsp;Consider the following: <ol> <li>Strip-cropping</li> <li>Contour bunding</li> <li>No-till farming</li> </ol> Which of the above is/are used for soil conservation?",
  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Contour bunding is the farming practices of plowing across a slope following its elevation contour lines. These contour lines across a slope create water blockage and thus prevents heavy water run-off; which is a major cause of soil erosion. The water break also allows more time for the water to settle into the soil. Strip cropping&nbsp;is a method of&nbsp;farming which involves cultivating on a field which has been divided into long, narrow strips with alternate crop rotation&nbsp;system. It is used when a slope is too steep or when there is no alternative method of preventing soil&nbsp;erosion. No till farming is a method of farming where soil is not disturbed through is a way of growing crops or pasture from year to year without disturbing the soil through&nbsp;tillage."
