Internet service providers and governments should treat all data on the internet equally<br> 2. Internet service providers should not be able to slow down some content or speed up others to maintain equal access<br> 3. There should be no discrimination between the different &#8216;packets&#8217; that an Internet service provider (ISP) carries<br> 4. The charges of internet access should be equal across the ISPs and nations<br> Select the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "option3": "Only 1, 3 & 4",
  "option4": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The definition of Net Neutrality is still under development. Basically, Net Neutrality is the principle that internet service providers and governments should treat all data on the internet equally, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment or mode of communication. Net neutrality is commonly described as the principle of ensuring that there is no discrimination between the different ‘packets’ that an Internet service provider (ISP) carries. That means that the traffic from NDTV should be treated equally by Reliance Infocomm as the traffic from Network 18’s CNNIBN; that even if Facebook wants to pay Airtel to deliver Whatsapp’s packets faster than Viber’s, Airtel may not do so; that peer-to-peer traffic is not throttled; that Facebook will not be able to pay Airtel to keep its subscribers bound within its walled gardens; and also that Airtel can’t claim to be providing Internet access while restricting that to only Facebook or Whatsapp."
