  "question": "Which of the following statements regarding vectors is NOT correct?",
  "option1": "A unit vector is dimensionless",
  "option2": "A vector cannot be divided by a vector",
  "option3": "A vector changes, when it is displaced to itself",
  "option4": "Current is not a vector quantity",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "A vector changes, when it is displaced to itself",
  "explanation": "A unit vector is unit less and dimensionless. A vector cannot be divided by a vector as a vector cannot be divided by a direction. A vector does not change, when it is displaced to itself. Time, Pressure, Surface Tension, Current are some of the quantities that have direction but are not vectors. A physical quantity is a vector only when it follows commutative law of addition of vectors."
