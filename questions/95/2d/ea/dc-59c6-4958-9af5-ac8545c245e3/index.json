  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe members from United Kingdom will no longer attend the European Parliament as the union has entered the transition phase after the Brexit. The 73 former members of the European Parliament from UK have lost their seats and the PM is no longer an automatic attendee at the union’s council summits.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:   </strong>\nThe European Health Insurance Card will continue to remain valid inside UK and EU member countries during the transition period. Other aspects that won’t be affected after the Brexit are the acceptance of driving license, freedom of movement, etc.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:       </strong>\nThe European Court of Justice will continue to have a say in the legal disputes involving UK and the European Union member nations. The UK recently became the first country to leave the European Union. The Brexit discussions and process had started in 2013.\n&nbsp;"
