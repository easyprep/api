  "question": "In the set of {300, 301, 302, ...., 498, 499, 500}, How many numbers will be divisible by 3?",
  "option1": 200,
  "option2": 66,
  "option3": 67,
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 67,
  "explanation": "The very first number in this series {300, 301, 302, ...., 498, 499, 500} is 300 and last number is 498, so now we have to calculate the total numbers from 300 to 498, are divisible by 3 (498-300/3) + 1  = 67, here we added 1 because 498 and 300 both are divisible by 3. So the right answer is option (c)"
