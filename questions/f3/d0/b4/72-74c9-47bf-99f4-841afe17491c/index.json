  "question": "Consider the following statements: <ol> <li>The salinity of oceanic water is higher in equatorial region&nbsp;than in temperate region</li> <li>Dead sea is the saltiest water body in the world</li> </ol> &nbsp; Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "First statement is incorrect because salinity of oceanic water is higher in temperate regions due to low rainfall and high evaporation. Salinity is low in equatorial region because of heavy rainfall in equatorial region. Second statement is incorrect because Don Juan Pond is the saltiest water body in the world. It is a small and very shallow&nbsp;hyper saline&nbsp;lake in the west end of&nbsp;Wright Valley,&nbsp;Victoria Land in&nbsp;Antarctica. It is the saltiest water body known on earth as of now. It is said that Don Juan Pond is over 18 times the ocean&#039;s salinity and 1.3 times that of the Dead Sea."
