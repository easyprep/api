  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "Only 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "The major reason for the development of Tantricism was the Brahmanization and Sanskritization of hitherto forested and tribal areas. So first statement is incorrect. In Tantricism, women and Shudras both were allowed to be initiated. Thus, third statement is incorrect. Third statement is correct. In tribal societies women always have been given a higher status; and sexual rituals played an important role which according to tribal society promotes the fertility of the earth. In fact the role of woman in tantric practices is central due to her ability to reproduce; hence, she symbolizes the notion of fertility."
