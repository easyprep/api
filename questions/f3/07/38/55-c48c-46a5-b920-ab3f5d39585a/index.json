  "answer": "Article 1",
  "explanation": "Article 1(1) of the constitution of India says that “India, that is Bharat, shall be Union of States”. \r\nThough the term “federation’ has been used in context with India, yet technically, Federation is not a result of agreement between the units of which it is made up of. By the term “Union” we simply mean that the units of Indian federation have no freedom to recede from it."
