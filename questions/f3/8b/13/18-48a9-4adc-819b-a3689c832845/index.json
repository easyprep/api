  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThis is the first case of EEHV infection in captive elephants in India. The disease currently has no well-established medication. The virus attacks Asian Elephants but their related strains attack African Elephants. The Nandankanan Zoological Park lost 4 elephants to this disease.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe EEHV causes a haemorrhagic disease. It is highly fatal and causes death in 80% of the cases. The virus affects the skin and pulmonary (respiratory) system of the elephants. Some of the symptoms include increased heart rate, low blood cell count, lethargy, mouth ulcers, tongue cyanosis, etc.\n&nbsp;"
