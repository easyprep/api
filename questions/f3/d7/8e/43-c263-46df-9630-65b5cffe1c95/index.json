  "question": "The Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are the compounds which have the following molecules: \r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Hydrogen </li>\r\n<li>Carbon</li>\r\n<li>Chlorine</li>\r\n<li>Fluorine</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above plays the most important role in Ozone depletion?",
  "option1": "Hydrogen",
  "option2": "Carbon",
  "option3": "Chlorine",
  "option4": "Flourine",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Chlorine",
