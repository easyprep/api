  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Cote d'Ivoire",
  "explanation": "Cote d'Ivoire is the world's largest cocoa producer. It supplies 30% of the world's total cocoa. Cocoa industry alone provides two-thirds of the total revenue of Cote d'Ivoire. But this remarkable achievement is not without any criticisms because of the large-scale employment of child labourers subjected to exploitation and physical abuses."
