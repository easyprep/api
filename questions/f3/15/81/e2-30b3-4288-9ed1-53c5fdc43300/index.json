  "question": "At sea level, what is the difference between the value of acceleration due to gravity at the poles and at the equator?",
  "option1": "No difference",
  "option2": "9.8 cm s<sup>-2</sup>",
  "option3": "1.80 cm s<sup>-2</sup>",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1.80 cm s<sup>-2</sup>",
  "explanation": "At sea level, the difference between the value of acceleration due to gravity at the poles and at the equator is 1.80 cm s<sup>-2</sup>. The value of acceleration due to gravity increases as we go from equator to the poles."
