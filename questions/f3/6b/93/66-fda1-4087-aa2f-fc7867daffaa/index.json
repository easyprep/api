  "question": "In context with the Nuclear Fuels, how enriched Uranium is different than natural Uranium?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The Reactors with enriched Uranium as fuel follow different principle of fission as that of natural Uranium</li>\r\n<li>Enriched Uranium has a larger burn up value</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "Natural Uranium available in the ore contains only 0.7 percent of fissionable material such as U235. To increase the percentage of U235 in natural Uranium is called enrichment of natural Uranium. i.e. from 0.7% to above 1.5% and upto 3.5% for use in the light water reactors. The increase in percentage of enrichment of U235 is achieved by means of either centrifuge process or gaseous diffusion process. Reactors with enriched Uranium as fuel follow the same principle of fission as that of natural Uranium. Due to enrichment, light water is used as moderation for continuation of chain reaction. Burnup value of enriched Uranium fuelled reactor is more than that of natural Uranium fuel."
