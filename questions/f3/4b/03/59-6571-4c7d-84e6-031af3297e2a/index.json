  "option5": "",
  "answer": "India",
  "explanation": "India has become the biggest importer of U.S. oil refinery by-product 'petcoke', which in 2016 got almost a fourth of all the fuel-grade \"petcoke\" the U.S. shipped out. Petroleum coke called as 'petcoke', a U.S. oil refinery by-product, is cheaper and burns hotter than coal. But it also contains more planet-warming carbon and heart and lung-damaging sulfur.In 2016, the U.S. sent more than 8 million metric tonnes of petcoke to India. That's about 20 times more than in 2010.",
