It is a global initiative of the World Wide Fund for Nature India or WWF-India. This year, in 2018, WWF-India has launched the \"Give Up to Give Back\" initiative to inspire organisations, institutions and individuals to make the choice to curb some habits, practices and lifestyles that burden lives and environment. The campaign includes taking steps like giving up single-use plastics, fossil fuels and e-waste among others.",
