  "question": "Which IIT institutes have developed biosensor to detect kidney disorders?",
  "option1": "IIT Bombay and IIT Indore",
  "option2": "IIT Kanpur and IIT Bombay",
  "option3": "IIT Indore and IIT Delhi",
  "option4": "IIT Delhi and IIT Kanpur",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "IIT Bombay and IIT Indore",
  "explanation": "The Indian Institutes of Technology, Bombay and Indore, have jointly developed a biosensor that makes it possible to detect kidney disorders in less than 8 minutes. The biosensor can accurately measure both the pH and urea concentration with a single drop of urine. The researchers who developed it say that it will help make a point-of-care test to determine whether the kidneys are functioning normally. The biosensor is made by encapsulating an enzyme urease and a molecule FITC-dextran in alginate microspheres. The combination glows in response to a chemical reaction with urea and changes in pH when urine is added.",
