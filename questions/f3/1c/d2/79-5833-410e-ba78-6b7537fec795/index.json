  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "Workers actively participated in the Rowlatt Satyagraha (April 6, 1919), and the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-22). Despite the Communistâ€™s non-participation in the Civil Disobedience Movement and Quit India Movement, the workers actively participated in both, on their own. They went on strikes and hartals at Delhi, Lucknow, Kanpur, Bombay, Nagpur, Ahmedabad, Jamshedpur, Madras, Indore and Bangalore during the Quit India Movement in 1942. They showed vibrant enthusiasm during the INA trial and solidarity with the mutiny of the naval ratings in 1946. On February 22, 1946, about two to three lakh workers put down their tools in response to a call given by the Communists and the Socialists.<br />Thus, all statements are correct."
