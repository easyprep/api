  "option4": "Claim damages for an entire group of consumers of faulty product",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Recall an entire batch of faulty products",
  "explanation": "In April, 2020, consumers in India will be able to initiate class-action lawsuits and also opt for mediation under the new Consumer Protection Act 2019, which gives legal teeth to claims for damages over defective products or poor services. A class action suit is a legal tool that enables an individual complaint of a faulty product/service to be treated as an ‘interest group’ of other people in similar circumstances. The suit can be invoked to recall an entire batch of faulty products based on one complaint. If one lot of an item has a common defect, a single complaint can trigger its recall through ‘class action'."
