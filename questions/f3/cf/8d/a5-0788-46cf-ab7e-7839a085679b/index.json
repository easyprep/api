  "question": "Which of the following terms denotes the funds set aside by the banks to cover loan losses?",
  "option1": "Statutory Liquidity Ratio",
  "option2": "Provision Coverage Ratio",
  "option3": "Acid Ratio",
  "option4": "Liquidity Ratio",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Provision Coverage Ratio",
  "explanation": "PCR indicates extent of funds a bank has kept aside to cover loan losses. A higher provision coverage ratio leads to higher risk taking capacity of the bank. The desirable limit of PCR is 70% though not mandatory. Recently, we read in the newspapers that out of 21 public sector banks in India, only 6 have crossed the 'desirable' level of 70% Provision Coverage Ratio (PCR)."
