  "explanation": "The Sinai Peninsula is a peninsula located in Egypt. This is the only part of Egypt which is located in Asia. This peninsula is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, Red Sea to the south, Gulf of Suez to the southwest and Gulf of Aqaba to the southeast. This peninsula forms the land bridge between Asia and Africa. Mount Sinai is located in the peninsula is one of the most religiously significant places in the Abrahamic faiths. Israel invaded and occupied Sinai during the Suez Crisis (known in Egypt as the Tripartite Aggression due to the simultaneous coordinated attack by the UK, France and Israel) of 1956, and during the Six-Day War of 1967. On 6 October 1973, Egypt launched the Yom Kippur War to retake the peninsula, which was unsuccessful. In 1982, as a result of the Israelâ€“Egypt Peace Treaty of 1979, Israel withdrew from all of the Sinai Peninsula except the contentious territory of Taba, which was returned after a ruling by a commission of arbitration in 1989. Today, Sinai has become a tourist destination due to its natural setting, rich coral reefs, and biblical history."
