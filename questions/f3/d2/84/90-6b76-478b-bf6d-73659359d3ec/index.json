  "question": "Which of the following is / are correct statements about methane?\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>The largest reservoir of methane on earth is under the permafrost at arctic and Antarctic</li>\r\n \t<li>Methane has a tetrahedral structure and also known as Hydrogen Carbide</li>\r\n \t<li>Methane can be produced by Serpentinite method</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Methane has a tetrahedral structure, which is multiplanar, in which carbon atom lies at the centre and the four hydrogen atoms lie at the four corners of a regular tetrahedron. The largest reservoir of methane on earth is under the seafloor. Serpentinite method is a method of producing Methane by inorganic method."
