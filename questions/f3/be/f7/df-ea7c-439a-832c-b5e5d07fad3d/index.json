  "question": "Consider the following:<br> 1. Hypercalcaemia<br> 2. Hypercalciuria<br> 3. Hypocalcaemia<br> Which among the above Calcium related abnormalities are related to endocrine system of the body?<br> &nbsp;",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",

  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "Hypercalcaemia&nbsp; is an elevated calcium level in the blood. The effects of Hypercalcemia are groans, moans, bones, stones and Overtones. They refer to groans (constipation), moans (psychic moans (e.g., fatigue, lethargy, depression)), bones (bone pain, especially if PTH is elevated), stones (kidney stones), and psychiatric overtones (including depression and confusion. One more result is hypervitaminosis D (vitamin D intoxication). Hypercalciuria is the condition &nbsp;of elevated calcium in the urine, which may lead to problems in renal functions including Kidney problems. Hypocalcaemia (or hypocalcemia) is the &nbsp;presence of low serum calcium levels in the blood, which is associated with the Parathyroid Hormone. Same is with Hypocacemia which is due to Hyperparathyroid conditions. The Hypercalciuria is something related to intake of calcium via food."
