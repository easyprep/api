It once occurred from the Arabian Peninsula and the Near East to the Caspian region, Kyzylkum Desert and India, but has been extirpated there during the 20th century. The Asiatic cheetah survives in protected areas in the eastern-central arid region of Iran, where the human population density is very low.",
