  "answer": "Peshawar",
  "explanation": "The Khudai Khidmatgar (Servants of God), led by Frontier (Seemant) Gandhi Abdul Ghaffar Khan, was a Pashtun organisation committed to overthrowing the British rule through non-violent methods. On 23 April 1930, Ghaffar Khan was arrested after a speech urging resistance to the foreign rule. After more Khudai Khidmatgar leaders were arrested, a large number of Khudai Khidmatgar members gathered at Qissa Khwani Bazaar bazaar in Peshawar to protest. The British shot at the protesters killing around 200 people. Gunning down of unarmed people brought newly formed Khudai Khidmatgar movement into prominence. AK Hangal, the late actor, was witness to the above ghastly massacre, as a school student then in Peshawar."
