  "question": "What is the relationship between excess pressure and the radius of the bubble?",
  "option1": "are equal in value",
  "option2": "inversely proportional to each other",
  "option3": "directly proportional to each other",
  "option4": "no relationship",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "inversely proportional to each other",
  "explanation": "Excess pressure is inversely proportional to the radius of bubble (or drop). It means that the pressure inside a smaller bubble is higher than inside a larger bubble."
