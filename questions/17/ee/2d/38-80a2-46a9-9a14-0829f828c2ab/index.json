  "question": "What is the reason behind the Less dew on cloudy nights?",
  "option1": "Clouds absorb the falling dew",
  "option2": "Clouds scatter moisture",
  "option3": "In cloudy nights the radiation takes place very slowly",
  "option4": "In cloudy nights the radiation takes place very quickly",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "In cloudy nights the radiation takes place very slowly",
  "explanation": "Dew usually forms the night following a warm day and will stick around until early the next morning. Overnight, the Earth radiates heat from the ground into the air. As the Earth radiates this heat, the ground cools. As the ground cools, it cools the layer of air closest to the surface. <br />Cloudy nights are less likely to experience dew formation at the Earth\\'s surface because radiation cooling is reduced. Wind will also reduce the chance of dew formation as it reduces the humidity of the air in contact with the ground."
