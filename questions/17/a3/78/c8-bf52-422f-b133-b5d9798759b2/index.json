  "answer": "Nature for Water",
  "explanation": "The World Water Day (WWD) is observed every year on 22 March to raise awareness about the importance of water. The 2018 theme \\'Nature for Water\\' is exploring nature-based solutions to the water challenges the world faces in the 21st century. The day is about focusing on the importance of water and the need to preserve it. The day encourages people not to waste one of the most important elements that sustain life on the planet. An international day to celebrate freshwater was recommended at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro. The United Nations General Assembly responded by designating 22 March 1993 as the first World Water Day."
