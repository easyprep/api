  "question": "The population pyramids can be helpful to determine which of the following?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>population growth rates.</li>\r\n<li>age-sex distribution of a population</li>\r\n<li>birth rates and death rates</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "A population pyramid shows the distribution of various age groups in a population which forms the shape of a pyramid when the population is growing. It is also used in ecology to determine the overall age distribution of a population; an indication of the reproductive capabilities and likelihood of the continuation of a species. In this question, only 2 would be a correct option, rest two will be opted out."
