  "question": "A water tank can be filled by a tap in 30 minutes and another tap can fill it in 60 minutes. If both the taps are kept open for 5 minutes and then the first tap is closed, how long will it take for the tank to be full?",
  "option1": "20 minutes",
  "option2": "25 minutes",
  "option3": "30 minutes",
  "option4": "45 minutes",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "45 minutes",
  "explanation": "Part of the tank filled by both taps in 5 minutes\r\n$latex = 5\\\\left ( \\\\frac{1}{30}+\\\\frac{1}{60} \\\\right )&s=1$\r\n$latex = 5\\\\left ( \\\\frac{2+1}{60} \\\\right ) = 5\\\\times \\\\frac{3}{60} = \\\\frac{1}{4}&s=1$\r\nRemaining part $latex = 1-\\\\frac{1}{4} = \\\\frac{3}{4}&s=1$ that is fileed by second tap. \r\n$latex \\\\therefore Time\\\\ taken\\\\ = \\\\frac{3}{4}\\\\times 60 = 45\\\\ minutes&s=1$\r\nHence option [D] is correct answer."
