On 14th July 2019, England lifted their first-ever ICC World Cup cricket trophy after defeating New Zealand in a nerve-wracking final that was decided via a dramatic Super Over in London. Opting to bat, New Zealand put up a modest 241 for eight. In reply, England ended at the same score leading to the one-over eliminator at the Lord\\'s.  In the Super Over, England batted first and the duo of Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler made 15, and New Zealand also ended at the same score but for the loss of one wicket, paving the way for an English victory on boundary count.  England\\'s Ben Stokes is named player of the match for a heroic knock of 84 not out off 92 balls."
