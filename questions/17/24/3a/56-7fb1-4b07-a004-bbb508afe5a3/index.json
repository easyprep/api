  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Nepal",
  "explanation": "The Rs 325 crore Motihari- Amlekhgunj petroleum pipeline project has been successfully completed & will start commercial operation by August 2019. The 69-Km long petroleum pipeline from Motihari in Bihar to Amelkhgunj in Nepal has been constructed by India. It will ensure smooth, cost effective and environment friendly supply of petroleum products to Nepal. The pipeline will help in tackling the oil storage problem in Nepal and doing away with transportation of petroleum products through tankers. Hence, Nepal will officially start fuel trade with India via the pipeline after its virtual launch by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi. The Motihari-Amlekhgunj oil pipeline project was first proposed in 1996. However, the project finally edged closer to reality during Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s visit to Kathmandu in 2014."
