It was in news when the train service was suspended due to frequent derailments of the train. The Neral-Matheran railway line was built between 1901 and 1907 by Adamji Peerbhoy, an Indian philanthropist. Matheran was discovered by Hugh Poyntz Malet, the then district collector of Thane district in May 1850. Lord Elphinstone, the Governor of Bombay laid the foundations of the development and the British developed it as a popular resort to escape the summer heat."
