Under the campaign, a child suffering from pneumonia can be treated with pre-referral dose of anti-biotic amoxicillin by ASHA workers, and health and wellness centres can use pulse oximeter (device to monitor oxygen saturation) to identify low oxygen levels in the blood of a child, and if required, treat him by use of oxygen cylinders. The campaign will mobilize people to protect children from pneumonia, and train health personnel and other stakeholders to provide prioritized treatment to control the disease."
