According to tradition, Buddha spent 19 rainy seasons in Jetavana monastery and six in Pubbarama monastery. He spent more time in Sravasti than in any other place and performed his major miracles there, including the Twin Miracle under the Gandamba tree. It was also a place where Buddha delivered largest number of discourses."
