  "question": "In context with the release of the Production Gap report in November, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The Production Gap report was published by the International Energy Agency.</li>\n<li>It depends on technologies like carbon capture and natural gas powered systems.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong> Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Production Gap report was published by the United Nations Environment grouping. It is considered as a more accurate picture of the world energy scenario than International Energy Agency’s report called World Energy Outlook that was released earlier in November.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Production Gap report is unique in that it factors in the uncertainties surrounding technologies like carbon capture, carbon storage, negative emission technology, etc. It also highlights the dangers posed by mismatch between planned fossil fuel production and climate commitments."
