The museum had witnessed a record footfall of 20,569 visitors on a single day on March 20. Hence, the \\\"Asia Book of Records\\\" had confirmed the record of \\\"maximum footfall in a museum in a day\\\" in the name of Virasat-e-Khalsa, which would feature in the next edition of the Asia Book of Records. Earlier, the museum  was listed in the \\\"Limca Book of Records-February 2019 Edition\\\" and \\\"India Book of Records-2020 Edition\\\". The museum was built by Punjab Government and was inaugurated in November 2011. The iconic museum stands out in terms of popularity, visitor footfall, architecture, grandeur and aesthetics; as also in its use of technology, infrastructure and world class standards of maintenance and upkeep."
