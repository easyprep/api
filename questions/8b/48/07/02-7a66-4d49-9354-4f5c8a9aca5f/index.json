  "question": "In context with the recent studies about sinking of river deltas, consider the following statements about this geographical feature:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Earth is the only planet with delta features.</li>\n<li>The Ganga-Brahmaputra delta is the largest in the world.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nDelta is a geographical feature formed at the point of convergence of a river with a large body of water like ocean, lake, reservoir, etc. Apart from earth, Mars also shows delta features. These are indications that the red planet once possessed large volumes of flowing water.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Ganga Brahmaputra delta is the largest delta in the world. It stretches between India and Bangladesh. Deltas are regions with dense population settlement. This is a consequence of the fertile alluvial soil supporting agricultural development. The Ganga delta is expected to see an 81% drop in sedimentation."
