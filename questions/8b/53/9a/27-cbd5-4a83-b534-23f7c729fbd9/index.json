  "question": "Which state cabinet has approved the nomination of at least one differently abled member to each panchayat?",
  "option1": "UP",
  "option2": "Odisha",
  "option3": "Rajasthan",
  "option4": "Chhattisgarh",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Chhattisgarh",
  "explanation": "By amending the State Panchayati Raj Act of 1993, the Chhattisgarh Cabinet has made it mandatory the presence of at least one differently-abled member to each panchayat. If differently abled members are not elected through the electoral process, then one member - either male or female - would be nominated as a panch. The state will now have 11,000 persons with disabilities as representatives at the panchayat level. The state Cabinet also decided to drop the educational qualifications eligibility criterion for contesting panchayat elections."
