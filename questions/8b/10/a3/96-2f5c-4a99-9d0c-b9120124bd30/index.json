  "question": "How much loan amount has been approved by the World Bank (WB) for the National Hydrology Project of India?",
  "option1": "$175 million",
  "option2": "$210 million",
  "option3": "$222 million",
  "option4": "$325 million",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "$175 million",
  "explanation": "The World Bank (WB) has recently approved the $175 million loan for the national hydrology project to improve Indiaâ€™s ability to forecast floods and reduce vulnerability to recurring floods and droughts. The loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) has a 6-year grace period in which no interest payments will be due. The loan will mature in 23 years. The move will help in reducing the vulnerability of many regions to recurring floods and droughts as absence of real-time ground information for the entire country creates difficulties in issuing alerts on time."
