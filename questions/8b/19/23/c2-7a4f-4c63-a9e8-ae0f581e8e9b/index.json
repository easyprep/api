The Government of Goa sent a request in July 2002 to the Central Government under Section 3 of the Inter-State River Water Disputes (ISRWD) Act, 1956 for constitution of a Tribunal for adjudication of the water disputes with State of Karnataka relating to Mahadayi River. The Act requires that Central Government shall constitute a tribunal if it is of the opinion that a water dispute cannot be settled by negotiation. The Ministry of Water Resources (MoWR) made efforts to resolve the dispute. However, a solution acceptable to both the States could not emerge. The Central Government issued a Notification No. S.O. 2786 (E) dated 16th November, 2010 constituting a Tribunal called as &#8220;the Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal&#8221; for the adjudication of water disputes relating to the inter-State river Mahadayi and the river valley thereof, consisting of: (1) Hon’ble Mr. Justice J.M.
