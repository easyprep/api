  "question": "Which generic steroid drug has been found to reduce deaths by a third for patients affected by COVID-19?",
  "option1": "Dexamethasone",
  "option2": "Aspirin",
  "option3": "Indomethacin",
  "option4": "Naproxen",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Dexamethasone",
  "explanation": "Scientists in UK have claimed that the generic steroid drug dexamethasone has reduced deaths by up to one third in severely ill hospitalised patients, affected by COVID-19.\r\nThis result is a part of one of the worldâ€™s largest randomised trial of drugs to treat COVID-19 patients, that also showed hydroxychloroquine was not working against the coronavirus. The drug is shown to cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators and a fifth for those on oxygen. However, World Health Organisation said that the drug is reserved for severely ill and critical patients."
