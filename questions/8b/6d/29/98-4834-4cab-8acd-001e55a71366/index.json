  "explanation": "Fundamental rights are binding upon not only the State and agencies of State but also upon individuals/organizations. If untouchability or any sort of discrimination is practiced by any individual then that individual indulging in such practices is punishable under the law of the land. Article 12 gives the definition of State as including not only the executive and legislative organs of the Union and the States but also local bodies and other authorities. Even the act of any individual may become an act of the State if it is enforced or aided by any of the authorities mentioned above. Certain Fundamental Rights are also available against private individuals like Article 15(2) [equality with regard to access to and use of places of public resort], Article 17 [prohibition of traffic in human beings], Article 18(3)-(4) [prohibition of acceptance of foreign title], Article 23 [prohibition of traffic in human beings] and Article 24 [prohibition of employment of children in hazardous employment]."
