  "answer": "London",
  "explanation": "London has become the world’s first city to implement a special Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) that would charge an entry fee for older vehicles if they do not meet the emission standards. The move aims to reduce toxic air pollution and protect public health. , The ULEZ will be operational for 24 hours and 7 days a week. It will help address London\\'s toxic air health crisis that currently leads to thousands of premature deaths annually, and increases the risk of asthma, cancer and dementia. As part of the efforts to combat air pollution, London\\'s famous red bus fleet is also being upgraded. By October 2020, all of 9,200 vehicles will meet or exceed ULEZ standards, as per the statement from Khan\\'s mayoral office."
