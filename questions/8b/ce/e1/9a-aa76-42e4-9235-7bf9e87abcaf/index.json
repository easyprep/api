  "question": "In present times, the Salt mines are considered to be the safest means for the disposal of the Radioactive Wastes. What could be the possible advantages offered by the salt mines in this<br> context?<br> 1. Salt absorbs the radioactive waves<br> 2. Salt heals its own fractures because of its plastic quality<br> 3. Good quality salt beds are separated from ground water<br> 4. Salt Beds have property of great seismic stability<br> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1, 2 & 3 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 2, 3 & 4 are correct",
  "option3": "1, 2, 3 & 4 are correct",
  "option4": "Only 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2, 3 & 4 are correct",
  "explanation": "The first option given as &#8220;Salt absorbs the radioactive waves&#8221; is not correct and rest three statements are correct. Most deposits of salt are found in stable geological areas with very little earthquake activity; assuring the stability of a waste repository. Then, the salt deposits demonstrate the absence of flowing fresh water that could move waste to the surface. Water, if it had been or was present, would have dissolved the salt beds. Moreover, Rock salt heals its own fractures because of its plastic quality. That is, salt formations will slowly and progressively move in to fill mined areas and safely seal radioactive waste from the environment. A thick salt deposit will effectively isolate the buried radioactivity from the environment for millions of years."
