  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are incorrect",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe governor is appointed by the president in accordance with article 156 of constitution. Article 54 deals with the election of the president. The president appoints both the governors and lieutenant governors. The governor is the nominal or de jure head of states while the chief minister is the de facto head.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nIn accordance with 7<sup>th</sup> constitutional amendment act, 1956, a person can be appointed the governor of 2 or more states. This led to the introduction of article 153 in the constitution. This amendment act was the one that resulted in the formation of Union Territory.\n<strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong>\nUnlike the president, the governor does not have a fixed term. Usually, the governor holds office for 5 years. However, early termination is possible in 2 cases: dismissal by the president or resignation by the governor. There is no provision for impeachment.\n&nbsp;"
