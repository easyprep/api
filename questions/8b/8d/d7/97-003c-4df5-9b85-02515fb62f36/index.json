  "explanation": "Pediplain is a landform formed by the coalescence of pediments. Pediplantation is the process through which pediplains are formed. The concept of pediplains and pediplantation was developed by geologist Lester Charles King in 1942. Cryoplantation is the variant of pediplantation restricted to the cold areas. Pediplains are generally found in arid and semi-arid areas.<br />"
