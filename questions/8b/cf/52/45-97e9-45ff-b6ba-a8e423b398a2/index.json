  "question": "In what time will 10000 Rs. amount to 13310 Rs. at 20% per annum compounded half yearly?",
  "option1": "$latex 3years$",
  "option2": "$latex 2\\frac{1}{2}years&s=1$",
  "option3": "$latex 2years$",
  "option4": "$latex 1\\frac{1}{2}years&s=1$",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "$latex 1\\frac{1}{2}years&s=1$",
  "explanation": "The rate of interest is compounded half yearly,\r\nâˆ´ r = 10% per half year\r\nLet time $latex = \\\\frac{T}{2}years &s=1$ = half years\r\nAccording to the question,\r\n$latex Amount = P \\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{R}{100} \\\\right )^{t}&s=1$\r\n$latex => 13310 = 10000\\\\left ( 1+\\\\frac{10}{100} \\\\right )^{T}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{13310}{10000} = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{11}{10} \\\\right )^{T}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\left ( \\\\frac{11}{10} \\\\right )^{T} = \\\\frac{1331}{1000} = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{11}{10} \\\\right )^{3}&s=1$\r\n=> T = 3 half years $latex = 1\\\\frac{1}{2} years&s=1$\r\nHence option [D] is correct answer."
