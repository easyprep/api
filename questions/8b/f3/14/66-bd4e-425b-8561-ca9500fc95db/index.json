  "question": "Which country houses \"Cara Sucia\" archaeological site?",
  "option1": "Gautemala",
  "option2": "Belize",
  "option3": "Honduras",
  "option4": "El Salvador",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "El Salvador",
  "explanation": "Cara Sucia is a Mesoamerican archaeological site in western El Salvador. The site was first settled in the Preclassic period and was finally abandoned around 900 AD, in the Terminal Classic, when the Pipil people moved into the region, although there is no evidence of Pipil occupation at the site. It is thought that during the Early Preclassic (1200â€“500 BC), the site was occupied by people who spoke a forerunner of the Mayan languages, and during the Late Preclassic period, the site has evidence of contact with Chalchuapa and with Kaminaljuyu in the Guatemalan Highlands."
