  "question": "Three pipes A, B and C can fill a tank in 6 hours, 9 hours and 12 hours respectively. B and C are opened for half an hour, then A is also opened. The time taken by the three pipes together to fill the remaining part of the tank is :",
  "option1": "2 hours",
  "option2": "2.5 hours",
  "option3": "3 hours",
  "option4": "3.5 hours",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2.5 hours",
  "explanation": "Part of the tank filled by pipe B and C in half an hour\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left ( \\\\frac{1}{9}+\\\\frac{1}{12} \\\\right )&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left ( \\\\frac{4+3}{36} \\\\right ) = \\\\frac{7}{72}&s=1$\r\nRemaining part $latex = 1- \\\\frac{7}{72} = \\\\frac{72-7}{72} = \\\\frac{65}{72}&s=1$\r\nPart of the tank filled by three pipes in an hour\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{1}{6}+\\\\frac{1}{9}+\\\\frac{1}{12}&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{6+4+3}{36} = \\\\frac{13}{36}&s=1$\r\nâˆ´ Time to fill remaining part \r\n$latex = \\\\frac{65}{72}\\\\times \\\\frac{36}{13} = \\\\frac{5}{2} = 2\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ hours&s=1$\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer."
