  "answer": "Jeremy Bentham",
  "explanation": "Harold Laski, L.T. Hobhouse and T.H. Green developed the positive concept of liberty. Green postulated a theory of rights and insisted on the positive role of the state in creating conditions under which men could effectively exercise their moral freedom. Hobhouse and Laski postulated that private property was no absolute right, and that the state must secure the welfare of the people - no matter if it is constrained to certain economic liberty of the privileged few."
