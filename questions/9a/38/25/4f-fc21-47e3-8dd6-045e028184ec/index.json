  "question": "What is common between the teachings of Gautam Buddha and Mahavira?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Both emphasized upon Ahimsa</li>\r\n<li>Both rejected existence of soul</li>\r\n<li>Both rejected existence of god</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "The first statement is correct. Regarding the second statement, we note that while Buddha rejected the existance of soul, Mahavira regarded all objects, both animate and inanimate, have souls and various degrees of consciousness.<br />The third statement is also incorrect (partially) because Buddha neither accepts god nor rejects the existence of god. This was one of his great silences. He laid great emphasis on the law of karma. He argued that the condition of man in this life depends upon his own deeds. On the other hand, Mahavira states that there is no distinct existence of God. He rejected the idea of God as a creator, protector and the destroyer."
