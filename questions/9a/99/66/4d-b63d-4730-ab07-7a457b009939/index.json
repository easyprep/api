  "question": "The scientists at which IIT have developed two-finger robotic hand to help paralysed stroke patients?",
  "option1": "IIT-Bombay",
  "option2": "IIT-Delhi",
  "option3": "IIT-Kanpur",
  "option4": "IIT-Indore",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "IIT-Kanpur",
  "explanation": "The scientists at the IIT-Kanpur have developed two-finger robotic hand (exoskeleton) to help paralysed stroke patients. For the exoskeleton, Prof. Ashish Dutta and Prof. KS Venkatesh  have partnered with the University of Ulster (based in the United Kingdom) and their teacher Girijesh Prasad, who belongs to Gorakhpur. The exoskeleton uses a four-bar mechanism and has four degrees of freedom (DOF). It can be used by a patient on the hand. It uses brain signals, with the help of the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) that is worn on the head, and helps paralyzed patients to open and close the movement of their thumb, forefinger and middle fingers for physical practice. The exoskeleton is operated by a MEGA microcontroller of 300 Mhz and powered by a battery. The device will cost around Rs 15,000."
