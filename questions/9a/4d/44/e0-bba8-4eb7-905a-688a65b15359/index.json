  "question": "From which of the following Pumice is derived?",
  "option1": "Volcanic rock",
  "option2": "Sedimentary rock",
  "option3": "Igneous rock",
  "option4": "Acid lava",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Volcanic rock",
  "explanation": "The vesicles are actually gas bubbles that were trapped in the rock during the rapid cooling of a gas-rich frothy magma. The material cools so quickly that atoms in the melt are not able to arrange themselves into a crystalline structure. Thus, pumice is an amorphous volcanic glass known as a \\\"mineraloid.\\\""
