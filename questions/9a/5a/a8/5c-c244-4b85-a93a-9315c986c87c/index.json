'Global Hunger Index' carried out by International Food Policy Research Institute chalked out nations that fall under 'Starving' category. The 100 out of 119 countries on the GHI, while last year it was at 97 out of 118. Even though India's 2017 GHI score-31.4-has improved over the years, its hunger problem remains categorized as \"serious.\" The rankings are based on four indicators: undernourishment, child mortality, child wasting, and child stunting. A GHI score of between 20 and 34.9 points reflects serious hunger levels; between 35 and 49.9, it is alarming, and extremely alarming if over 50.",
