  "question": "Which among the following play role in Global Warming?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Water Vapour</li>\r\n<li>Laughing Gas</li>\r\n<li>Carbon Monoxide</li>\r\n<li>Carbon Dioxide</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option2": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 4",
  "option4": "Only 1 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "All of them. Nitrous Oxide is laughing gas, rest three are GHG. Please note that as it is, Carbon monoxide (CO) is only a very weak and insignificant greenhouse gas, but has important indirect effects on global warming. Carbon monoxide reacts with hydroxyl (OH) radicals in the atmosphere, reducing their abundance. As OH radicals help to reduce the lifetimes of strong greenhouse gases. like methane, carbon monoxide indirectly increases the global warming potential of these gases. Carbon monoxide in the atmosphere can also lead to the formation of the Ground level Ozone."
