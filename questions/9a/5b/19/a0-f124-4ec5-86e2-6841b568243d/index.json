  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is correct</u>. Hung Parliament is a situation when no political party or pre-poll alliance gets an absolute majority in Lok Sabha elections. <u>Second statement is correct</u>. In India, when elections results produce a hung parliament, then President can use his discretionary power to appoint prime minister. Article 75 (1) of the Constitution of India reads: “The Prime Minister shall be appointed by the President and the other Ministers shall be appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister.”Normally, the choice of Prime Minister will be decided by the party position in the House of the People. However, if the party position is not clear, the President will have to decide in her or his ‘discretion’ whom to invite to become the Prime Minister."
