  "answer": "Mumbai",
  "explanation": "On 7-8 August 1942, Quit India Resolution was passed by the AICC at its meeting at Gowalia Tank in Mumbai, and Gandhi launched the Movement on 8 August 1942. On 9 August 1942, almost all the top Congress leaders were arrested. By and large, ‘Quit India’ fizzled out by the end of September 1942. The speed with which the administration was able to suppress ‘Quit India’ surprised the world media."
