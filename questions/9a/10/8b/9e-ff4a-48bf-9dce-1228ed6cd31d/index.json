  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are correct",
  "explanation": "The doctrine of Adi Sankara is advaita vedanta. It is mainly opposing the Mimamnsa school of thought. Advaita (“non-dualism”) is often called a monistic system of thought. The word “Advaita” essentially refers to the identity of the Self (Atman) and the Whole (Brahman). According to Adi Shankara, God, the Supreme Cosmic Spirit or Brahman is the One, the whole and the only reality. Other than Brahman, everything else, including the universe, material objects and individuals, are false. Brahman is at best described as that infinite, omnipresent, omnipotent, incorporeal, impersonal, transcendent reality that is the divine ground of all Being. Brahman is often described as neti-neti meaning “not this, not this” because Brahman cannot be correctly described as this or that."
