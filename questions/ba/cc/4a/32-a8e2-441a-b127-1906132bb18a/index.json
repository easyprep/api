  "question": "Consider the following statements with regard to Zearalenone. 1. It is a fungal toxin infesting cereals such as wheat, maize and barley. 2. It attacks crops even when they have dried fully in storage. Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 only",
  "option2": "2 only",
  "option3": "Both 1 and 2",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 only",
  "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: Zearalenone is a nonsteroidal estrogenic mycotoxin produced by numerous Fusarium molds (fungi) that can contaminate corn and grains and occasionally hays, straws, and silages. Zearalenone behaves like oestrogen, the female sex hormone, and could cause endocrine disturbances in humans. Statement 2 is incorrect: It can attack grains them while they are growing, but can also develop when cereals are stored without being dried fully."
