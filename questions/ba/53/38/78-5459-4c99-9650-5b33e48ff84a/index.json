  "option1": "Malaysia",
  "option2": "Philippines",
  "option3": "Indonesia",
  "option4": "Brunei",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Indonesia",
  "explanation": "Indonesia has renamed the northern reaches of its exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea as the North Natuna Sea on July 14, 2017. It is the latest act of resistance by Southeast Asian nations to China\\'s territorial ambitions in the maritime region. The part of the renamed sea is claimed by China under its contentious maritime boundary, known as the \\\"nine-dash line\\\", that encompasses most of the resource-rich sea. It should be noted that the South China Sea is a crucial shipping route and believed to be rich in natural resources, such as oil and gas."
