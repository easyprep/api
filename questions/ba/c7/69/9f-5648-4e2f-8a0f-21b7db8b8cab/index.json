SDGs were adopted in 2015.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nUNDP publishes the Human Development Report. This annual report is being published since 1990 to give an assessment of developmental progress across the world. It is recognised as an ‘independent intellectual exercise’. It is given by the UNDP Human Development Report office."
