  "question": "One joule of work is said to be done when__:",
  "option1": "a force of 1 dyne causes a displacement of 1 cm.",
  "option2": "a force of 1 dyne causes a displacement of 1 m.",
  "option3": "a force of 1 N causes a displacement of 1 cm.",
  "option4": "a force of 1 N causes a displacement of 1 m.",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "a force of 1 N causes a displacement of 1 m.",
  "explanation": "The joule is the unit of energy in the International System of Units. It is equal to the work done on an object when a force of one Newton acts on that object in the direction of the force's motion through a distance of one meter. One joule of work is said to be done when a force of 1 N causes a displacement of 1 m."
