  "question": "With reference to the IPCC report highlighting the need to protect biodiversity, consider the following statements about marine protected areas:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>10% of the world’s oceans are protected as MPAs.</li>\n<li>The MPAs affects the fishing industry’s profits.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nOnly 3% of the world oceans are ‘highly protected’. UN had set the goal to achieve protected area accounting for 10% of the oceans. Till date, only about 8% protection has been achieved. The measures are impeded by ‘paper parks’- lack of progress from declaration to implementation.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe MPAs see a conflict between need for conservation and need for fish rich waters to fuel the fishing industries. However, the MPAs’ establishment is directly linked to improved fish stock in the surrounding unprotected area. This is of benefit to the fishing sector."
