  "question": "What happens to a bar magnet of dipole moment (m) is placed in a uniform magnetic field (B)?",
  "option1": "the force on the bar magnet is zero",
  "option2": "the torque on the bar magnet is m × B",
  "option3": "Both a and b",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both a and b",
  "explanation": "When a bar magnet of dipole moment m is placed in a uniform magnetic field B: (a) the force on it is zero, (b) the torque on it is m × B, (c) its potential energy is –m.B, where we choose the zero of energy at the orientation when m is perpendicular to B."
