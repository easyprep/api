  "question": "A number when divided by 296 gives a remainder 75. When the same number is divided by 37, the remainder will be :",
  "option1": 1,
  "option2": 2,
  "option3": 8,
  "option4": 11,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 1,
  "explanation": "Let number be x. \r\nâˆ´ x =  296 $latex \\\\times$ Q + 75 where Q is the quotient and can have the value 1, 2, 3 etc. \r\n= 37 $latex \\\\times$ 8 $latex \\\\times$ Q + 37 $latex \\\\times$ 2 + 1\r\n= 37 (8Q + 2) + 1\r\nThus we see that the remainder is 1.\r\nHence option [A] is right answer."
