  "question": "Non-excludable and non-rivalrous are characteristics of which of the following types of goods?",
  "option1": "Public goods",
  "option2": "Merit goods",
  "option3": "Capital goods",
  "option4": "Consumer goods",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Public goods",
  "explanation": "In economics, a good or service is called excludable if it is possible to prevent people (consumers) who have not paid for it from having access to it. A good is considered non-rivalrous or non-rival if, for any level of production, the cost of providing it to a marginal (additional) individual is zero. A public good is a product that one individual can consume without reducing its availability to another individual, and from which no one is excluded. Economists refer to public goods as &quot;nonrivalrous&quot; and &quot;no excludable.&quot; National defense, sewer systems, public parks and other basic societal goods can all be considered public goods. For example, if a person does not pay his taxes, he still benefits from the government's provision of national defense by free riding on the tax payments of his fellow citizens. A dam is another example of a public good."
