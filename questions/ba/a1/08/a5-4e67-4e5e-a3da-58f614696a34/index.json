  "explanation": "Captain Aarohi Pandit, a 23-year-old pilot from Mumbai, has become the world\\'s first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean solo in a Light Sports Aircraft (LSA). She completed the feat when she landed at Iqaluit Airport in Canada on 13 May, having flown there from Wick in the UK. Her journey was broken into five legs, with stops at Iceland and Greenland. It also made Pandit the first female pilot in the world to successfully complete a solo flight across the Greenland ice cap in an LSA. This is part of her ongoing year-long global circumnavigation flight which was launched by friend Keithair Misquitta on July 30. Both the friends began their trip for Women Empower (WE) Expedition in the tiny aircraft christened ‘Mahi’ in August 2018. \\'Mahi\\' is a tiny, single-engine Sinus 912 weighing a little of 400 kg or nearly equivalent to a Bullet motorcycle, manufactured by Pipistrel of Slovenia, and is also the first LSA registered by Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) India."
