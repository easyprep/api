  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "Convention on Cybercrime is also known as Budapest Convention. Currently, it is the only binding multilateral treaty instrument aimed at combating cybercrime. <u>So, the first statement is correct</u>. It was drafted by the Council of Europe with active participation from its observer states in 2001. The Convention provides a framework for international cooperation between state parties to the treaty. It is open for ratification even to states that are not members of the Council of Europe. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u>. India has neither signed nor ratified the convention. The Home Ministry recently proposed for becoming a member of the Budapest Convention in order to push digital India and get rid of increase in cybercrime activities. However, the same was opposed by the Intelligence Bureau (IB) on the grounds that sharing data with foreign law enforcement agencies infringes on national sovereignty and may jeopardise the rights of individuals."
