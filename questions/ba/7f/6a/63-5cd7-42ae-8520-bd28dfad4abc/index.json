  "question": "In light of the union budget highlighting the importance of balanced use of fertilisers, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>2:4:1 is the desirable ratio of N:P:K fertiliser application.</li>\n<li>Nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas emitted by fertilisers.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe ideal proportion of nitrogen: phosphorus: potassium in fertilisers is 4:2:1. However, the fertilisers used in India are skewed greatly towards nitrogen. Eg: Punjab uses 31:8:1 ratio of N:P:K in its fields. This decreases the soil productivity while increasing soil alkalinity and salinity.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nNitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas emitted by chemical fertilisers upon decomposition. It is a noted ozone depleting compound. Apart from this, overuse of nitrogen based fertilisers pollute both the surface and the groundwater. The major reason for fertiliser overuse in India is the high level of urea subsidisation."
