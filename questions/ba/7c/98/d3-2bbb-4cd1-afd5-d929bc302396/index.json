  "question": "A cell increases in volume when it is placed in which of the following?",
  "option1": "Hypotonic solution",
  "option2": "Isotonic solution",
  "option3": "Hypertonic solution",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Hypotonic solution",
  "explanation": "Hypotonic solution is hypotonic to a cell if it has a lower solute concentration than the cell does. Osmosis draws water out of the solution and into the cells. As a result, plant and animal cells both appear more plump when placed in a hypotonic solution."
