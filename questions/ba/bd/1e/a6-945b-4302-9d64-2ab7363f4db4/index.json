  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct - Panda bonds are onshore yuan- or renminbi-denominated debt issued in China by overseas companies. In 2005 the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) issued the first “Panda” bonds. <br />Statement 2 is incorrect – They would be issued by non-Chinese investors but would be denominated in Renminbi. Thus they would help China to diversify its currency into other countries and help the issuer country to raise foreign exchange.<br />Statement 3 is correct - The federal cabinet of Pakistan approved the issuance of Pakistan’s first renminbi-denominated bonds to raise loans from Chinese capital markets. This will help Pakistan rely less on Dollar and gather funds for development."
