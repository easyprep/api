  "explanation": "The Chixoy River is a river in Guatemala. The river is called Rio Negro from its sources in the highlands of Huehuetenango and El Quiche until it reaches the Chixoy hydroelectric dam, where the Rio Salama and Rio Carchela converge with the Rio Negro. After the Chixoy dam, the river is called Rio Chixoy and flows northwards, until it reaches the border with Mexico. From there on it continues along the border as the Salinas river until it finally converges with the Rio la Pasion to form the Usumacinta River which flows into the Gulf of Mexico.",
