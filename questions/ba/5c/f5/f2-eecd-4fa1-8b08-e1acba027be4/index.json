  "question": "\"Right to vote\" can be placed in which among the following categories?",
  "option1": "Fundamental Right",
  "option2": "Constitutional Obligation",
  "option3": "Fundamental Duty",
  "option4": "Legal Right",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Legal Right",
  "explanation": "Right to Vote in India is a legal right given to the people by Representation of the people Act, 1950, section 62(1). This act can take away this right due to non-residence, unsoundness of mind and criminal conviction. Thus, its a legal right. Further, Article 326 of the constitution mentions that the election to Lok Sabha and State Assemblies will be based on adult suffrage. This implies that all above 18 years age are to be enrolled as voters. This makes the right to vote as a Constitutional Right also. However, it is a general provision to include a class (age 18 and above) and this provision itself does not provide or take away right to vote. Thus, Right to Vote should be considered to be a Legal right."
