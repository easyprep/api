  "question": "What is the lock in period for ELSS Investments currently?",
  "option1": "2 years",
  "option2": "3 years",
  "option3": "4 years",
  "option4": "5 years",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "3 years",
  "explanation": "Every investment permitted under Section 80C comes with a mandatory lock-in period. ELSS investments come with a lock-in period of three years which is lowest among Section 80C investments.Â  Public Provident Fund (PPF) and National Savings Certificate (NSC), traditional favourites, come with longer lock-in period. PPF is essentially a 15-year product, whereas NSC has a lock-in period of five years."
