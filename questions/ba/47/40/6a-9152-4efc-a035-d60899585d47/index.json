  "question": "A train covers a distance of 10 km in 12 minutes. If its speed is decreased by 5 km/hr, the time taken by it to cover the same distance is equal to :",
  "option1": "$latex 20\\ minutes$",
  "option2": "$latex 15\\ minutes$",
  "option3": "$latex \\frac{40}{3}\\ minutes&s=1$",
  "option4": "$latex 40\\ minutes$",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "$latex \\frac{40}{3}\\ minutes&s=1$",
  "explanation": "Time = 12 minutes $latex = \\\\frac{12}{60}\\\\ hours = \\\\frac{1}{5}\\\\ hours&s=1$\r\nSpeed of train = \r\n$latex = \\\\frac{10}{\\\\frac{1}{5}} = 50\\\\ km/hr&s=1$\r\nNew speed  = 50 - 5 = 45 km/hr\r\n$latex \\\\therefore Required\\\\ Time = \\\\frac{Distance}{Speed}&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{10}{45} = \\\\frac{2}{9}\\\\ hour&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{2}{9}\\\\times 60 = = \\\\frac{40}{3}\\\\ minutes&s=1$\r\nHence option [C] is correct answer."
