  "question": "Gothenburg Protocol aims to control and reduce emissions of: <ol> <li>Sulphur dioxide</li> <li>Nitrogen oxides</li> <li>Ammonia</li> <li>Volatile organic compounds</li> </ol> Select the correct option from codes given below:",
  "option1": "1, 2 & 3 Only",
  "option2": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option3": "2, 3 & 4 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "The Gothenburg Protocol dates back to 1999 and establishes mandatory emission reductions for four major air pollutants, to be achieved by 2010. It aimed to control and reduces emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ammonia (NH4) &amp; volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The protocol was revised in 2012. The revised protocol specifies emission reduction commitments in terms of percentage reductions from base 2005 to 2020. It has also been extended to cover one additional air pollutant, namely particulate matter (PM2.5), and thereby also black carbon as a component of PM2.5."
