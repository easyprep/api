  "answer": "3 only",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Subansiri Lower Dam project is located on the River Brahmaputra’s tributary, River Subansiri. It is located on the border of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. It is a gravity dam intended for hydroelectric purposes. The dam project has seen many obstacles since inception- geographical obstacles calling for design change, delays due to monsoon flooding, local protests, landslide and earthquake prone nature of the region, etc.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Dibang dam, another gravity dam in the region, is set to hold the title of India’s largest dam. It will also claim the title of World’s tallest dam. This dam is expected to be about 288m tall. This dam is also facing local opposition. The Subansiri project saw revision of dimensions, including height. The review had also called for provisions for dolphins in the region. \n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Subansiri project is a run-of-the-river dam. This type of dams store very little or no water. They are mainly intended for electricity generation. The project is intended to supply 2,000 MW of power when completed. The construction started in 2009 and is about 65% complete. It has been losing 10 crore INR per day due to delays.\n&nbsp;"
