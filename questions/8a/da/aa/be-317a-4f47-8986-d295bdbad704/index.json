Upaveda means applied knowledge and are traditional literatures which contain the subjects of certain technical works. They are as follows: Ayurveda: Deals in Medicine and associated with the Rig-Veda, Dhanurveda: Deals in Archery and associated with the Yajurveda. Vedic Literature consists of Four Vedas, the Brahmanas attached to each Samita, the Aranyakas and the Upanishads."
