  "question": "Consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Amorphous carbon has lesser surface area than activated Charcoal</li>\r\n<li>Charcoal is obtained from Amorphous Carbon by Pyrolysis</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "1 only",
  "option2": "2 only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 only",
  "explanation": "Please note that Charcoal is obtained by slow pyrolysis of wood, sugar etc and not the Amorphous Carbon so statement 2 is incorrect. Amorphous Carbon is pure carbon which is an allotrope of carbon. Charcoal is impure. Amorphous Carbon has lesser surface area because it has some short nanocrystalline structure, so statement 1 is correct"
