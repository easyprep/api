  "answer": "design and synthesis of molecular machines",
  "explanation": "The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2016 was awarded jointly to Jean-Pierre Sauvage, Sir J. Fraser Stoddart and Bernard L. Feringa&nbsp;<em>&quot;</em>for their work on molecular-sized machinery. The major aim behind this contribution is to bring the macroscale structures and engineering down to that size of macroscopic world."
