It is herbivorous and feed on eucalyptus leaves mainly. They are arboreal in habit. They are noted for their sedentary and asocial nature.\r\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe Koala is listed as a vulnerable species by the IUCN. They are native to Australia. They are threatened mainly by habitat loss- speeded up recently by the Australian bush fires. They are also threatened by pathogenic infections of Chlamydia and Koala Retrovirus."
