  "question": "Consider the following statements:<br> 1. Both Mitakshara and Dayabhaga are ancient Indian legal texts<br> 2. Both Jimutvahana and Vijnaneshwara were prominent Jurists of ancient India<br> Which among the above is / are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "In this question, both statements are correct. Mitakshara is a legal commentary on the Yajnavalkya Smriti by Vijnaneshwara. This treatise is best known for theory of &#8220;inheritance by birth.&#8221; Vijnaneshwara was a prominent jurist and scholar in the court of Western Chalukyas. We note here that both Mitakshara and Dayabhaga are considered main authorities on Hindu Law from the time the British began administering laws in India. Dayabhaga was magnum opus of Jimutvahana, a scholar of medieval times."
