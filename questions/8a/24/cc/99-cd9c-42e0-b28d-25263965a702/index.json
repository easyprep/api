  "option1": "Bulgaria",
  "option2": "Greece",
  "option3": "Romania",
  "option4": "Albania",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Greece",
  "explanation": "Greece was the location of the \"Epirus Revolt of 1854\". The 1854 revolt in Epirus was one of the most important of a series of Greek uprisings that occurred in the Ottoman-occupied Greek world during that period. When the Crimean War (1854â€“1856) broke out, many Epirote Greeks, with tacit support from the Greek state, revolted against the Ottoman rule. Although this movement was supported by distinguished military personalities, the correlation of forces doomed it from the start, leading to its suppression after a few months.",
