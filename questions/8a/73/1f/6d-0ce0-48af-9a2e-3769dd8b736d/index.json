  "question": "Consider the following statements with respect to gas hydrates. Which of the following is true? 1.Gas hydrates are also known as Clathrate hydrates. 2.They are crystalline water-based solids physically resembling ice. 3.Methane hydrate is more thermodynamically stable than carbon dioxide hydrate.",
  "option1": "1 only",
  "option2": "1,2 and 3",
  "option3": "2 and 3",
  "option4": "1 and 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1,2 and 3",
  "explanation": "Gas hydrates are clathrate compounds in which the host molecule is water and the guest molecule is typically a gas or liquid. Methane hydrate is less thermodynamically stable than carbon dioxide hydrate."
