  "question": "Recently, the government announced for setting up Methanol Economy Fund (MEF) to promote methanol as an alternative fuel in the country. In this context, consider the following statements: <ol> <li>Methanol is a colourless liquid that has no discernable odour</li> <li>It has low amount of formaldehyde emissions</li> <li>The proposed MEF will be used to set up coal based methanol producing plants</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 & 3 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "None",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 & 3 Only",
  "explanation": "<em>First and third statements are correct.</em> <em>Second statement is incorrect</em>. One of the major disadvantages of methanol is that though Methanol emissions are safer than that of gasoline, it has a high amount of formaldehyde emissions. Methanol is a colourless liquid that has no discernable odour and is made from natural gas, coal, or even from biomass. It is also known as wood alcohol. Government has recently announced that very soon it will be coming up with a policy that mandates for 15% blending of methanol in petrol to make it cheaper and also reduce pollution. Also it has announced its plans to set up a Methanol Economy Fund under the Niti Aayog. Initial corpus of the fund will be Rs 4,000-5,000 crore. The proposed MEF will be used for generation of methanol fuel by converting high ash content coal."
