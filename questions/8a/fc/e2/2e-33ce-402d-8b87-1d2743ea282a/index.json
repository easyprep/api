It is a voluntary organisation constituted in 2011 and it seeks to gradually phase-out the manufacture and use of lead based paints. Kenya, USA, Thailand, Colombia, etc. are some of the members.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Lead Paint Alliance seeks to achieve legally binding laws that govern the lead concentration in paints in all the member nations by 2020.
