  "answer": "China",
  "explanation": "Chinese scientists have developed 'Artificial Transpiration', a new device of 3D hollow-cone structure that can greatly increase the solar-thermal conversion efficiency. 'Artificial Transpiration' device was named by Zhu Jia and his team members in Nanjing University. An article published online by the National Science Review said that, 'Artificial Transpiration' was named so inspired by the transpiration process of trees. It comprises a special 1D water path within it. It can reduce the energy loss in conduction. The cone structure, based on a graphene film, can collect more sunlight throughout the day compared to a flat device. This device can improve solar-thermal conversion rate to 85%. The scientists first applied this structure to solar waste-water treatment.",
