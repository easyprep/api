  "answer": "Mediterranean Sea",
  "explanation": "Strait of Bonifacio is a navigable waterway located in the Mediterranean Sea which separates Corsica Island of France and Sardinia Island of Italy. Thereby, France and Italy form the basin countries of the Strait of Bonifacio. This strait divides the Tyrrhenian Sea from the western Mediterranean Sea. This strait is notorious among sailors for its weather, currents, shoals, and other obstacles. Strait of Bonifacio houses the Lavezzi Archipelago, administrated by France, which is a collection of small granite islands and reefs. France-Italy Maritime Boundary Agreement was signed in 1986 between France and Italy to delimit the maritime boundary between the two countries in the Strait of Bonifacio."
