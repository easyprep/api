  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Tipu Sultan",
  "explanation": "Tipu Sultan used rockets in warfare against the British. The rockets were not perfected, and killed as many of his own soldiers as of British soldiers. So he abandoned the idea of using them. This was in the 1790's- a little after the French Revolution, waaaay before rockets were used in war by Europeans."
