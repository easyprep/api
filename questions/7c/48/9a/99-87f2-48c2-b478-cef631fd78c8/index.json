  "question": "The number of terms in the series 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + …. + 73 + 75 is :",
  "option1": 30,
  "option2": 36,
  "option3": 38,
  "option4": 28,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 38,
  "explanation": "Let the number of terms be n. \r\nIt is an Arithmetic Series whose first term, a = 1 and common difference d = 2.\r\n∴ n<sup>th</sup> term = a + (n - 1) d\r\n$latex => 75 = 1 + (n - 1) 2&s=1$\r\n$latex => 2 (n - 1) = 74&s=1$\r\n$latex => n - 1 = \\\\frac{74}{2} = 37&s=1$\r\n$latex => n = 37 + 1 = 38&s=1$\r\nHence option [C] is the right answer"
