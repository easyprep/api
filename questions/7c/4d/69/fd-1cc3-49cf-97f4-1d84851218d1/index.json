  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Stouffer introduced the concept of intervening opportunities in an attempt to improve upon Zipf's principle of least effort. According to him the actual distance between two places is less important a determinant of migration than the nature of space. He argued that distance should be considered in socio-economic rather than geometric terms. Hence the physical distance was not as important as the number of opportunities available."
