  "question": "Ilmenite, which is widely distributed along the Indian coastal lines is a mineral of __?",
  "option1": "Tungsten",
  "option2": "Titanium",
  "option3": "Gallium",
  "option4": "Tin",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Titanium",
  "explanation": "Ilmenite (FeO.TiO2) is important titanium mineral. It is widely distributed along the Indian coastal lines. With proven reserves exceeding 270 million tonnes, about 37 per cent of the total world Ilmenite reserves are located in the beach sands of the southern peninsular India. Titanium known for its excellent corrosion resistance, high strength and low density, is widely used for aero-engine and airframe structures in both civilian and military aircraft. Titanium-alloy components also find applications in satellite launch vehicles, rockets and missiles. As of now, Indiaâ€™s total titanium requirement is being met by imports even though it possesses a large reserve base of titanium minerals."
