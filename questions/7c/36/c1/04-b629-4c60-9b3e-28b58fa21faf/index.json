  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Painted Grey Ware culture dates back to the Iron Age of India. One of the most noted discoveries from Hastinapur in Meerut of Uttar Pradesh is the ‘Painted Grey Ware’- a new ceramic industry. These represent the relics of early Indo-Aryan people.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Painted Grey Ware culture was succeeded by the Northern Black Polished Ware culture. The PGW culture corresponds to the period of early settlers like Pauravas, Panchalas, etc. who were part of the early Aryan stock in India. The NBPW culture corresponds with the great mahajanapadas states."
