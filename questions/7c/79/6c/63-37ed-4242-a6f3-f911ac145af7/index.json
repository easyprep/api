  "question": "With respect to the recent studies about the exoplanet KELT- 9b, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is an example of ‘hot Jupiter’ exoplanet.</li>\n<li>It is tidally locked to its star.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe KELT- 9b is an example of exoplanets called ‘Hot Jupiters’. These are gas giants that are similar to Jupiter physically but have shorter orbital periods. The KELT- 9b completes an orbit around its star in 1.5 Earth days i.e. its year is 1.5 days long. It’s the hottest known exoplanetary system.\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe KELT- 9b is tidally locked to its star. This means that only one side of the planet faces its star and experiences a perpetual daytime while the other side is always in the dark. The planet is so hot that molecules like hydrogen are ripped apart and reform only after flowing to the far side."
