  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "A member who holds the shares of a company does not imply that the member owns any of the company's assets. This is because assets would be still possessed by the company which is a legal person in itself. However, if the company is wound up, after selling its assets, the shareholder has the right to participate in the assets after the debts have been paid. This means that it is the right to what assets remain after liquidation."
