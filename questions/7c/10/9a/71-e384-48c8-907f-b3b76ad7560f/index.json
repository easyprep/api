  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 Only",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because as per National Youth Policy, 2014, Youth are defined as those aged 15 to 29. <u>Second statement is correct</u> because YDI for India adds a new domain called “social inclusion” to assess the inclusiveness of societal progress. The primary objective of constructing such index is to track the trends in Youth Development across the States. The index enables recognizing the high and low performing states. Besides, the index also measures the priority areas for development of policy and interventions."
