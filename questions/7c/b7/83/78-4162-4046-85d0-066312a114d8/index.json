  "question": "With reference to the changes made to laws governing J&amp;K’s real estates, consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>Non-natives can buy land in Himachal Pradesh without state permission.</li>\n<li>The property rates in J&amp;K are some of the highest in India.</li>\n<li>The Benami Transaction (Prohibition) Act, 2016, helped curb black money in J&amp;K.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?",
  "option1": "2 only",
  "option2": "1 and 3",
  "option3": "1 and 2",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong> Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe state government of HP imposes restriction on real estate sale in the form of Tenancy and Land Reform Act, 1972. The act was passed to safeguard the scarcely available land resource for the locals. It provides that a non-native in HP can buy land only after living there for a minimum period of 30 years. This purchase can occur only with the state government’s permission. This was sought to be relaxed but hasn’t occurred.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nJ&amp;K real estate cannot be brought by outsiders due to the article 370 and 35A provisions which says that a non-native of the state (not a J&amp;K citizen) cannot buy immovable property in the state. Hence the real estate prices have been some of the lowest in India. But with the recent move to scrap these provisions, the prices have been increasing.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Benami Transaction (Prohibition) Amendment act, 2016 did not apply to J&amp;K. It is an amended version of the 1988 act. It helped curb black money menace elsewhere in India but not J&amp;K. This region had its own version called the J&amp;K Benami Transaction (Prohibition) act, 2010. However, the act was not implemented at ground level due to lack of solid rules."
