  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "Convectional rainfall occurs when the air on getting heated becomes light and rises up in convection currents. As the air rises, it expands and drops the temperature and subsequently, condensation takes place and cumulus clouds are formed. Heavy rainfall with lightning and thunder occurs which does not last long. This type of rainfall generally takes place in the equatorial regions and internal parts of the continents, predominantly in the northern hemisphere. This rainfall is usually associated with hail and graupel"
