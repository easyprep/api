  "question": "Which of the following conditions results in the highest density of sea water?",
  "option1": "Depth increases and salinity increases",
  "option2": "Depth decreases and salinity increases",
  "option3": "Depth increases and salinity decreases",
  "option4": "Depth decreases and salinity decreases",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Depth increases and salinity increases",
  "explanation": "The density of surface seawater ranges from about 1020 to 1029 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.It depends on the temperature and salinity. As the depth increases the salinity also increases. At a temperature of 25 °C, salinity of 35 g/kg and 1 atm pressure, the density of seawater is 1023.6 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. Deep in the ocean, under high pressure, seawater can reach a density of 1050 kg/m<sup>3</sup> or higher."
