Morales has been praised for significantly reducing poverty and illiteracy in Bolivia and has been internationally decorated with various awards. On 20 October 2019, Morales won 47.1% of the vote in the first round of the 2019 Bolivian general election. The results were immediately disputed and led to widespread protests across the country. On 9 November 2019 the Organization of American States published a preliminary report that there were \\\"clear manipulations\\\" including physical records with alterations and forged signatures, and evidence of wide-scale data manipulation."
