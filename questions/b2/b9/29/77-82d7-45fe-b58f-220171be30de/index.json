  "question": "Which social networking site has recently banned White Nationalism & Separatism on its Platforms?",
  "option1": "Facebook",
  "option2": "Twitter",
  "option3": "Alphabet",
  "option4": "Tumblr",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Facebook",
  "explanation": "Facebook Inc has recently banned praise, support and representation of white nationalism and  separatism. This move has drawn a qualified approval from New Zealand where a massacre of 50 people in mosques was live streamed in March 2019. The social media giant also pledged to improve its ability to identify and block material from terrorist groups. The ban was a shift in Facebookâ€™s policy after criticism by civil rights groups that it was failing to confront extremism. Now, Facebook users searching for offending terms will be directed to a charity which combats far-right extremism.  White nationalism is a type of nationalism or pan-nationalism which espouses the belief that white people are a race and seeks to develop and maintain a white national identity. On the other hand, White separatism is a separatist political and social movement that seeks the separation of white people from people of other races and ethnicities, the establishment of a white ethnostate by removing non-whites from existing communities or by forming new communities elsewhere."
