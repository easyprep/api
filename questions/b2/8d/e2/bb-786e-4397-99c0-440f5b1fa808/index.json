  "option2": "Gambia",
  "option3": "Guinea",
  "option4": "Ghana",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Gabon",
  "explanation": "Akanda National Park is an IUCN Category II national park and one of 13 National Parks in Gabon set up in 2002. The 13 national parks are designed to represent the biodiversity of the country and encourage tourism. Akanda National Park is located in the northeast of the country, near Libreville, with coastline along the Mondah and Corisco bays. The national park is composed chiefly of mangrove and tidal beach habitats. Gabon has only 2.5% of the total mangrove swamp in Africa, but Akanda together with the nearby Pongara National Park comprises 25% of the total protected mangrove in the continent. They play an important role in the ecosystem and help stabilise the coastline around Libreville. Human encroachment from both building and crop planting is a threat to both parks. Both of the bays are rich in marine life, and Corisco bay provides an important feeding area for turtles. Akanda is internationally important as a site for migratory birds and is home to the largest populations of such birds in Gabon. It is an IUCN Critical Site."
