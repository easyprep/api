  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "In 2017, Ahmedabad in Gujarat was formally accorded the status of India’s first World Heritage City by UNESCO. The Telangana state government decided to construct “eco-bridges” for movement of tigers from tiger corridor linking the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) in the Chandrapur district of Maharashtra with the forests in Telangana. Maharashtra became the first state to provide digitally-signed land record receipts (also known as 7/12 receipts). The 7/12 receipt is the most important document which establishes the ownership of the land and is primarily used by farmers while applying for loans."
