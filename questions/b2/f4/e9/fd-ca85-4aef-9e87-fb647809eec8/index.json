  "question": "Odisha Rasagola is the latest Indian commodity to get GI tagged. Consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>The Geographical Indication of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act deals with GI tagging.</li>\n<li>Geographical Indication registration is valid for a period of 20 years.</li>\n<li>This cancels the GI tag held by the West Bengal rasagulla.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 and 2",
  "option2": "3 only",
  "option3": "2 only",
  "option4": "1 only",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 only",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe Geographical indication of goods (registration and protection) act, passed in 1999 in accordance with the TRIPS directive protects the goods from being sold by unauthorised sellers. TRIPS is Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property rights. It is an international agreement among the WTO members. The rules for the 1999 act were given in 2002.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe GI registration is valid for a period of 10 years. After this, the registration can be renewed. The rights holder can initiate legal action against misuse of the GI tagged product via civil or criminal cases. However, registration is not mandatory for initiating legal action against “passing off” by dishonest commercial dealers.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe rasagola was a point of contention between Odisha and West Bengal. The debate was regarding the actual place of origin of the delicacy. West Bengal got rasagola registered as its GI product in 2017. The tagging of Odisha Rasagola simply differentiates the two as different versions of the delicacy- distinct in texture and taste."
