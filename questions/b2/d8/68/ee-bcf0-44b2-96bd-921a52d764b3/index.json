  "answer": "Typhoid",
  "explanation": "DPT is a class of combination vaccines against three infectious diseases in humans: diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), and tetanus. The vaccine components include diphtheria and tetanus and killed whole cells of the bacterium that causes pertussis. Diptheria is a highly contagious bacterial infection typically affecting the throat and tonsils with the formation of a thick grey membrane over those areas.   Tetanus is bacteria which lives in soil and contaminates wounds, where it produces a powerful toxin, the toxin attacks the nervous system causing increasing muscle spasm and rigidity. Whooping Cough is one of the most contagious bacterial infections known. Beginning with a runny nose and sore throat, it progresses to a severe spasmodic cough which persists for around 3 months."
