  "question": "What is the relation between mass and wavelength of any matter, as per de Broglie's relation?",
  "option1": "Both are directly proportional",
  "option2": "Both are inversely proportional",
  "option3": "Both are independent of each other",
  "option4": "wavelength is twice the square of the mass",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both are inversely proportional",
  "explanation": "According to de Broglie, every object in motion has a wave character. As per de Broglie's relation, mass and wavelength are inversely proportional to each other."
