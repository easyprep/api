  "question": "What is the work done by centripetal force in case of Uniform Circular Motion?",
  "option1": "1 joule",
  "option2": "0 joule",
  "option3": "Depends on the magnitude of Force",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "0 joule",
  "explanation": "The work done by Centripetal Force in case of Uniform Circular Motion is zero. The displacement and force are mutually perpendicular to each other in case of centripetal force. Therefore the work done is zero."
