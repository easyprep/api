  "explanation": "• Water glass is also called sodium silicate or soluble glass. It is a compound containing sodium oxide that forms a glassy solid with the very useful property of being soluble in water.<br />• The head of safety matches are made of an oxidizing agent such as potassium chlorate, mixed with sulfur, fillers and glass powder.<br />• Potassium sulphate is straight potassic fertiliser which is chloride free and has low salt index. It is also known as fertilizer for improving quality and is applied to crops in open field as well as under protected cultivation.<br />• Sodium chloride commonly known as salt is an ionic compound with the chemical formula NaCl, representing a 1:1 ratio of sodium and chloride ions."
