  "explanation": "A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for online ticketing of National Museum of Indian Cinema (NMIC) was inked between Films Division and BookMyShow (BMS) in New Delhi. With this MoU, booking a ticket to visit NMIC will be a click away as it will now be available on BookMyShow, thus benefiting film lovers in India and abroad. The MoU has been part of Museum outreach initiatives aimed at increasing footfalls to NMIC. It is the only museum in India dedicated to cinema and is an institution of national importance. The Museum was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier in January 2019, at Films Division complex, Mumbai, Maharashtra. It showcases history of India Cinema with help of rare artefacts, diorama, properties and digital elements including costumes, interactive digital screens, information based screen interfaces, kiosks, among others."
