  "option4": "Ganga River and Yamuna River",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Saraswati river and Drsadvati River",
  "explanation": "The earliest of the Hindu sacred text, Rig-veda refers to the Saprasindhava, Panchanada, Madhydesa and Praki. These were perhaps the first references to the emergence of regions. The geographical location of these regions suggests that the Indo- Aryans preferred to settle down along the banks of the rivers-Sindhu (Indus), Vitasta, Jhelum), Asikni also known Chandrabhaga (Chenab). References are also found to Airavati (Ravn. Parushuni or Vipasa (Dcas), Saradru (Saduj) and the Saraswati. There is a general agreement that the region known as Panchanada included the plains of the five great eastern tributaries of the Sindhu river. Further east, the land between the Saraswati and Drishadvati was known to the IndoAryans as Brahmavarta. On the periphery of these plains lie the alluvial basins of the Gomti (Gomal), Krumu (Kurrum) and Kubha (Kabul). It is believed that these were the earliest Indo-Aryan settlements. Literary evidence suggests eastward march of the Indo-Aryans led to their settlements to the Madhyadesa regions.
