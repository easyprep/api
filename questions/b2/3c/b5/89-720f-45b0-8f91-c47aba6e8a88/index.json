  "option1": "Both U-235 and U-238 are fissile but only U-235 can sustain chain reactions",
  "option2": "Only U-235 is fissile and can sustain chain reaction but U-238 is fertile",
  "option3": "U-238 can be used in chain reactions only after extracting U-235 from it",
  "option4": "Uranium enrichment is a process where concentration of U-238 is increased using some chemical processes",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only U-235 is fissile and can sustain chain reaction but U-238 is fertile",
  "explanation": "<p class=\\\"answer\\\"><span style=\\\"font-size: 13.5pt; color: black;\\\">C is not correct because U-238 will support chain reactions after it is converted to plutonium-239. D is also incorrect because its concentration of U-235 that matters."
