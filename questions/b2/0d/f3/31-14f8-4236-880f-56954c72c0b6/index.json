  "question": "Which of these hybridization is found in Phosphorus pentachloride molecule?",
  "option1": "sp",
  "option2": "sp<sub>2</sub>",
  "option3": "sp<sub>3</sub>",
  "option4": "sp<sub>2</sub>d",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "sp<sub>2</sub>d",
  "explanation": "The Phosphorus pentachloride molecule formed due to sp<sub>2</sub>d hybridisation. It has a trigonal bipyramidal geometry. Three P–Cl bonds (equatorial) make an angle of 120º with each other and lie in one plane."
