  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nDisruptive models are those that supersede an earlier model. These are usually of superior attributes. Such models tend to create disruption in conventional business establishments and even large scale losses to conventional business entities. In the long run, however, it will bring in an evolved form of the business.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe KPMG report listed e-commerce as the most disruptive business model. E-commerce platforms like Amazon tend to disrupt the business of normal brick and mortar establishments. The next most disruptive business model listed was social networking. The report named Amazon, Apple and Alibaba as the most disruptive companies."
