  "question": "Quartz is one of the most important minerals used in electronics. With this reference, consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Quartz is one of the several piezoelectric minerals</li>\r\n<li>Quartz is strongly pyroelectric</li>\r\n<li>Quartz has a specific crystalline form</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Quartz is transparent, tough, has a constant chemical composition and has a specific crystalline form (hexagonal). These are some of the reasons but the important reasons are its properties of piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity. These two properties make quartz versatile in electronic devices. Quartz is one of several piezoelectric minerals; when pressure is applied to the mineral, a positive electrical charge is created at one end of the crystal and a negative electric charge at the other end. Quartz is also strongly pyroelectric; temperature changes create positive and negative charges within the crystal."
