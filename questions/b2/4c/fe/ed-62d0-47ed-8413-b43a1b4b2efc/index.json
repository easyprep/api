  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "Recently, in August 2017, Gobindobhog rice, a speciality from Burdwan district of West Bengal, has got the geographical indication (GI) status. This variety of rice is primarily cultivated in east Burdwan district - in the southern basin of the Damodar River in the Raina 1, Raina 2 and Khandaghosh blocks. The south Damodar belt has been the traditional area of Gobindobhog rice cultivation. The rice has several advantages. It is cultivated late and therefore not much affected by rains. It is less prone to pests as well.  In March 2017, Assam's aromatic Joha rice has received the GI (geographical indications) tag from the Union ministry of commerce. Joha rice is short-grained rice belonging to a distinct class of aromatic rice. It is only grown in the Northeast region of India. Because of the polyphenolic and flavonoids constituent of this rice, it has high anti-oxidant properties. Kalanamak rice is a tiny pearl like rice variety traditionally being grown in Uttar Pradesh. It is known for its aroma and distinct taste; it has now been awarded the Geographical Indication (GI) tag in September 2013."
