  "option1": "Ma'asir-i-Alamgiri",
  "option2": "Alamgirnama",
  "option3": "Futuhat-i-Almgiri",
  "option4": "Muntakhab-ul-Lubab",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Alamgirnama",
  "explanation": "Muhammad Qazim was appointed Munshi by Aurangzeb in the first year of his reign and was later on commissioned by the emperor to complete the annals of his reign. After the eleventh year, up to which point Muhammad Qazim recorded his history, Aurangzeb forbade its continuation. On the manuscript being shown to Aurangzeb, he withdrew his permission for the preparation of this official history. Alamgirnama is a good detailed history of the first ten years of Aurangzeb's reign from 1658 to 1668."
