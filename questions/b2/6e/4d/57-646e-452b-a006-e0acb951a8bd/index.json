  "question": "Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which sometimes seen in news, is associated to which of the following organizations?",
  "option1": "CERN",
  "option2": "ISRO",
  "option3": "NASA",
  "option4": "JAXA",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "CERN",
  "explanation": "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world\\'s largest and most powerful particle collider and the largest machine in the world.  It is in news because The European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) has approved the experiment designed to look for light and weakly interacting particles at the LHC.  It is planning a new experiment to look for particles associated with the mysterious dark matter which makes up about 27% of the universe. This novel experiment will help diversify the physics programme of colliders such as the LHC, and will allow the researchers to address unanswered questions in particle physics from a different perspective. FASER (or the Forward Search Experiment) will complement CERNâ€™s ongoing physics programme & extend its discovery potential to several new particles. The FASER detector\\'s total length is under 5m and its core cylindrical structure has a radius of 10cm. It will be installed in a side tunnel along an unused transfer line which links the LHC to its injector, the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). A collaboration of 16 institutes is building the detector and will carry out the experiments which will start taking data from LHC between 2021 and 2023. LHC is a giant lab in a 27-kilometre tunnel straddling the French-Swiss border. India is an associate member in the LHC project."
