  "question": "The camel breeding sector of Rajasthan has been in news recently. In this context, consider the following:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Export of camels from Rajasthan to other states is prohibited.</li>\n<li>Camel milk cannot be monetised in the state.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe export of camels from Rajasthan to other states is prohibited. The export to foreign countries is also prohibited. This is in accordance with the Rajasthan Camel (Prohibition of Slaughter and Regulation of Temporary Migration or Export) Bill of 2015. The transport of camels outside the state is punishable with a prison term of 1 to 5 years and also has provisions for a fine.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nEarlier, the local communities did not monetise the camel milk as it was considered a ‘gift of god’. They only exchanged it. However, with the increasing burden of camel crisis and dropping camel prices, they have resorted to trading of the milk."
