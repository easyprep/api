  "question": "What is the Gibbs energy of a cell (nF=amount of charge passed, E= EMF of the cell)?",
  "option1": "-1/2nFE",
  "option2": "2nFE",
  "option3": "-nFE",
  "option4": "nFE",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "-nFE",
  "explanation": "If the emf of the cell is E and nF is the amount of charge passed and âˆ†rG is the Gibbs energy of the reaction, then Gibbs energy is equal to - nFE."
