  "explanation": "According to RBI’s Financial Stability Report (FSR) June 2017, India\\'s economic growth rate has forecasted at 7.3% in terms of Gross Value Added (GVA) in the current fiscal year FY 2017-18. The report projected CPI inflation to be in the range of 2-3.5% in the first half of the year and 3.5-4.5% in the second half. It stated that Retail inflation, excluding food and fuel that remained sticky during H2 of FY17 at around 4.9%, dipped to 4.3% in April and 4.2% in May 2017, largely reflecting the impact of decline in global crude oil prices on transport and communication and moderate price pressures in services.  The FSR reflects the overall assessment on the stability of India’s financial system and its resilience to risks emanating from global and domestic factors."
