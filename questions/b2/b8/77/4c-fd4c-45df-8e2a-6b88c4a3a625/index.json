  "question": "With reference to the ongoing discussions to deal with desertification, consider the following statements Gujarat’s Banni Grasslands:<br />\n<ol>\n<li><em>Prosopis juliflora</em> introduction is a cause of Banni Grassland’s degradation.</li>\n<li>When cattle feed on metabolic reserve part of the grassland, desertification occurs.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:<strong> </strong>",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe <em>Prosopis julliflora</em> is a non-native species that was introduced in these grasslands by the Planning Commission. This was to tackle salinity and expansion of the Rann of Kutch. However, the plants are invasive and water intensive. They have led to disappearance of native plants and consequently land degradation.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nOvergrazing is a major cause of desertification. These grasslands have supported cattle like the Banni cattle for years. However, the grass grows back only if the cattle feed on the epical reserve part and leave out the metabolic part of the grasses.\n&nbsp;"
