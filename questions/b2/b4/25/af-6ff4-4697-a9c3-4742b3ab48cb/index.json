  "question": "Which of the following states of matter has the weakest Intermolecular forces?",
  "option1": "Solids",
  "option2": "Liquids",
  "option3": "Gases",
  "option4": "It is same in solids, liquids and gases",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Gases",
  "explanation": "The three states of matter varies from each other due to the following factors. (1) The different magnitudes of the interatomic and intermolecular forces. (2) The extent of random thermal motion of atoms and molecules of a substance (which depends upon temperature). The Intermolecular force is strongest in solids and weakest in gases."
