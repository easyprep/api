  "option1": "J.S. Mill",
  "option2": "Jeremy Bentham",
  "option3": "L.T. Hobhouse",
  "option4": "T.H. Green",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "J.S. Mill",
  "explanation": "J.S.

Mill maintained that some pleasures were qualitatively superior to others and quality of pleasure was no less important than its quantity."
