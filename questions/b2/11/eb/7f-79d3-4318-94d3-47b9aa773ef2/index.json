  "question": "If two persons A and B works 7 hours a day, then A and B alone can complete a piece of work in 6 days and 8 days respectively. While working 8 hours a day, in what time they would complete it together?",
  "option1": "2.5 days",
  "option2": "3 days",
  "option3": "4 days",
  "option4": "3.6 days",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "3 days",
  "explanation": "A alone can complete the work in 42 days working 1 hour daily. Similiarly, B will take 56 days working 1 hour daily. \r\nA\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{42}&s=1$\r\nB\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{56}&s=1$\r\n(A + B)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{42}+\\\\frac{1}{56} = \\\\frac{4+3}{168} = \\\\frac{7}{168}&s=1$\r\nâˆ´ Time taken by (A + B) working 8 hours daily $latex = \\\\frac{168}{7\\\\times 8} =&s=1$ 3 days\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer."
