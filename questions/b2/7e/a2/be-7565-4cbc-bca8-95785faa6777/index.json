  "question": "Which among the following is the horizon from which the minerals of aluminium and iron and other minerals are removed because of percolation of water downwards?",
  "option1": "Parent rock horizon",
  "option2": "Eluviated horizon",
  "option3": "Iluviated horizon",
  "option4": "Sub stratum",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Eluviated horizon",
  "explanation": "The process of removal of minerals from soil horizon is called Eluviation. Eluviated layer (E) in the soil profile exists below the A layer and the minerals are eluviated because of percolation of water downwards which forms Iluviated layer (B) below the E layer. E layer is comparatively lighter in colour compared to A and B layers."
