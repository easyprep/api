  "question": "The model of the atomic structure in which an atom resembled the solar system?",
  "option1": "Rutherford",
  "option2": "JJ Thomson",
  "option3": "Goldstein",
  "option4": "Millikan",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Rutherford",
  "explanation": "Rutherford conducted α-ray scattering experiment. He made these observations and conclusions: <br> 1. Most of the α-particles passed straight through the gold foil without any deflection. This indicated presence of large empty space in an atom <br>2. Very few α-particles completely rebounded and few α-particles showed large deflection. This indicated presence of a central, positively charged core known as nucleus. <br>So, Rutherford concluded that atom is mostly composed of empty space. The entire positive charge and mass of the atom is concentrated in the small, central part known as the nucleus. The size of the nucleus is so small that its diameter is 10<sup>5</sup> times less than that of the atom. The diameter of the nucleus has been estimated by Rutherford as 10<sup>–13</sup>cm in contrast to that of the atom to be 10<sup>–8</sup> cm. The electrons present outside the nucleus revolve round the nucleus with high velocities. The electrons revolve round the nucleus with high velocities to counterbalance the electrostatic forces of attraction between protons and electrons. Rutherford’s atomic model resembles the planetary motion in solar system so is also called planetary model."
