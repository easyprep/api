The app was developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) of the Himachal Pradesh government. It would be available in both Hindi and English languages and would not require internet connectivity. The app, once triggered, would automatically send a message to the nearest police control room and start recording audio and video after 20 seconds. The state government has also launched the \\'GUDDIYA\\' helpline number 1515 and the \\'Hoshiyar Singh\\' helpline number 1090. The app and the helpline were part of an initiative to fight crimes against women in the state. The \\'Hoshiyar Singh\\' helpline would be monitored by the CM\\'s office in a 24x7 basis, and the government would use information gathered on this helpline to come down heavily on the drug, forest and mining mafias."
