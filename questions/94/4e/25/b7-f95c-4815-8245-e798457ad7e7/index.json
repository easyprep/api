  "question": "Which of the following is / are correct statements about the cosmic rays?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>They are made of charged particles</li>\r\n<li>They are received on earth mainly from Sun</li>\r\n<li>They cause Ozone Depletion</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1",
  "option4": "None of them",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "Cosmic Rays are made up of positively and negatively charged particles. Cosmic rays may broadly be divided into two categories: primary and secondary. The cosmic rays that originate from astrophysical sources are primary cosmic rays; these primary cosmic rays interact with interstellar matter creating secondary cosmic rays. Sun is not the major source but is a minor source. The Sun also emits low energy cosmic rays associated with solar flares. The third statement is correct. The chain of reactions in the upper atmosphere due to the cosmic rays causes depletion of the ozone but this depletion is small in comparison to the depletion caused by CFCs."
