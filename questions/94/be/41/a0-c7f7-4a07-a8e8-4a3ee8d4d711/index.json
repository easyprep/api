  "question": "With reference to the blueprint unveiled for the major structural reforms of the armed force, by the Army Chief, consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>The armed force is to see its first Integrated Battle Group.</li>\n<li>Shekatkar committee recommends methods to restructure the field army.</li>\n<li>The army will be reduced by implementation of the blueprint.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below<strong>: </strong>",
  "option1": "1 and 3",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 and 2",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe blueprint was formed after commission of four studies, the purposes of which were: army HQ restructure, army restructure, cadre review of officers and review of terms and conditions of junior commission officers. The Integrated Battle Group is a concept from the army restructure study. These are agile and self-sufficient brigades- formed on basis of “treat, terrain and task”. Brigade is a unit of a corp (largest mobile formation of Army). The IBG can mobilise in 12 to 48 hours.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Shekatkar committee was commissioned by the defence ministry. It sought to study ways to increase combat capability and cost efficiency. It mainly targeted the support structure of the army. The current blueprint targets the field army structure. It seeks to integrate modernisation of the force, along with optimisation of the budget and improved operational efficiency.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe implementation of the restructuring concept will reduce the army from the current 1.3 million. The Indian army is the second largest in the world after Chinese PLA. Most of the defence budget goes into salaries and pensions. This leaves little for hardware procurement and upgradation. This is important given the evolution of hybrid warfare. However, the reduced numbers will be reabsorbed into new risings in the pipeline.\n&nbsp;"
