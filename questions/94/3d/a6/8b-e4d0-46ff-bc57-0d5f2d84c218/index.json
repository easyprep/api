  "explanation": "The Zero Discrimination Day (ZDD) is observed every year on March 1 to promote the idea that everyone has a right to live with dignity. The day is also meant to highlight how everyone can be part of the transformation and take a stand towards a fair and just society. It recognizes that no one should ever be discriminated against because of their age, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, race, ethnicity, language, health (including HIV) status, geographical location, economic status or migrant status, or for any other reason. This year (2018), the Zero Discrimination Day campaign invites people to ask themselves “What if …” and to reflect upon their own actions."
