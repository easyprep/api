  "question": "A sailor goes 12 km downstream in 48 minutes and returns in 1 hour 20 minutes. The speed of the sailor in still water is :",
  "option1": "12 km/hr",
  "option2": "12.5 km/hr",
  "option3": "13 km/hr",
  "option4": "15 km/hr",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "12 km/hr",
  "explanation": "Let the speed of sailor in still water be x km/hr and speed of current y km/hr.\r\n$latex \\\\therefore x+y = \\\\frac{12}{\\\\frac{48}{60}} = \\\\frac{12}{48}\\\\times 60 = 15 km/hr&s=1$\r\n$latex and \\\\: x-y = \\\\frac{12}{\\\\frac{80}{60}} = \\\\frac{12\\\\times 60}{80} = 9 kmph&s=1$\r\nAdding these equations,\r\n$latex 2x = 15+9 = 24$\r\n$latex => x = 12km/hr$\r\nHence option [A] is correct answer"
