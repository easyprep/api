  "question": "The HCF and LCM of two numbers are 12 and 336 respectively. If one of the number is 84, the other is :",
  "option1": 48,
  "option2": 36,
  "option3": 96,
  "option4": 76,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 48,
  "explanation": "First Number $latex \\\\times$ Second Number = HCF $latex \\\\times$ LCM\r\n=> 84 $latex \\\\times$ second number  = 12 $latex \\\\times$ 336\r\nSince second number = $latex \\\\frac{12\\\\times 336}{84} = 48&s=1$\r\nHence option [A] is the right answer."
