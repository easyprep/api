  "question": "Taiga is located at southern latitudes than Tundra, still the extreme minimum temperatures have been recorded in Taiga. What is / are the reasons behind the same?",
  "option1": "Because winters of Taiga get colder due to Polar winds",
  "option2": "Because Tundra is near to Arctic Ocean",
  "option3": "Because Taiga has clearer skies in comparison to Tundra",
  "option4": "All of above reasons.",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Because Tundra is near to Arctic Ocean",
  "explanation": "<ch^><table width=\"100%\"> <tbody> <tr> <td width=\"100%\">In the above question, the correct answer is B. In winter, there are long periods of frozen Ice on Polar Tundra, yet the Arctic Ocean contains enough heat to tweak the temperature a little bit. This is the reason that lowest reliably recorded temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere were recorded in the taiga of northeastern Russia.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table><ph^>"
