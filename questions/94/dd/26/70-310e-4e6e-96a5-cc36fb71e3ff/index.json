  "question": "There are two groups A and B of a class, consisting of 42 and 28 students respectively. If the average weight of group A is 25 kg and that of group B is 40 kg, find the average weight of whole class?",
  "option1": "30 kg",
  "option2": "31 kg",
  "option3": "42 kg",
  "option4": "45 kg",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "31 kg",
  "explanation": "Average weight of both groups = \r\n$latex = \\\\frac{42\\\\times25 + 28\\\\times 40}{42+28}&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{1050 + 1120}{70} = \\\\frac{2170}{70} = 31 kg.&s=1$\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer."
