  "option3": "They get deflected to the right in Northern Hemisphere and to the left in Southern Hemisphere due to Coriolis effect",
  "option4": "These winds converge near equator & form the ITCZ",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "They are seasonal winds which change their direction periodically with the change in season.",
  "explanation": "Trade winds are planetary or permanent winds which are extremely steady blowing from sub-tropical high pressure areas (30 degree N and S) towards the equatorial low pressure belt. They get deflected to the right in Northern Hemisphere and to the left in Southern Hemisphere due to Coriolis effect and Ferrelâ€™s law. These winds converge near the equator an form the ITCZ."
