  "explanation": "At Bhimbaithaka, most painted caves are of Mesolithic age. The importance of these caves is that here lived the men collectively and the tools and weapons made by them for use are still intact. Mostly the paintings are of red and white colour while some were green and yellow colour also. These colours were prepared by the local pigments found in earth. These colours were mixed with water or some other liquid. Most of the paintings have been destroyed by forces of nature. But even then lot of good paintings are still there in good condition which are painted on the roof and walls these caves. These paintings can be divided into four ages.\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Mesolithic age</li>\r\n<li>Copper stone age</li>\r\n<li>Early Historic age</li>\r\n<li>Later Historic age</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThe paintings are mostly of Mesolithic age, in which deer and stag are most painted. The elephant, rhinoceros, bear, wild bear, cow bullock, buck, deer, and monkeys etc. have also been painted. Al so there is Fish, tortoise and crabs. There are some social themes, also, in which dance dresses; ornaments, mother and child, drinking party, hunting scene and folk dance etc. are painted. Later paintings are of processions on horses. In these paintings, the primitive hunter man depicted with bow and arrow, has not only successfully expressed his emotions but also the mysterious nature and his struggle for existence against the ferocious animals of the jungle"
