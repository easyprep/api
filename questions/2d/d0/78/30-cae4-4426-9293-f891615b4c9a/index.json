  "question": "On which among the following, the thickness of the Ozone layer depends in earthâ€™s atmosphere?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Latitude</li>\r\n<li>Seasons</li>\r\n<li>Longitudes</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The thickness of the ozone layer-that is, the total amount of ozone in a column overhead-varies by a large factor worldwide, being in general smaller near the equator and larger towards the poles. It also varies with season, being in general thicker during the spring and thinner during the autumn in the northern hemisphere. The reasons for this latitude and seasonal dependence are complicated, involving atmospheric circulation patterns as well as solar intensity."
