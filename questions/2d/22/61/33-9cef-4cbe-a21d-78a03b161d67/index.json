  "question": "In context with the recent observations about ‘Jellyfish Galaxies’, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>These are formed by collision of 2 galaxies.</li>\n<li>Star formation does not take place in the ‘tentacles’ of the jellyfish galaxies.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nRecently, the jellyfish galaxy, JW100 was observed and studied using the Astrosat’s instruments. These are galaxies formed by collision of disc shaped galaxy with a dense galactic clusters. This is because the cluster’s gravity attracts the disc galaxy towards it.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe jellyfish galaxy has a disc shaped structure with many tentacles streaming away from it. The star formation occurs both in the disc and tentacle regions. These galaxies have hostile environment. X-ray emitting hot plasma occur in these bodies."
