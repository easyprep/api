  "answer": "Uttar Pradesh",
  "explanation": "The Uttar Pradesh government has recently launched a free household power connection scheme 'Prakash hai to vikas hai' for the poor in the state to mark former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's birthday. Initially, the two village Lohban and Gausana of Mathura district have been covered for 100% electrification. Under this scheme, the state government has a target of covering 16 million by the end of 2018. Apart from this, the UP government has also introduced Kisan Uday Yojana, scheme for farmers in which existing 5 HP/7.5 HP submersible and coupling sets of farmers will be replaced free of cost. The scheme, which would cover 10 lakh farmers by 2022, would lead to 35% saving on power consumption.",
