  "explanation": "The Union Information and Broadcasting Ministry has planned to set up a \\'Social Media Communication Hub\\' that would help it keep a tab on trending news in districts and gather feedback on the Centre\\'s flagship schemes. Under the project, media persons would be employed on contractual basis in each district to be the eyes and ears of the government and provide real-time updates from the ground. They would also take the people\\'s feedback on the government\\'s policies and follow the news trending in their areas. Experts would also be employed at the central level to analyse the feedback. Recently, the Broadcast Engineering Consultants India Limited (BECIL), a Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) under the ministry, had floated a tender to supply a software for the project. The tender document stated the platform is expected to provide automated reports, tactical insights and comprehensive work-flows to initiate engagement across digital channels."
