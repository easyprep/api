  "question": "Which country houses the \"Porkkala Peninsula\"?",
  "option1": "Canada",
  "option2": "Ireland",
  "option3": "Finland",
  "option4": "Georgia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Finland",
  "explanation": "Porkkala Peninsula, also known as Porkkalanniemi, is a peninsula located in the Gulf of Finland, located in Southern Finland. This peninsula had great strategic value, as coastal artillery based there would be able to shoot more than halfway across the Gulf of Finland. If the same power controlled the Estonian coast on the opposite side of the gulf, it would then be able to block Russia's Saint Petersburg's naval access to the Baltic Sea. If there will be a foreign power base in the peninsula, then it would be able to exert significant pressure on the Finnish government."
