  "question": "With reference to the recent government directives on the use of ‘Membrane-based Water Purification System’, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Reverse Osmosis based water filtration also belongs to this category of filtration system.</li>\n<li>If the government proposal is made into a law, the use of MWPS will be prohibited in homes.</li>\n<li>The BIS accepted upper limit for total dissolved solids in water is 2,000mg/l.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option4": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nMWPS use a semi-permeable membrane to remove solids and other impurities from the water. Reverse osmosis also makes use of membranes to filter water. The National Green Tribunal had banned the use of reverse osmosis purifiers as they waste water and also strip the water off essential salts. \n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:       </strong>\nThe union environment ministry had published the draft of a directive that bans the use of MWPS in homes (point of use) which receive their water supply from a source that meets the BIS standards. The water source also qualifies if its subject to flocculation, filtration and disinfection.\n<strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:   </strong>\nThe Bureau of Indian Standards had given the accepted upper limit for total dissolved solids (TDS) in water to be 500 to 1,200 mg/l. It has no lower limit for the same. The TDS in water is composed of various salts and may even contain some organic matter.\n&nbsp;"
