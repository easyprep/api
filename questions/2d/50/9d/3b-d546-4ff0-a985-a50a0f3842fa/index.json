  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Indian Sign Language is not recognised as one of the official languages of the government. The language is being promoted by the Indian Sign language Research and Training Centre. The current project will add 4,000 new words to the dictionary.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe main issue facing the widespread use of the language is its insufficient spread to rural population. The new project will incorporate words from the agriculture category. Apart from this, the dictionary will also get words from the legal, medical, education and administration sector."
