There are five major types of writs viz. habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari. Each of them has different meaning and different implications.\r\nIn India, both Supreme Court and High Court have been empowered with Writ Jurisdiction. Further, Parliament by law can extendÂ power to issue writs to any other courts (including local courts) for local limits of jurisdiction of such courts"
