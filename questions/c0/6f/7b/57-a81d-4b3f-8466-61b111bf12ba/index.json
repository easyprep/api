  "answer": "Manipur",
  "explanation": "The Tipaimukh Dam is a proposed embankment dam on the river Barak in Manipur, which was first commissioned in 1983. The purpose of the dam is flood control and hydroelectric power generation. It has been subject to repeated delays as the project developed, as there has been controversy between India and Bangladesh over water rights, in addition to questions of environmental effects of the huge project, as well as the need to relocate Meitei people to make way for a vast reservoir. In 2013, both the governments announced up to a 2-year delay, to allow Bangladesh to complete additional environmental studies."
