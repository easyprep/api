  "question": "If A and B together can complete a work in 12 days, B and C together in 15 days and C and A together in",
  "option1": "20 days",
  "option2": "24 days",
  "option3": "25 days",
  "option4": "30 days",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "20 days",
  "explanation": "(A + B)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{12}&s=1$\r\n(B + C)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{15}&s=1$\r\n(C + A)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{20}&s=1$\r\nOn adding all above equations, \r\n2(A + B + C)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{12}+\\\\frac{1}{15}+\\\\frac{1}{20}&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{5+4+3}{60} = \\\\frac{1}{5}&s=1$\r\n∴ (A + B + C)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{10}&s=1$\r\n∴ B\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{10}-\\\\frac{1}{20} = \\\\frac{2-1}{20} = \\\\frac{1}{20}&s=1$\r\n∴ B alone can do the work in 20 days. \r\nHence option [A] is correct answer."
