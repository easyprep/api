  "question": "Which of the following techniques is used to transmit audio signals in television broadcasts?",
  "option1": "Amplitude Modulation",
  "option2": "Frequency Modulation",
  "option3": "Pulse Code Modulation",
  "option4": "Time Division Multiplexing",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Frequency Modulation",
  "explanation": "Frequency modulation is a process in which the frequency of the carrier is varied in accordance with the instantaneous value of modulating voltage. In telecommunications and signal processing, frequency modulation (FM) conveys information over a carrier wave by varying its instantaneous frequency. FM is most commonly used for radio and television broadcasting."
