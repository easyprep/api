  "question": "In context of the recent news coverage of the ‘Light Blade’ defence system, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It was introduced by Iran.</li>\r\n<li>It is based on laser technology.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe ‘Light Blade’ defence system was recently announced by the Israeli defence ministry. The announcement came in light of the recent tensions between Iran and USA and the threats to attack Israel from Iran. Israel is a noted ally of the USA.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe ‘Light Blade’ system is to be based on laser technology. The laser is to make use of electricity and hence will reduce the need for munition. It is a long range defence system, to be developed to complement the short range Iron Dome system and medium range David’s Sling system."
