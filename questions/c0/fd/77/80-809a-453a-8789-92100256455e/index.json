  "answer": "China",
  "explanation": "As per Amnesty International Global Report ‘Death Sentences & Executions 2016’, China has executed most people in 2016, despite the number of executions worldwide dropped by 37%.  The report stated that it is difficult to get a clear number as Beijing classifies most information related to the death penalty as \\\"state secrets\\\".  The agency said it believes that China executed thousands each year. Excluding China, states around the world executed 1,032 people in 2016, according to Amnesty\\'s records. Iran has acquired 2nd position followed by Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Pakistan and Egypt. The report further stated that 104 countries were recorded to have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. Amnesty collects its statistics using official figures, media reports and information passed on from individuals sentenced to death and their families and representatives."
