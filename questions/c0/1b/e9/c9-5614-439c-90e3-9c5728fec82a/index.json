With the defeat of the Ottomans in World War I, an outcry to save the Khalifa and Caliphate emerged across the Muslim world, including in India. A number of Muslim leaders including Maulana Muhammad Ali, his brother, Maulana Shaukat Ali, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad came together to form the All India Khilafat Committee. They published the Khilafat Manifesto in 1920 calling upon the British to protect the caliphate, and exhorting the Indian Muslims to unite and hold the British accountable on that count."
