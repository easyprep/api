  "explanation": "The Indigo revolt was a peasant movement and subsequent uprising of indigo farmers against the indigo planters that arose in Bengal in 1859 just after the Revolt of 1857. <br />The peasants were compelled to plant Indigo rather than the food Crops. The peasants were provided loans called \\\"dadon\\\" for indigo planting which was at a very high interest rate. The loan made the people indebted and resulted in a rebellion. The leaders were Digambar and Bishnu Bishwas."
