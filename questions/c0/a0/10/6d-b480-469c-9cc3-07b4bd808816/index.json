  "explanation": "The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is a new global fund created to support the efforts of developing countries to respond to the challenge of climate change. GCF helps developing countries limit or reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and adapt to climate change. It seeks to promote a paradigm shift to low-emission and climate-resilient development, taking into accounts the needs of nations that are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts. In the Copenhagen Accord, established during the 2009, the decision to set up a “Green Climate Fund” was taken."
