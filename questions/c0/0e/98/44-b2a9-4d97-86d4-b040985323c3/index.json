It was described as the poorest and most miserable Spanish colony in all America. Costa Rica, itself, never fought for independence from Spain. In the Mexican War of Independence of 1810-1821, Spanish faced defeat and declared the independence of all Central America including Costa Rica. Costa Rica celebrates its independence day on 15 September every year."
