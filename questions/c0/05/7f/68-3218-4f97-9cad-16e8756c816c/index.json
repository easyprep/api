  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "There are two different sets of classifications &#8216;revenue vs capital expenditure&#8217; and &#8216; plan vs non-plan.&#8217;<br> In general, expenditure used to create assets (building a road for instance) is capital expenditure while revenue expenditure consists of expenses such as salaries and other administrative costs. Plan expenditure covers money spent on schemes or projects run by different ministries under the five-year plans.<br> Schemes Such as the MG National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme can have both revenue and capital components. For instance, the administrative costs of a plan scheme could be classified as revenue expenditure while the expenditure on the scheme itself (e.g. building a village road) might be capital expenditure. Non-plan expenditure consists of any expenditure by the government not covered by the five year plans. These include interest payments on government debt and expenditure on organs of the state such as the judiciary and the police."
