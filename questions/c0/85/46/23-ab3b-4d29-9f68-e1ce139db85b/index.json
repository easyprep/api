His peace deal with Eritrea ended a 20-year military stalemate following their 1998-2000 border war. Â Abiy was named as the winner of the 100th Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, where he will receive the award in December 2019. The award is seen as a welcome boost for Africa\\'s youngest leader as he faces worrying inter-community violence ahead of a parliamentary election in May 2020."
