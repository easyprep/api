  "option1": "Sardar Patel",
  "option2": "Jawaharlal Nehru",
  "option3": "Mohammad Ali Jinnah",
  "option4": "Liaqat Ali",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Jawaharlal Nehru",
  "explanation": "After geographical partition, there was a need of partition and equitable distribution of cash in treasuries, bank balances, records and archives, railways, institutes, printing presses, hospitals, army, government employees, and so onâ€”a formidable task, with potential for massive controversies and disagreements. The two main officials were HM Patel for India, and Chaudhary Muhammad Ali for Pakistan. They were overall in-charge, and guided ten expert committees looking into various division of assets and liabilities. What the expert committees could not resolve went to HM Patel and Chaudhary Muhammad Ali; what they, in turn, could not settle went to a Partition Council. The Partition Council comprised Sardar Patel and Rajendra Prasad, with Rajaji as alternate member. Pakistan was represented by MA Jinnah and Liaqat Ali, with Abdur Rab Nishtar as an alternate member."
