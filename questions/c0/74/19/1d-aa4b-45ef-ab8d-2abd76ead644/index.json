  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "<strong>Adjournment </strong>only terminates a sitting and not a session of the House. It is done by presiding officer of the House viz. Lok Sabha Speaker / Deputy speaker or Rajya Sabha Chairman / Deputy Chairman. Adjournment does not affect any kind of the bills. <strong>Prorogation</strong> not only terminates the sitting but also a session of the house. Prorogation is done by India's President. It also does not affect the bills."
