It is an ongoing mission to reclaim African territories back from Islamic extremist groups in the region. About 4,500 French soldiers are involved in the operation.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nDrones were used to neutralise jihadists in Mali for the first time by the French soldiers.
