  "question": "In light of Voyager-2 entering interstellar medium/ ISM, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The ISM has radiation but is devoid of matter.</li>\n<li>The ISM has uniform temperature.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe ISM is the region of outer space that is beyond the influence of the sun. It is the space between the star systems that are found in various galaxies. It has both radiation and matter. The matter in ISM include dust, gas in ionic, atomic and molecular forms, etc.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nISM does not have a uniform distribution of heat. It is made of different ‘phases’ with varying temperatures and densities. The colder parts of ISM are generally denser while the hotter parts are diffuse in nature. Heating of regions of ISM is by factors like cosmic radiation, UV and X-ray radiation, etc."
