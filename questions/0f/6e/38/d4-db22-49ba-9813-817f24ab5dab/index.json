  "option2": "3 Only",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "None",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "3 Only",
  "explanation": "Recently, India declared itself free from Trachoma, a chronic infective disease of the eye. As per the National Trachoma Survey Report (2014-17), the current overall prevalence found in the country is only 0.7%. However, this is still much below the elimination criteria of infective trachoma as defined by the WHO. Similarly, in June 2017, India declared itself free from highly pathogenic Avian Influenza- H5N1 and H5N8. Yaws is a kind of chronic bacterial infection which mostly affects skin, bones and joints. In 2016, WHO and UNICEF declared India free of Yaws."
