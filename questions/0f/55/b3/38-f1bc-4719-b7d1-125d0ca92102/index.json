  "question": "In light of recent studies deviating away from the use of the principle of ‘Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities’ or CBDR-RC, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It was given by the UNFCCC treaty.</li>\n<li>According to the principle, the developed countries have a greater role in mitigating climate change than the developing countries.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe recent report from US based Universal Ecological Fund titled ‘Truth Behind Climate Pledges’ made news for abandoning the CBDR-RC principle. This principle was put forth by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992. Because of the abandonment of the principle, developed countries have the same responsibility towards climate change as every other category of countries.\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe CBDR-RC principle provides that the developed nations have a greater role in mitigating the effects of climate change than the developing countries. This is achieved by classifying countries into various annexes. The developed countries under annex I have the maximum responsibility.\n&nbsp;"
