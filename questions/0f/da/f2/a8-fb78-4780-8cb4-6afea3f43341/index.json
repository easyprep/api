  "question": "“Gresham’s Law” in Economics relates which of the following?",
  "option1": "Supply and demand",
  "option2": "Circulation of currency",
  "option3": "Consumption and supply",
  "option4": "Distribution of goods and services",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Circulation of currency",
  "explanation": "Gresham\\'s law states that bad money drives out good. For example, if there are two forms of commodity money in circulation, which are accepted by law as having similar face value, the more valuable commodity will gradually disappear from circulation.<br />The law holds that bad money drives out good money in circulation. Bad money is then the currency that is considered to have equal or less value compared to its face value. Meanwhile, good money is currency that is believed to have greater value or more potential for greater value than its face value. Logically, consumers will choose to use bad money over good money because good money has the potential to be worth more than its face value."
