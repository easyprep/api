  "question": "It was verified recently that there is no microbial life at ponds of Dallol Geothermal Field. The field belongs to which country?",
  "option1": "Sudan",
  "option2": "Norway",
  "option3": "Mexico",
  "option4": "Ethiopia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Ethiopia",
  "explanation": "Researchers have found an aquatic environment on Earth with complete absence of any form of life. The findings revealed that any form of microbial life was absent in the hot, saline, hyperacid ponds of Dallol Geothermal Field in Ethiopia. The research was published in journal, ‘Nature Ecology and Evolution’.The researchers verified that there is no microbial life in these salty, hot and hyperacid pools or in the adjacent magnesium-rich brine lakes. The findings may lead to an improved understanding of limits of habitability."
