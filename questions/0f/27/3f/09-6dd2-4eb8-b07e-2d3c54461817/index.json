  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nIsrael uses paper ballots to cast votes. This time, there were 11,000 polling stations with about 4 million Israeli people voting. The elections have been held for the second time in September after the April elections failed to yield a majority to form the government.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nUnity government is a broad coalition government. It is formed especially in times of emergency like wars. It is also formed when an election fails to yield a majority. In Israelâ€™s history, national unity government between rival parties had been constituted in 1984 and in 2009.\n&nbsp;"
