  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe groundhog is a species belonging to the rodent family found in USA and Canada. It is also known as the woodchuck. The groundhog featured in the recent celebrations is called ‘Punxsutawney Phil’ and is used for predicting an early spring.\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe groundhog is a species that exhibits true hibernation. Hibernation is the process by which animals enter into a state of inactivity during the winter season. The amount of fat that an animal stores before going into hibernation determines when it emerges out of the depressed metabolic state."
