  "question": "The second spaceport of India is to be constructed at which place?",
  "option1": "Narora",
  "option2": "Kota",
  "option3": "Tuticorin",
  "option4": "Patna",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Tuticorin",
  "explanation": "The work on the countryâ€™s second spaceport has started at Tuticorin in Tamilnadu .The new launch pad will mainly cater to launches of newly developed Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV). Initially, the launches of the SSLV will be done from Sriharikota but once the second spaceport is completed, subsequent launches will be shifted there. The advantages of the new spaceport include straight southward launches as the current rockets have to be manoeuvred around Sri Lanka. The TN spaceport will also be ideal fro putting satellites in the polar orbit through a PSLV.<br />"
