  "answer": "2 & 3 Only",
  "explanation": "Money&nbsp;is borrowed by the government through issuance of securities, bonds and bills. Treasury bills (T-bills) offer short-term investment opportunities. The Government of India issues three types of treasury bills through auctions, namely, 91-day, 182-day and 364-day. When government borrows from market it reduces money in the hands of public and thus reduces spending which in turn helps to combat inflation. Government when reduces its public expenditures such as pension, provision, infrastructure, subsidies etc. then again it helps to curb inflation. Increase or decrease in Repo rate is a monetary policy carried by the central bank."
