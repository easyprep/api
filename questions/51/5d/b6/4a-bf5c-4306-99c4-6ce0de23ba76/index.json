  "question": "Consider the following statements with regard to Local Electrode Atom Probe (LEAP), recently in the news:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It is a high-performance microscope that can provide a precise atom-by-atom view of materials</li>\r\n<li>It will also provide atomic-scale insights into metallic materials</li>\r\n<li>It is the first microscope to be operated remotely through special terminal by researchers divided geographically</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "All the statements are correct: Recently, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Madras has commissioned remotely operable Local Electrode Atom Probe (LEAP) microscope. It is claimed to be worldâ€™s first remotely operable LEAP microscope. The LEAP microscope has been developed in a collaborative exercise involving eight top research institutions in country, spearheaded by IIT-M. Other partner institutions are IITs of Bombay, Delhi, Kanpur, Kharagpur and Ropar, International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials (ARCI) and Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences (BRNS).The Local Electrode Atom Probe (LEAP) had been developed in a collaborative exercise involving eight top research institutions in the country, spearheaded by IIT-M. LEAP is high-performance microscope that can provide a precise atom-by-atom view of materials. It provides atomic-scale insights into metallic,which will influence wide spectrum of industries ranging from steel to automobiles and energy to transportation sector. It will also give major thrust to research in nanotechnology, among other fields. It will also provide atomic-scale insights into metallic materials."
