  "question": "&nbsp; &nbsp; Consider the following pairs: <ol> <li>Grey water footprint -  Volume of freshwater required to dilute pollutants to such an extent that the quality of the water remains above agreed standards</li> <li>Blue water footprint -  Volume of surface and groundwater consumed as a result of the production of a good or service</li> <li>Green water footprint -  Volume of rainwater consumed during the production process</li> </ol> &nbsp; Which of the above is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option2": "3 Only",
  "option3": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "All of the above are correct<br> Green water footprint is particularly relevant for agricultural and forestry products.
