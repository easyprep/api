  "question": "Among the Road and infrastructure cess and the Special additional excise duty that were recently hiked by the Centre, which one is passed to the states through devolution?",
  "option1": "Road and infrastructure cess",
  "option2": "Special additional excise duty",
  "option3": "Both of them",
  "option4": "None of them",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Special additional excise duty",
  "explanation": "In a recent move, the Centre hiked the duties on petrol and diesel steeply and raised it to Rs 10 and Rs 13 per litre, respectively. It was also announced that there will be no change in the retail prices as the hike will be absorbed by the Oil Marketing companies.\r\nAmong the total hike, the Road and infrastructure cess will go the revenue of the Centre only whereas the special additional excise duty will be passed on to all states through devolution at 42%. This decision has been taken at the backdrop of falling crude oil prices in the global market and lower demand during the lock-down."
