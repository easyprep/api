  "option1": "Russia and Mongolia",
  "option2": "Russia and Ukraine",
  "option3": "Russia and Georgia",
  "option4": "Russia and Estonia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Russia and Georgia",
  "explanation": "The Roki Tunnel, also called Roksky Tunnel,  is a mountain tunnel of the Transkam road through the Greater Caucasus Mountains, north of the village Upper Roka. It is the only road joining North Ossetia–Alania in Russia into South Ossetia, a breakaway republic of Georgia. The tunnel has been important throughout the Georgian–Ossetian conflict. The South Ossetian authorities use tolls levied on tunnel traffic as one of their main sources of revenue. The Georgian government, backed by the United States, has long called for the South Ossetian side of the tunnel to be placed under the control of international monitors, rather than by the South Ossetian secessionists and their Russian allies."
