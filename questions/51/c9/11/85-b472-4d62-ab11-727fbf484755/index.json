  "explanation": "In Rajasthan, Union Textiles Minister Smriti Irani has recently inaugurated the \\'Titanwala Museum\\' in Bagru that showcases the Chhipa community\\'s hand-block printing. The museum will be open from Monday to Sunday between 9 am and 6 pm.  The Bagru hand-block printing is one of the traditional techniques of printing with natural colour followed by the chippas of a remote place of Rajasthan. It uses vegetable dye colors such as indigo/dabu (a mixture of mud resist dabu and indigo dip dyeing techniques) and harda (which is a yellow base color). The art of block printing is a labor intensive process which requires lot of skillfulness, time and tolerance power of artisan. The wooden blocks of teak-wood are used for printing the design which are soaked in oil overnight and then washed before put to use. These collections of block are considered to be the wealth of Chhipaâ€™s that they have collected over a period of time. The cloth to be printed is soaked in the solution of clay and other chemicals to make the fabric soften and then dried before used for printing. Neat stamping is foremost to get the appealing prints.After printing, cloth is left for drying in sun for final touch-up. Different types of motifs used in Bagru printing are Aath Kaliya, Chopad, and Kamal."
