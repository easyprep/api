  "question": "Which of the following is the oldest Hindu epic?",
  "option1": "Mahabhashya",
  "option2": "Ramayana",
  "option3": "Ashtadhyayi",
  "option4": "Mahabharata",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Ramayana",
  "explanation": "The Ramayana and the Mahabharata, which were originally composed in Sanskrit and later translated into many other Indian languages, and The Five Great Epics of Tamil Literature and Sangam literature, are some of the oldest surviving epic poems ever written. Chronologically, Ramayana happened before Mahabharata. There are many facts to support this like Ramayana happened in the Treta Yuga which comes before the Dvapara Yuga (Mahabharata) and Rama (Ramayana) was the 7th avatar of Vishnu, while Krishna (Mahabharata) was the 8th avatar of Vishnu."
