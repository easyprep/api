  "answer": "A German computer scientist",
  "explanation": "Konrad Zuse, the inventor of the world's first programmable computer, was a German computer scientist. Konrad Zuse (22 June 1910 â€“ 18 December 1995) was a German civil engineer, pioneering computer scientist, inventor and businessman. His greatest achievement was the world's first programmable computer; the functional program-controlled Turing-complete Z3 became operational in May 1941. Zuse has often been regarded as the inventor of the modern computer. Zuse was noted for the S2 computing machine, considered the first process control computer. In 1941, he founded one of the earliest computer businesses, producing the Z4, which became the world's first commercial computer. From 1943 to 1945 he designed the first high-level programming language, Plankalkul. In 1969, Zuse suggested the concept of a computation-based universe in his book Rechnender Raum (Calculating Space). He was a recipient of several awards such as Werner von Siemens Ring in 1964; Harry H. Goode Memorial Award in 1965 (together with George Stibitz); Wilhelm Exner Medal, 1969; Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1972; Computer History Museum Fellow Award in 1999."
