The mission costs approximately Rs. 378 crores. The project was conceived in 2008. Initially it was planned to launch the Aditya-1 satellite as a low-earth orbit satellite but subsequently the plan was changed and now ISRO is planning to place the satellite at Lagrangian point L1. The upgraded mission is called Aditya-L1."
