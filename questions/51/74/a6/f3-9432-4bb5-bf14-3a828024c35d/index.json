  "question": "What is the difference between an explosion and combustion?",
  "option1": "In the former nuclear reaction takes place while in the latter case burning takes place",
  "option2": "In the former chemical energy is transformed into nuclear energy while in the latter case the chemical energy is transformed into heat energy",
  "option3": "In the former it is violent and rapid reaction with release of much heat energy while in the latter case it is generally slow reaction with release of less heat energy",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "In the former it is violent and rapid reaction with release of much heat energy while in the latter case it is generally slow reaction with release of less heat energy",
  "explanation": "The speed of the reaction is what distinguishes an explosive reaction from an ordinary combustion reaction. Unless the reaction occurs very rapidly, the thermally expanding gases will be moderately dissipated in the medium, with no large differential in pressure and there will be no explosion. Explosion has high intensity and produces high intensity shock waves."
