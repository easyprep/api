  "question": "With reference to the NGT highlighting the environmentally unsustainable practice in brick kilns, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The pollution control board recommends the use of fixed-chimney bull’s trench kiln (FCBTK) technology for firing kilns.</li>\n<li>The pollution control board recommends the use of zigzag technology for firing kilns.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong> Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe fixed-chimney bull’s trench kiln (FCBTK) is a highly polluting technology that the centre is trying to phase out from the kilns. It makes use of hazardous fuels like plastic shreds and rubber wastes. It consists of a central chimney around which the bricks are stacked to be fired in trenches in columns. The air flows through these in straight lines.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nZigzag technology is recommended by the CPCB. It uses 25% lesser coal and produces up to 70% lesser suspended particulate matter. Instead of straight paths, the hot air is made to travel through zigzag paths. This increases the time of contact between the hot air and the bricks as the path is three times longer than in FCBTK.\n&nbsp;"
