  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about Fronts?<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Frontogenesis involves convergence of two distinct air masses.</li>\r\n<li>Frontolysis involves overriding of one of the air mass by another.</li>\r\n<li>In northern hemisphere Frontogenesis happens in clockwise direction and in southern hemisphere, anti-clockwise direction.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The boundary zone when two different type of air masses meet is called a Front. The process of its formation is known as frontogenesis.<br />Frontogenesis involves convergence of two distinct air masses.<br />Frontolysis involves overriding of one of the air mass by another.<br />In northern hemisphere Frontogenesis happens in anti-clockwise direction and in southern hemisphere, clockwise direction."
