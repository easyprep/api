  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe SC and ST Act does not provide for crimes committed by members of the SC and ST communities. The act is applicable only if the crime is committed by a non-SC and non-ST member on a member of the SC or ST community.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe act provides protection against economic exploitation of SC and ST members of the society. Economic activity is identified as a part of the reason for atrocities against the SC and ST members. The state is to make the members economically self-reliant."
