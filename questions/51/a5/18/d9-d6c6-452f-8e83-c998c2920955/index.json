  "answer": "Ullas Narayan",
  "explanation": "Ullas Narayan has created history by winning India\\'s first ever International medal in Ultra Running. He finished third at the 2018 International Association of Ultra Running (IAU) 24 Hour Asia & Oceania Championship in Taipei. A group bronze medal was also won by the Indian team which had Narayan (250 km), Sunil Sharma (202 km) and LL Meena (192 km). Ultra races involve running over extremely long distances which are far longer than the traditional races. These races take place over two modalities â€“ either over a set distance like 50 km, 100 km and longer events or a set time (like 6 hr, 24 hr, and multi-day events)."
