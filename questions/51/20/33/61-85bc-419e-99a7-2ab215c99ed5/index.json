  "question": "In which of the following cycles, insects play crucial role?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Carbon cycle</li>\r\n<li>Nitrogen Cycle</li>\r\n<li>Food cycle</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "This question can be justified with example of just one insect - cockroach, though the millions of species of insects help to sustain the delicate ecosystems. Most cockroaches feed on decaying organic matter, which traps a lot of nitrogen. The cockroach’s feeding has the effect of releasing that nitrogen (in their faeces) which then gets into the soil and is used by plants. The earth’s 5,000—10,000 cockroach species are also an important source of food for many birds and small mammals such as mice and rats, and thus an important part of the food cycle."
