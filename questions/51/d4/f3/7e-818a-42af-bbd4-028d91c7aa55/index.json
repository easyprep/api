  "question": "Which one of the following statements regarding starch and cellulose is not correct?",
  "option1": "Both of them are of plant origin",
  "option2": "Both of them are polymers",
  "option3": "Both of them give colour with iodine",
  "option4": "Both of them are made up of glucose molecules",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both of them give colour with iodine",
  "explanation": "Starch and cellulose both are plant origin. Starch deposits in plant cells, whereas cellulose is most important constituent of plant cell wall. Both starch and cellulose are polymers. Starch is branched polymer of α – D – glucose unit linked by α – 1, 4 glycosidic bond. Cellulose is a linear polymer of β – D – glucose unit.  Glucose molecules are present in both starch and cellulose. Amylose in starch is responsible for the formation of deep blue colour in the presence of iodine but cellulose does not give any colour at the treatment with iodine, because amylose is absent in cellulose."
