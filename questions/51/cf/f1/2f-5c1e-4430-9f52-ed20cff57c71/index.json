The British needed to surrender to the rebels for a safe passage to Allahabad but their evacuation turned into a massacre, resulting into death of around 120 British. The British forces from Allahabad recaptured Kanpur and then engaged into widespread retaliation with rebel soldiers and civilians. The leader in siege of Cawnpore was Nana Sahib."
