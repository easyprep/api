  "question": "The SC refused to put down guidelines for Speakers. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Speaker can be removed only be a resolution by the majority of the house.</li>\n<li>The Speaker holds a constitutional office.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Speaker can be removed from his/ her office in several instance apart from a majority resolution in the House. If the Speaker is declared to be of unsound mind, if found to be holding an office of profit, if he/ she voluntarily accepts the citizenship of another country, etc. removal from the post ensues.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Speaker holds a constitutional office. The SC refused to set down rules for the office because of this. Any such attempt would amount to interference of the judiciary into the legislative arm of the government. The Speaker holds the rank 6 in the Warrant of Precedence."
