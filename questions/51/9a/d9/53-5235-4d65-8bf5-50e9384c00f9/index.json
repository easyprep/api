  "question": "What is Young's Modulus?",
  "option1": "ratio of longitudinal strain to normal stress",
  "option2": "product of normal stress of longitudinal strain",
  "option3": "ratio of normal stress to longitudinal strain",
  "option4": "ratio of normal stress to lateral strain",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "ratio of normal stress to longitudinal strain",
  "explanation": "Young's Modulus is defined as the ratio of normal stress to longitudinal strain within limit of proportionality. Y = normal stress/longitudinal strain"
