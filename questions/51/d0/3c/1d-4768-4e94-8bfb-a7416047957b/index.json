  "question": "With reference to the recent progress in the North- east Natural Gas Pipeline Grid project, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It is to connect all states in the north-east.</li>\r\n<li>Natural gas has higher energy density than liquefied petroleum gas.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe North- east Natural Gas Pipeline is a project under the Urja Ganga Gas Pipeline project. It is to connect all the 8 states in the north- east. The pipeline is to be 1,656km long and is to connect the capitals of the states.\r\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe natural gas (or compressed natural gas) has a lower energy density than liquefied petroleum gas or LPG. The CNG has about 42% of the energy density as LPG. Energy density is the amount of energy stored in a unit volume of a fuel."
