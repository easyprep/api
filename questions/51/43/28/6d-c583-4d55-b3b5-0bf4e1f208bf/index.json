  "question": "The alpha-particle carries two positive charges. Its mass is very nearly equal to that of?",
  "option1": "two protons",
  "option2": "an atom of helium",
  "option3": "sum of masses of two positrons and two neutrons",
  "option4": "two positrons as each positron carries a single positive charge",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "an atom of helium",
  "explanation": "Each alpha particle contains two protons and two neutrons. Total number of nucleons = Number of protons + Number of neutrons = 2 + 2 = 4 Total number of nucleons = Mass number of an element Thus mass number of alpha particle is 4 which is equal to molecular weight of helium atom."
