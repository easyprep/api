The signatories are to prevent and punish genocide in times of war and peace. In November, Gambia filed a lawsuit against Myanmar, accusing the latter of committing genocide against the Rohingyas.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:        </strong>\nGambia is a member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. It is a muslim majority country in Africa. The country had obtained the support of the OIC members and also international lawyers in its lawsuit filed at the International Court of Justice in Hague."
