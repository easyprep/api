  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nChit funds are to be referred to as fraternity funds alternatively. This term is to be introduced if the Chit Funds bill is passed. Other terms for the chit funds are kuri or simply chit. In chit fund schemes, members pay an amount to the fund periodically and on member receives the amount by drawing of the chit.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nPrize chits are different from chit funds. The ROSCA or Rotating Savings and Credit Institution is another term for chit funds. The prize chit is banned under the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes (Banning) Act- a separate legislation passed in 1978."
