  "question": "Darjeeling tea is India&#8217;s most famous tea, 80% of whose production is exported. With this reference, consider the following statements: <ol> <li>Darjeeling tea is famous for its muscatel flavour</li> <li>It is India&#8217;s first Geographical Indication protected commodity</li> <li>It is a green tea with low caffeine content.</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 2",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Third statement is incorrect because Darjeeling tea is a black tea grown in the foothills of the Himalayan Mountains. The Darjeeling tea industry was recently making in news due to decreasing demand world wide, because of increasing cost. Climate-change has affected the tea cultivation in the region, thus, increasing the cost of production. This led to lower production of tea in the area leaving many workers to starvation deaths."
