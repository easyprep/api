  "answer": "2 and 4",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nDanube is Europe’s second longest river. Europe’s longest is the Volga River. Danube is 2,850km long and it drains into the Black Sea. It is an international waterway and navigable upto Romania by ocean ships. The term international waterway applies when the water body transcends state boundaries. They do not fall under any state’s jurisdiction.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nKerch strait is a link between the Black sea and the Sea of Azov. A bridge exists across the strait- Kerch strait bridge- that connects Russia and Crimea. It was the site of Russian capture of Ukrainian ships in 2018. The strait is a geopolitically valuable tool as Ukraine has to use it to exit the Sea of Azov.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Kerch strait separates Russia from the Crimean peninsula. Russia, in 2014, annexed Crimea. Crimea is now under the administration of Russia as federal subject. The Kerch Bridge or the Crimean Bridge that connects the two landmasses is 19 km long and opened to traffic in 2018.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is correct:\nThe International Tribunal for Law of the Sea is an international body created under the UN Convention on law of the Sea. It has 168 signatories. Located in Hamburg of Germany, it provides for law on all “ocean space, its uses and resources”. It has 21 serving judges from different states- including India. It condemned the 2014 Russia capture of the 3 Ukrainian ships."
