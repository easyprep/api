  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "All tropical cyclones are formed in areas of low atmospheric pressure in the Earth’s atmosphere. The pressures recorded at the centers of tropical cyclones are among the lowest that occur on Earth’s surface at sea level. Tropical cyclones are driven by the release of large amounts of latent heat of condensation, which occurs when moist air is carried upwards and its water vapour condenses. This heat is distributed vertically around the center of the storm. Thus, at any given altitude, environment inside the cyclone is warmer than its outer surroundings."
