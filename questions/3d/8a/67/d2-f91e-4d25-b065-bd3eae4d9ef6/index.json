  "explanation": "The joint military exercise \\\"Rapid Trident 2018\\\" has started in the western Ukrainian village of Starychi, which will continue from September 2 to 15. It was launched by Ukraine with the United States and a string of other NATO countries as tensions with Russia remain high over the Kremlin-backed insurgency in the country\\'s east. The aim of the exercise is to practice countering armed aggression in conditions of the hybrid war.  The exercise is composed of a multinational, brigade-level, computer-assisted command post exercise i.e. integrated with a battalion-level field training exercise, and a platoon-level situational training exercise. The Rapid Trident 2018 started a week before Russia holds its biggest military exercise \\\" Vostok-2018\\\" since the Cold War, in the east of the country and with the participation of China and Mongolia.  Approx 2,200 soldiers from 14 nations are participating in the exercise."
