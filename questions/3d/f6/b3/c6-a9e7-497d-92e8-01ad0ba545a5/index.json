  "option1": "I, II and III are correct",

  "option3": "I, II and IV are correct",
  "option4": "I and III are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "I, II and IV are correct",
  "explanation": "You can only get HIV by coming into direct contact with certain body fluids from a person with HIV who has a detectable viral load. These fluids are:<br />Blood<br />Semen and pre-seminal fluid<br />Rectal fluids<br />Vaginal fluids<br />Breast milk<br />For transmission to occur, the HIV in these fluids must get into the bloodstream of an HIV-negative person through a mucous membrane, open cuts or sores; or by direct injection. People with HIV who take HIV medicine daily as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of sexually transmitting HIV to their HIV-negative partners.\r\n&nbsp;"
