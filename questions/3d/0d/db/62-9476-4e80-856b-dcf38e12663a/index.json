  "question": "In context with the Catastrophic level fires in Australia in November, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The November fires were bushfires.</li>\n<li>Presence of Eucalyptus trees discourage such fires.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe November fires in Australia are bushfires. This category of fires rage across bush lands- characterised by vast expanses of grass and scrub with sparse trees. They occur during the warmer months aided by the countryâ€™s hot and dry climate.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nEucalyptus tree encourages wildfires. These trees are known for their fire-loving nature. Their essential oils are inflammable. The plants and trees like Eucalyptus in the region have evolved mechanisms to survive the bushfires. Eg: fire resistant seeds, lignotubers that are fire resistant, etc."
