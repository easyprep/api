  "question": "Consider the following statements about the <em>Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahaabhiyan</em> (KUSUM) Scheme: <ol> <li>It aims at promotion of decentralised solar power production</li> <li>It is a central sector scheme</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is correct</u>. <em>Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahaabhiyan</em> or KUSUM scheme aims at providing extra income to farmers, by giving them an option to sell additional power to the grid through solar power projects set up on their barren lands. It also aims to promote decentralised solar power production, energy efficiency, water conservation and provide water security to farmers. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u> because the government is going to provide 60% subsidy to farmers on purchase of solar pumps under the scheme. This subsidy will be shared between Centre and States. Banks will fund 30% of the cost and rest will have to be borne by the farmers. Central sector schemes are schemes with 100% funding by the Central government and implemented by the Central Government machinery."
