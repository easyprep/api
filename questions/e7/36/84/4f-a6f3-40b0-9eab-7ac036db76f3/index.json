  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Shooting",
  "explanation": "In shooting, 20-year old Elavenil Valarivan from India  claimed her first senior World Cup gold medal in the women\\'s 10m air rifle competition at Rio de Janeiro in Brazil on 28th August 2019. With this, Valarivan became the third Indian to achieve the feat. In her debut year at the senior level, Elavenil shot 251.7 in the finals to help India extend their new-found dominance in the event. Though, Valarivan\\'s top prize did not translate into an Olympic quota for India as Apurvi Chandela and Anjum Moudgil have already secured the maximum two berths available per country in 2018 World Championships.   Elavenil is a junior World Cup gold-medallist besides being an Asian champion."
