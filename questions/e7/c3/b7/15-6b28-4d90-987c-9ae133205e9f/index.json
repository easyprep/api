  "question": "An athlete runs 200 meters race in 24 seconds. His speed (in km/hr) is :",
  "option1": 28.5,
  "option2": 30,
  "option3": 24,
  "option4": 20,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 30,
  "explanation": "$latex Speed = \\\\frac{Distance }{Time}=\\\\frac{200}{24}m/s&s=1$\r\n$latex =>\\\\frac{200}{24}m/s=\\\\frac{200}{24}\\\\times \\\\frac{18}{5}=30 km/hr&s=1$\r\nHence option [B] is the right answer."
