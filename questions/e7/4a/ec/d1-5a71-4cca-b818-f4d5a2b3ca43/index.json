Belgian expedition under Sir Henry Morton Stanley received patronage from King Leopold II of Belgium to explore and administer Congo from 1870s. Belgians forced the local population of Congo to produce rubber and unleashed abuses through exploitation and diseases. In 1908, Belgian parliament annexed Congo as Belgian colony from King Leopold II of Belgium. In 1960, Mouvement National Congolais under Patrice Lumumba started the nationalist movement and won Parliamentary election. And in June 1960, Congo achieved independence and established as a republic of Congo or Congo-Leopoldville."
