  "question": "Consider the following statements about &quot;dirty bomb&quot;, a highly discussed topic at the Nuclear Security Summit 2016: <ol> <li>Dirty bomb is a tactical&nbsp;nuclear weapon&nbsp;</li> <li>A dirty bomb is often termed as a &quot;Weapon of Mass Destruction&quot;</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because &lsquo;Dirty bomb&rsquo; is in no way similar to a nuclear weapon or nuclear bomb. A nuclear bomb creates an explosion that is millions of times more powerful than that of a dirty bomb.<br> <u>Second statement is incorrect</u> because a dirty bomb is not a &quot;Weapon of Mass Destruction&quot; but a &quot;Weapon of Mass Disruption,&quot; because this does not cause many deaths by radiation exposure, but creates mass panic, and hence, it is called Weapon of Mass Disruption,&quot; where contamination and anxiety are the terrorists&rsquo; major objectives."
