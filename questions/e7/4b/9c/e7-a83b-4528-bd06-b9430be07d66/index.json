  "question": "Which among the following decide(s) whether a collapsing star would become a white dwarf or a black hole?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Mass</li>\r\n<li>Temperature</li>\r\n<li>Position in a galaxy</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "1 & 2",
  "option3": "2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "The collapse of a star is a natural process that occurs when all stellar energy sources are exhausted. If the mass of the collapsing part of the star is below a certain critical value, the end product is a compact star, either a white dwarf or a neutron star. But if the collapsing star has a mass exceeding this limit, the collapse will continue forever and form a black hole and astronomers believe that any collapsing star with solar mass above 0.7 will form a black hole."
