  "question": "South African Government declared _______ as a \"national disaster\" recently?",
  "option1": "Hurricanes",
  "option2": "Drought",
  "option3": "Floods",
  "option4": "Tornadoes",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Drought",
  "explanation": "South African Government declared the ongoing drought as a \"national disaster\". The drought has afflicted southern and western regions of South Africa including Cape Town. According to experts, this drought that began two years ago was triggered by El Nino (a complex phenomenon, developing in Pacific region, that causes global changes in temperature and rainfall). Declaring the ongoing drought as 'national disaster' implies that South African central government will now take responsibility for relief efforts. The drought is so severe that, April 12, 2018, was predicted as 'Day Zero' (date when its taps are expected to run dry) for Cape Town. However, due to water saving measures announced by the local authorities and duly adopted by the residents, \"Day Zero\" has now been pushed to June 4, 2018.",
