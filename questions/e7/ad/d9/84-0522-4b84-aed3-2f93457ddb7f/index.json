  "question": "A Pendulum Clock, whose pendulum is made up of a steel rod, will become slow if __: <br> 1. Temperature rises<br> 2. Taken to moon<br> 3. Taken from equator to pole<br> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The length of the pendulum increases if temperature increases and the time period T increases and a pendulum takes more time to complete one oscillation. That is why it becomes slow. As the moon's gravity of about 1/6 of Earth's gravity, and period of a pendulum increases with a decrease in gravity so it will take more time to complete one oscillation. When a pendulum is taken from the equator to the pole, gravity increases, Time period decreases and it will start oscillating faster."
