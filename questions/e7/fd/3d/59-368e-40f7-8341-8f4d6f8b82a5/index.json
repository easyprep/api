  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe gun amnesty scheme was launched by the New Zealand government in context with the Christchurch incident. The amnesty includes assault rifles and semi- automatic weapons. Over 56,000 firearms were turned over during this period. Apart from this, 1,88,000 parts of firearms were also turned in by the people.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:       </strong>\nA stand-out feature of the amnesty scheme is the ‘buy back’ concept. The firearms’ owners were given 95% of the firearms’ original cost for turning it in. The owners would also not be subject to any questioning during the turning over process."
