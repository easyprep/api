  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe scientists have developed a novel artefact that is neither a traditional robot nor a known animal species. The xenobot is being referred to as a living machine produced by repurposing living cells. They are capable of transporting payloads like drugs and also healing themselves.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe xenobot was made from the cells of frog- specifically their embryos. The xenobot was named after the Xenopus laevis- an aquatic frog species found in Sub-Saharan Africa in countries like Nigeria, Sudan and South Africa. The xenobots are only millimetres wide."
