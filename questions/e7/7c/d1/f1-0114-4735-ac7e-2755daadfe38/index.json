  "explanation": "The Union Tourism Ministry  has decided to offer e-Tourist Visa fee based on tourist footfall to  attract foreign travellers from over 160 countries to India. The ministry has proposed  to introduce  e-visa fee for  short duration of 30 days during peak tourism season  - from July to March -- at a charge of $25.  However,  the e-visa fee during the lean period -- from April to June -- is to be kept at $10. The Ministry also introduced a new 5 year e-tourist visa the fee of which will be $ 80 and the fees of one year e-visa would be $ 40.  Though, there will be no visa fee for tourists from 14 Pacific Island nations belonging to Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC) -- Fiji, Cook Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Niue Island, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu -- and Myanamar, Argentina, Indonesia, Jamaica, Mauritius, Seychelles, South Africa and Uruguay. Both the Ministry of Home Affairs (HA) and the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) have given approval to the flexible e-tourist visa regime."
