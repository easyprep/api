  "answer": "1 & 2 Only",
  "explanation": "The National Green Tribunal imposed the nationwide ban on use of glass-coated &#039;manja&#039; for flying kites as the sharp string poses a danger to humans, animals and birds. Also, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has imposed a complete ban on burning of waste in open places across the country. E15 is a low-level blend composed of 10.5%-15% ethanol and gasoline. There is no ban on use of E-15 as fuel."
