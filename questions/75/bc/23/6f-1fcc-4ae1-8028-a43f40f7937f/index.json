  "answer": "Australia",
  "explanation": "In a path-breaking move, Cricket Australia has recently launched new transgender inclusive policy to ensure transgender and gender-diverse people can take part in the game at the highest level in Australia.  The move aligns in accordance with the International Cricket Council’s (ICC’s) gender recognition policy and gender diversity guidelines. The policy sets out a testosterone limit for transgender and gender-diverse players who want to play for state and national women’s teams. To be eligible for elite women\\'s teams, the players must show a testosterone concentration of less than 10 nanomoles per litre over at least 12 months. They must also be able to demonstrate their elected gender is consistent with how they are living their lives on a daily basis. The guidelines cover everything from victimisation to privacy and providing suitable facilities, as well as the collection of personal information."
