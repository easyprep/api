  "question": "In which of the following conditions, a Balloon filled with a gas such as Hydrogen will tend to rise up?",
  "option1": "If the buoyant force exerted by the air on a balloon is greater than the weight of the balloon",
  "option2": "If the buoyant force exerted by the air on a balloon is less than the weight of the balloon",
  "option3": "If the buoyant force exerted by the air on a balloon is equal to the weight of the balloon",
  "option4": "If the density of the air is greater than the density of the gas filled in balloon",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "If the buoyant force exerted by the air on a balloon is greater than the weight of the balloon",
  "explanation": "A Balloon filled with a gas such as Hydrogen gas is much lighter in weight than the weight of air displaced by it. So the buoyant force exerted by the air on a balloon is greater than the weight of the balloon. The hydrogen gas which is lighter than air enables the balloon to float."
