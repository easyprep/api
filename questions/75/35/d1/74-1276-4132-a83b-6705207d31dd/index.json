He was 16 when the atomic attack happened, and was about 1.8 kilometers away from ground zero when the bomb hit. He suffered severe burns on his back. He appealed for the support of survivors and elimination of nuclear weapons throughout his life. Ten years after the bombing, Taniguchi formed a group with other survivors who experienced the ordeal."
