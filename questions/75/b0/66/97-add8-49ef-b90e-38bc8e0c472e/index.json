  "question": "The X-ray crystallography mainly uses which among the following properties of electromagnetic radiation?",
  "option1": "Reflection",
  "option2": "Diffraction",
  "option3": "Interference",
  "option4": "Refraction",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Diffraction",
  "explanation": "X-ray crystallography helps to determine the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal. The crystalline structure performs the diffraction and it causes a beam of incident X-rays to diffract into many specific directions."
