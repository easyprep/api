  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The elements Copper (atomic number 29), silver (atomic number 47), and gold (atomic number 79), are three of the few metals that can be found naturally in their elemental state. These three metals have found great use as coins and jewellery for a number of reasons, including their resistance to corrosion and their remarkable colors. They are all in the same group in the periodic table (group 11), which suggests they should have similar—though not identical—properties."
