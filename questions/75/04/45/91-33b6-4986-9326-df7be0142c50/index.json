  "question": "A boat takes half time in moving a certain distance downstream than upstream. The ratio of the speed of the boat in still water and that of the current is :",
  "option1": "3 : 1",
  "option2": "1 : 2",
  "option3": "4 : 3",
  "option4": "2 : 1",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "3 : 1",
  "explanation": "Let the speed of boat in still water = x km/hr, \r\nand Speed of current = y km/hr\r\nRate downstream = (x + y) km/hr, and Rate upstream = (x - y) km/hr\r\nDistance = Speed $latex \\\\times$ Time\r\n$latex \\\\therefore \\\\left ( x-y \\\\right )\\\\times 2t = \\\\left ( x+y \\\\right )\\\\times t$\r\n$latex => 2x-2y = x+y$\r\n$latex => 2x-x = 2y+y$\r\n$latex => x = 3y$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{x}{y} = \\\\frac{3}{1} = 3 : 1&s=1$\r\nHence option [A] is correct answer."
