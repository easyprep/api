  "question": "Which among the following is a correct definition of the Closed Fuel Cycle?",
  "option1": "Preparation of fuel and subsequent processes during reactor operation",
  "option2": "Closed Fuel Cycle refers to the process of separating the spent fuel",
  "option3": "Closed Fuel cycle is the process in which spent fuel is reprocessed",
  "option4": "Closed Fuel cycle is the process in which spent fuel is NOT reprocessed",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Closed Fuel cycle is the process in which spent fuel is reprocessed",
  "explanation": "The nuclear fuel cycle or Nuclear Fuel Chain is the progression of nuclear fuel through a series of differing stages. It has two parts: 1.Front End: It includes the preparation of the fuel and steps in the service period in which the fuel is used during reactor operation. 2.Back End: Which includes the steps to safely manage, contain, and either reprocess or dispose of spent nuclear fuel. When the spent fuel is reprocessed, it is a closed Fuel Cycle. When the spent Fuel is not reprocessed, it is an open fuel Cycle."
