In it, people are invited to share images of the Childline 1098 logo that they spot at unique locations and send it with a tagline. The #Childline1098 contest carries a cash price of Rs 2,000. The details of the contest are available on the Facebook and Twitter accounts of the ministry. The Childline 1098 is India\\'s first 24-hour, free, nationwide emergency phone service for children in need of aid and assistance. At present, it is operational at 450 locations including 76 key railway stations. As Railways often act as carriers of trafficked children, the Ministry signed an MoU with the Ministry of Railways to rescue and rehabilitate runaway, abandoned, kidnapped and trafficked children via Railways."
