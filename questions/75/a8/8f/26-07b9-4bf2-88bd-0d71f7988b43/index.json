  "option2": "Chander Mohan",
  "option3": "Krishan Sabnani",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Chander Mohan",
  "explanation": "Prof. Chander Mohan, an Indian-American scientist,  has identified as many as 50 protein biomarkers that can non-invasively detect Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) - a gut disorder that leads to diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, and weight loss. Mohan, who is  professor at University of Houston in the US, received a $ 347,490 grant from the Crohn\\'s & Colitis Foundation of America.  Along with IBD expert Subra Kugathasan, a gastroenterologist at Emory University in the US, Mohan is examining stool protein biomarkers that indicate the disease. IBD occurs when the body\\'s immune system fights its intestinal cells. Two of the most common types are Crohn\\'s disease and ulcerative colitis, both of which cause inflammation in the digestive tract."
