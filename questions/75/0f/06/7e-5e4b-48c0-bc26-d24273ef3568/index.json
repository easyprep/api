  "question": "94 is divided into two parts in such a way that the fifth part of the first and the eighth part of the second are in the ratio 3 : 4. The first part is :",
  "option1": 28,
  "option2": 30,
  "option3": 36,
  "option4": 40,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 30,
  "explanation": "First part = x \r\nand second part = 94 - x\r\n$latex \\\\therefore \\\\frac{\\\\frac{x}{5}}{\\\\frac{94-x}{8}} = \\\\frac{3}{4}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{x}{5}\\\\times \\\\frac{8}{\\\\left ( 94-x \\\\right )}= \\\\frac{3}{4}&s=1$\r\n$latex => 32x = 15\\\\times 94 - 15x$\r\n$latex => 47x = 15\\\\times 94$\r\n$latex => x = \\\\frac{15\\\\times 94}{47} = 30&s=1$\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer."
