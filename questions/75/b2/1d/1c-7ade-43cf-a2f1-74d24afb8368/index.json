  "question": "What do we call an undoped semiconductor?",
  "option1": "Intrinsic semiconductor",
  "option2": "Extrinsic semiconductor",
  "option3": "p-type semiconductor",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Intrinsic semiconductor",
  "explanation": "An intrinsic semiconductor is an undoped semiconductor. This means that holes in the valence band are vacancies created by electrons that have been thermally excited to the conduction band."
