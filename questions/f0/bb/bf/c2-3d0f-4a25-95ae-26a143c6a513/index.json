  "option1": "Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC)",
  "option2": "European Organization for Nuclear Research",
  "option3": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration",
  "option4": "Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "European Organization for Nuclear Research",
  "explanation": "DUNE prototype detectors are under construction at the European research center CERN. The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a leading-edge, international experiment for neutrino science and proton decay studies. DUNE will consist of two neutrino detectors placed in the worldâ€™s most intense neutrino beam. One detector will record particle interactions near the source of the beam, at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois. A second, much larger, detector will be installed more than a kilometre underground at the Sanford Underground Research Laboratory in Lead, South Dakota- 1,300 kilometers downstream of the source."
