  "question": "Which of the following properties are found in Quartz - a versatile material used in various electronic items?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Piezoelectricity</li>\r\n<li>Pyroelectricity</li>\r\n<li>Photovoltaic effect</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "1 & 2",
  "option3": "1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Besides being transparent, tough, and having a constant chemical composition, there are two other reasons why quartz is so versatile for use in electronics. First, quartz is one of several piezoelectric minerals. This means that when pressure is applied to the mineral, a positive electrical charge is created at one end of the crystal and a negative electric charge at the other end. Quartz is also strongly pyroelectric: Temperature changes create positive and negative charges within the crystal."
