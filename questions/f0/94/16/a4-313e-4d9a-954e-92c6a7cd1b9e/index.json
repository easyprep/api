  "question": "On which of the following does the resistance of a conductor depend?",
  "option1": "Length",
  "option2": "Area of cross-section",
  "option3": "Nature of material",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "The resistance of any conductor depends on : 1. its length 2. Area of its cross-section 3. Nature of its material The resistance of a uniform metallic conductor is directly proportional to its length and inversely proportional to its area of cross-section and is given by the formula:"
