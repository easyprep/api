  "explanation": "The Anti-Leprosy Day is observed every year in India on the Martyrdom Day of Mahatma Gandhi on January 30, remembers his selfless efforts and care for the people affected by leprosy. The day aims to make people aware of the real need to fight the infectious disease. On this day, a campaign named â€˜Sparsh Leprosy Awareness Campaign (SLAC)\\\" has been organised in all the Gram Sabhas throughout the country by the Central Leprosy Division of the Health Ministry. The campaign carries important information about the disease to help affected people. It includes free of cost multidrug therapy that is available at all government dispensaries, health centres and hospitals to provide complete treatment. The facility is given to all the affected people as only timely treatment prevents disability caused due to the disease. Some important symptoms of leprosy are light colour patches, redness, swelling and nodule formation over the skin."
