  "answer": "1, 2 and 3",
  "explanation": "The Paracel Islands are a group of small islands and reefs in the South China Sea administered by the People’s Republic of China but also claimed by Vietnam. Taiwan once claimed to be the legitimate government representing the entire sovereignty of China, of which it considered the Paracel Islands a part.<br />The Spratly Islands are even more complicated. About 45 islands are occupied by relatively small numbers of military forces from China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Brunei has established a fishing zone that overlaps a southern reef but has not made any formal claim.The Paracel Islands are surrounded by productive fishing grounds and by potential oil and gas reserves. In 1932, French Indochina annexed the islands and set up a weather station on Pattle Island; maintenance was continued by its successor, Vietnam. China has occupied the Paracel Islands since 1974, when its troops seized a South Vietnamese garrison occupying the western islands. China built a military installation on Mischief Reef in 1999. The islands are claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam."
