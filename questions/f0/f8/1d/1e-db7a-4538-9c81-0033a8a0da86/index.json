  "answer": "Judicial Plan of 1793",
  "explanation": "Court fees which was imposed in the judicial plan of 1787 was abolished by Judicial Plan of 1793. The court fee was abolished so that the people could easily reach to the court for securing justice. Before this scheme, litigation was very costly not only because the litigants had to travel a long distance and pay heavy fees to the Vakils. But also because there was a heavy Court-fee to be paid by the litigants. Cornwallis desired to abolish the Court-fees so that justice may be available to all."
