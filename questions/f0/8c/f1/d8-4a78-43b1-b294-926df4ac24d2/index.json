  "answer": "endocarp",
  "explanation": "Endocarp is a botanical term for the inside layer of the pericarp (or fruit), which directly surrounds the seeds. It may be membranous as in citrus where it is the only part consumed, or thick and hard as in the stone fruits of the family Rosaceae such as peaches, cherries, plums, and apricots. In nuts, it is the stony layer that surrounds the kernel of pecans, walnuts, etc., and that is removed prior to consumption. In citrus fruits, the endocarp is separated into sections, which are called segments. These segments are filled with juice vesicles, which contain the juice of the fruit. {Source: <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_anatomy#Mesocarp\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Wiki</a>}"
