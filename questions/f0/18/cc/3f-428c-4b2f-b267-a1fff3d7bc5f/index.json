  "question": "Consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Magma is present everywhere below earth’s surface</li>\r\n<li>Magma most likely originate in lower parts of earth’s crust and upper parts of earth’s mantle</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "<p class=\\\"Notes\\\">Magma does not occur everywhere below us. There are only some specific places where volcanoes exist. This means that Magma is formed under some special conditions, which exist in some limited area. Magmas are most likely to originate in the mantle from melting of mantle peridotite, (a rock made up of olivine, pyroxene, and garnet) — evidence comes from pieces brought up by erupting volcanoes."
