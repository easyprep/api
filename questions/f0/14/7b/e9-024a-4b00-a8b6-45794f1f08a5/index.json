  "question": "The first silk processing plant of the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) is set up in which state, to boost production of Patola sarees?",
  "option1": "Maharashtra",
  "option2": "Gujarat",
  "option3": "Rajasthan",
  "option4": "Madhya Pradesh",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Gujarat",
  "explanation": "The Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) inaugurated their first silk processing plant at Surendranagar district in Gujarat. The Patola is a trademark saree variety of Gujarat. It is regarded as a royal attire as it is priced very high. The reason for high price is the non-availability of processing plants in Gujarat. The silk yarn required to weave the saree is usually purchased from other states. This new plant set up by KVIC would cut down the price of silk yarn and boost production of Patola sarees."
