  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nSudan is located to the east of Chad. Both are located in the African continent. The illegal gold mining in Chad began a decade ago and is of attraction to immigrants, especially from Sudan. The mine accident in September was caused by a landslide.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nChad is a landlocked country. It is bordered by Sudan in the east, Niger and Nigeria in the west, Cameroon and Central African Republic in the south and Libya in the north. The accident took place along the Libyan border in Tibesti region, which is noted for its lawlessness and meagre government presence."
