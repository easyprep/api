  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Recently, the HRD Ministry has decided to include “Paika Bidroha” (Paika rebellion) of 1817 as “the First War of Independence” in history books from the next academic session. Paikas were peasant militia under the Gajapati rulers of Odisha who rendered military service to the king during times of war. They rebelled against the British rule under the leadership of Bakshi Jagabandhu Bidyadhara as early as 1817. In 1817, the Paikas attacked British symbols of power, setting ablaze police stations, administrative offices and the treasury during their march towards Khurda, from where the British fled. The Paikas were supported by the rajas of Kanika, Kujang, Nayagarh and Ghumusar and Zamindars, village heads and ordinary peasants. The rebellion quickly spread to Purl, Pipli Cuttack and other parts of the province. The British were initially taken aback and then tried to regain lost ground but faced stiff resistance from the rebelling Paikas. But finally the British managed to defeat Paikas within three months."
