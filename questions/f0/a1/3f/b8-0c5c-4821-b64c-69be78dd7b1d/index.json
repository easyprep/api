  "answer": "Less devlopment of interior region",
  "explanation": "The lack of infrastructure creates a lot of problems mainly regarding the development of interior regions. The two most vital sectors i.e. agriculture and industry could not make much headway in the absence of proper infrastructural facilities in the country. Moreover, due to the absence of proper infrastructural facilities, the development potential of different regions of the country largely remains under-utilized."
