  "question": "With respect to LCA Tejas’s successful arrested landing test, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Tejas is the smallest aircraft in its class.</li>\n<li>It has final operational clearance.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nLCA Tejas is an indigenously developed fighter jet. It is the world’s smallest and lightest supersonic craft in its category. Because of its small size, it has lower radar cross section. DRDO got the permission to build in 1983 and it performed the maiden flight in 2001.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:        </strong>\nThe fight got operational clearance in February 2019 from DRDO. The criteria for this clearance are mid-air refuelling, electronic warfare capacities, AESA radar, etc. among other battle-time capabilities. With the current success in arrested landing, it will be cleared for use aboard aircraft carriers.\n&nbsp;"
