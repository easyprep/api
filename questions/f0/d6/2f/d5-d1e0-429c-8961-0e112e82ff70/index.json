  "option2": 4,
  "option3": 5,
  "option4": 6,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 5,
  "explanation": "LCM of 4, 6, 10, 15 = 60\r\nLeast number of 6 digits = 100000\r\nThe leats number of 6 digits which is exactly divisible by 60 = 100000 + (60 - 40) = 100020\r\nâˆ´ Required Number = 100020 + 2 = 100022\r\nHence, the sum of digits = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 2 = 5\r\nHence option [C] is correct answer."
