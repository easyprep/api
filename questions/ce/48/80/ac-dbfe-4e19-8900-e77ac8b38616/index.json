  "question": "Consider the following regarding the differences between ‘holography’ and ‘photography’:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>When a photograph is cut in half, each piece shows half of the scene. When a hologram is cut in half, the whole scene can still be seen in each piece.</li>\r\n<li>A lens is required in photography to record the image, whereas in holography, the light from the object is scattered directly onto the recording medium.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the statement(s) which is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 and 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2",
  "explanation": "A photograph can be recorded using lens and normal light sources but in case of holography, laser is required and the light from the object is scattered directly onto the recording medium. After cutting of a photograph, each piece shows half of the scene but in holography, each piece shows the whole scene."
