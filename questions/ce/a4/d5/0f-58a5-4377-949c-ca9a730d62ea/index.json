  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because Bollgard-II has been developed by Monsanto Company, which is a publically traded American&nbsp;multinational. Bt&nbsp;<em>cotton</em>&nbsp;is the first crop to be approved for commercial cultivation in India but the first crop to be developed in India was&nbsp;Bt Brinjal. Bollgard II was introduced in India in 2002. Since its introduction the cotton yields increased by 67 per cent, and pesticides use decreased by 33 per cent in the country."
