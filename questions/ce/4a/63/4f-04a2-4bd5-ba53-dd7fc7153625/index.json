  "explanation": "German silver varies in composition, the percentage of the three elements ranging approximately as follows: copper, from 50% to 61.6%; zinc, from 19% to 17.2%; nickel, from 30% to 21.1%. The proportions are always specified in commercial alloys.<br />A type of lead-free solder made from tin and copper. SnCu is a commonly used type of lead-free solder. A metal alloy, with a melting point or melting range below 840°F (450°C), which is melted to join metallic surfaces. Powdered solder alloy formed into small spheres and coated with a layer of flux.<br />Calcium hypochlorite is an inorganic compound with formula Ca(ClO)₂. It is the main active ingredient of commercial products called bleaching powder, chlorine powder, or chlorinated lime, used for water treatment and as a bleaching agent.<br />Hyponatremia is the term used to describe low sodium levels in the bloodstream (hypo=low + natr=sodium + emia=blood). Acute hyponatremia describes the situation in which sodium levels drop quickly, while chronic hyponatremia describes situations with a gradual fall in the sodium concentrations over days or weeks."
