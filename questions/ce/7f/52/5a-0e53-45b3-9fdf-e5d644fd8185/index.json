  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The equatorial vegetation comprises a multitude of evergreen trees, e.g. mahogany, ebony, dyewoods etc. All plants struggle upwards (most epiphytes) for sunlight resulting in a peculiar layer arrangement (canopy). High temperature and abundant rainfall support a luxuriant tropical rain forest. In the coastal areas and brackish swamps, mangrove forests thrive."
