  "option5": "",
  "answer": 0.15,
  "explanation": "Marked price = Rs. 720\r\nActual price = Rs. 550.80\r\nFirst discount = 10%\r\nLet the second discount be x%\r\nThen, we can write 720(1 - 0.10)(1 - 0.01x) = 550.80\r\n$latex =>$720 $latex \\\\times$ 0.9(1 - 0.01x) = 550.80\r\n$latex =>$648(1 - 0.01x) = 550.80\r\n$latex => 1-0.01x=\\\\frac{550.8}{648}&s=1$\r\n$latex =>0.01x=1-\\\\frac{550.8}{648}&s=1$\r\n$latex =>x=\\\\frac{1-0.85}{0.01}&s=1$\r\n$latex =>x=0.15\\\\times 100$\r\n$latex =>x=15$\r\nHence option [B] is the right answer."
