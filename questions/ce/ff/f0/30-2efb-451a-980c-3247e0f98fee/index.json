  "question": "Which of the following is the first leader to lose Freedom of Paris award?",
  "option1": "Aung San Suu Kyi",
  "option2": "Evo Morales",
  "option3": "Tabare Vazquez",
  "option4": "Miguel Díaz-Canel",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Aung San Suu Kyi",
  "explanation": "Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel peace laureate & Myanmar leader,  will be stripped of Freedom of Paris award over her failure to speak out against a crackdown on Myanmar\\'s Rohingya minority. The move, which follows similar decisions by Glasgow, Edinburgh and Oxford, would make Myanmar\\'s de facto leader the first person to lose the freedom of the French capital, a purely symbolic award. The move will be finalised by the city council at a meeting in mid-December 2018. Apart from this,  Suu Kyi has already been stripped of her honorary Canadian citizenship and her Amnesty International\\'s \\\"Ambassador of Conscience Award\\\".  In 2017, nearly 5,00,000 people belonging to Myanmar’s Rohingya minority have been displaced after violence allegedly instigated by the country’s military, causing a major humanitarian crisis."
