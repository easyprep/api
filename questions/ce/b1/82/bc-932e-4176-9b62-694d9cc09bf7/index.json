  "explanation": "The Kuthiyottam ritual is usually performed every year during the Pongala festival at the Attukal Bhagavathy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. It was in news recently, when on February 28, 2018, the Kerala State Commission for the Protection of Child Rights registered a suo motu case in connection with the Kuthiyottam ritual. The Kuthiyottam ritual involves young boys to participate in severe penance. Nearly 1,000 young boys undertake a seven-day penance before Pongala day. As per ancient texts, these boys are said to represent the wounded soldiers of the goddess. The boys have to observe strict discipline and stay inside the temple for seven days. The rigours include sleeping on the floor, strict diet restrictions, and bathing three times a day. They also have to prostrate 1,008 times before the deity. It also involves piercing the childâ€™s side with a small hook and knotting a thread through it to symbolise their bond with the Goddess. All these activities were recently reported against the child rights and a suo motu case has been registered by the Kerala State Commission against the Kuthiyottam ritual. The Attukal Pongala Mahotsavam is a 10 days festival which falls in February - March every year."
