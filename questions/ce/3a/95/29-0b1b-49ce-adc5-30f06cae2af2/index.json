  "question": "In context with the recent discovery of the fossils of the ancient Najash in Argentina, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is a marine snake.</li>\n<li>It possessed hind limbs.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nNajash rionegrina is an ancient snake. It is about 95 million years old and lived on land. It is named after the biblical snake called Nahash. Its skeleton was found in the Kokorkom desert, which existed in Argentina during the late Cretaceous period.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nA unique feature of the Najash skeleton is the presence of hind limbs. This shows the evolutionary link between modern day snakes and lizards. Another unique feature is the presence of the pelvis connected to its spine. This is absent in modern snakes."
