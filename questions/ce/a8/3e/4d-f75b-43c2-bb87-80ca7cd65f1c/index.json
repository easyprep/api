  "option2": 1768,
  "option3": 1802,

  "option5": "",
  "answer": 1833,
  "explanation": "There was a right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London from the Federal Court of India. The Judicial Committee of Privy Council acted as an appellate body since 1726 with the establishment of Mayorâ€™s Court in India. It first started working via the system of committees and sub-committees. This system was not perfect and created problems. Via the Judicial Committee Act, 1833, the Privy Council was reformed and then it came into formal existence. Privy Council was thus created on 14th Aug. 1833 by the Act of the Parliament. Via this act, the Privy Council was empowered to hear appeals from the courts in British Colonies."
