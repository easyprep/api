Though the seismic event was recorded by the seismograms of many countries such as Kenya, Chile, New Zealand, Canada, and Hawaii, it was felt by none. The seismic waves lasted for over 20 minutes. The cause of the event and tremors was identified in May 2019, when an 800-meter high undersea volcano was found that was not there before.</p>"
