  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "Deforestation is not the major cause for increase in PM2.5; neither can afforestation help in decreasing the PM2.5 level. The only way to cut its reduction is to cut its emission sources like cars, factories, waste burning and thermal power plants."
