  "question": "In light of the recent discussions to bring urea under the nutrient based subsidy (NBS) rate system, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The NBS rates are universal to all states.</li>\n<li>The NBS system is applicable to potassium and phosphorus based fertilisers.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe nutrient based subsidy rates are not universal. The different rates will be applicable to different states. The rate will be determined based on the size of the landholdings and also the soil profile of the states. Eg: farmers in Punjab will get a more subsidises rate than farmers in West Bengal because of the soil profile.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe NBS scheme was introduced in 2010 to promote balance and efficient use of fertilisers. It was introduced for application to potassium and phosphorus based fertilisers that were subsidised for farm use. However, urea was an exception. It is being implemented by the fertiliser department at the centre."
