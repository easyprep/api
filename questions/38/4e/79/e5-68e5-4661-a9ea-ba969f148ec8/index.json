  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe Chandrayaan-3 project is the repeat mission of the previous Chandrayaan-2. ISRO announced that the mission is to be launched in 2021. The landing is to be at the same site as targeted by Chandrayaan-2. While the previous mission was completed with 960 crore INR, the upcoming mission is to be developed at a lower cost (Rs 250 plus 365 crores).\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe Chandrayaan- 3 mission is not to include an orbiter. It will include a lander, a rover and a propulsion module. The lunar project is being developed simultaneously with the Gaganyaan project- a manned mission. 2020 is to feature over 25 missions."
