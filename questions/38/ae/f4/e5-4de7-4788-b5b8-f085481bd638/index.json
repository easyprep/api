  "question": "Acid rain is capable of damaging the buildings and historic monuments which are made up of rocks such as limestone and marble. Which among the following is the end product of such<br> reaction?",
  "option1": "Quick Lime",
  "option2": "Calcium Carbonate",
  "option3": "Calcium Hydroxide",
  "option4": "Gypsum",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Gypsum",
  "explanation": "Acid rain is capable of damaging the buildings and historic monuments which are made up of rocks such as limestone and marble. This is because these rocks contain a large amount of Calcium Carbonate, which reacts with the Sulfuric Acid to create Gypsum. Gypsum flakes off easily. This is shown in the following reaction: CaC03 (s) + H2S04 (aq) â€“ CaS04 (aq) + C02 (g) + H20 (I)"
