  "question": "A shopkeeper allows three types of successive discounts as\r\n(i) 35% and 5%, (ii) 30% and 10%, (iii) 25% and 15%\r\nWhich discount is the best for a purchaser?",
  "option1": "First",
  "option2": "Second",
  "option3": "Third",
  "option4": "All are equal",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "First",
  "explanation": "(i) Equivalent discount\r\n$latex = \\\\left ( 35+5-\\\\frac{35\\\\times 5}{100} \\\\right )\\\\%&s=1$\r\n$latex = 40-1.75 = 38.25%$\r\n(ii) Equivalent discount\r\n$latex = \\\\left ( 30+10-\\\\frac{30\\\\times 10}{100} \\\\right )\\\\%&s=1$\r\n$latex = 40-3 = 37%$\r\n(iii) Equivalent discount\r\n$latex = \\\\left ( 25+15-\\\\frac{25\\\\times 15}{100} \\\\right )\\\\%&s=1$\r\n$latex = 40-3.75 = 36.25%$\r\nNow we can easily say that first discount is best.\r\nHence option [A] is our answer."
