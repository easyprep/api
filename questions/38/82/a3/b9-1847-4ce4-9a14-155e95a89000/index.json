  "question": "In context with the recent discussions on contract farming, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>An intermediary is never involved in contract farming.</li>\n<li>Monopsony is one of the challenges facing contract farming.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nNot all forms of contract farming involve direct contact between the farmer and the buyer. In the intermediary model of contract farming, the buyer (eg: a large farm) subcontracts an intermediary to engage farmers to produce certain crops with specific quality requirements. This intermediary can be a farmer organisation, a collector, etc.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:        </strong>\nOne of the challenges facing contact farming is the issue of monopsony. In a monopsony, the sellers of a product are many but the buyer is usually a single entity. This can be a limit on how much price the farmers can get for their produce."
