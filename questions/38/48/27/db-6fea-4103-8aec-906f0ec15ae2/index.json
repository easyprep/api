The guided bomb achieved the desired range and hit the target with high precision. The weapon system is capable of carrying different warheads. The test firing of the guided bomb came two days after the Indian Air Force (IAF) successfully test fired the aerial version of the supersonic BrahMos cruise missile from a Sukhoi jet at the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  The 2.5 tonne air-to-surface missile has a range of around 300 km, and it will significantly enhance the IAF\\'s combat capability. The BrahMos cruise missile travels at a speed of Mach 2.8, nearly three times that of sound."
