  "question": "Which of the following is / are objective(s) of creating dimples on the golf balls?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>to induce turbulence</li>\r\n<li>to induce drag</li>\r\n<li>to reduce turbulence</li>\r\n<li>to reduce drag</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 & 2",
  "option2": "2 & 3",
  "option3": "3 & 4",
  "option4": "1 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 & 4",
  "explanation": "The dimples act as “turbulators” — they induce turbulence in the layer of air next to the ball (the “boundary layer”). In some situations, a turbulent boundary layer reduces drag."
