  "explanation": "<strong>Young soil with little development - Correct</strong> <br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>This is a correct feature because Taiga soil lacks deep, organically enriched profile present in temperate deciduous forests. The thinness of the <strong>soil</strong> is due largely to the cold, which hinders the development of soil.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Rich in Nutrients</strong> <strong>– Incorrect</strong> <br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>This is incorrect. Taiga soil is poor in nutrients in comparison to the temperate deciduous forests. This is because the fallen leaves and moss can remain on the forest floor for a long time in the cool, moist climate. This would result in poor organic contribution to the soil.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Rich with soil organisms – Correct</strong> <br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>This is correct. The diversity of soil organisms in the boreal forests (southern Taiga) is comparatively higher and such soil is dominated by microscopic fungi. These microscopic fungi play an important role in the decomposition of the dead phytomass.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Acidic – Correct </strong> Taiga soil is acidic due to the falling pine needles. Since the soil is acidic, the acidity aids in the decomposition of the mineral components and the minerals are washed away in the lower horizons. This becomes accessible to the tree roots. This causes infertility of the soil. The leaching of the nutrients , along with the permeability of the soil gives it a light colored eluvial soil horizon leached of most base forming cations such as Calcium. Since the soil is acidic due to the falling pine needles, the forest floor has only lichens and some moss growing on it."
