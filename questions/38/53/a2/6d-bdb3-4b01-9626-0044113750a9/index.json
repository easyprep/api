  "question": "In context with the recent discovery about Chalukyan architecture, consider the following statements about the Deccan Style:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is a combination of Dravidian and Nagara style of architecture.</li>\n<li>In this architectural style, the superstructure over the sanctum is always taller than all the other surrounding towers.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Deccan style is also known as the Vesara style. This is in recognition of its hybrid nature. It is a combination of the Dravidian style and the Nagara style of architecture. In Pattadakal, there are 4 temples in Nagara style (eg: Papanatha Temple) while the remaining 6 are in Dravidian style (eg: Virupaksha Temple).\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nOne of the distinctive features of the Vesara or Deccan style is that the superstructure over the sanctum is shorter than the northern tower. The superstructure is also pyramidal in shape. The northern Shikara tower tends to be taller. The superstructure has steps like in the southern styles."
