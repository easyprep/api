The temple is named after the sculptor Ramappa, who built it and is perhaps the only temple in India to be named after a craftsman who built it rather than the king who commissioned it or its presiding deity. <strong>The temple is located in a valley at Palampet village,near Warangal, Telangana. </strong>An inscription in the temple dates it to the year 1213 AD, during the period of the Kakatiya Dynasty rule. The historic Ramappa temple may soon be declared a World Heritage Site as it is the only nomination sent to UNESCO by India for the year 2019."
