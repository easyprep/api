  "option3": "Only 1, 2, 3 & 5",
  "option4": "Only 1, 3 & 5",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1, 3 & 5",
  "explanation": "In order to reduce air pollution, Supreme Court suggested installation of catalytic convertor in diesel vehicles. The device will help to reduce: <ul> <li>Carbon monoxide (a poisonous gas);</li> <li>Nitrogen oxides (a cause of smog and acid rain); &amp;</li> <li>Hydrocarbons (a cause of smog)</li> </ul> These are converted into less harmful compounds before leaving the carâ€™s exhaust system. This is accomplished using a catalyst, which gives the device its name. The catalyst used in a catalytic converter is a combination of platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and rhodium (Rh)."
