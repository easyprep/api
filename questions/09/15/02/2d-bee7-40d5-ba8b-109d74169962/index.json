It is a mature, passionate, intensely political book of stories, made up of the very stuff of life. Recently, the book is in news because the Jharkhand government has banned the book on the grounds that it portrayed the Santhal women in a bad light. The writer himself belongs to the Santhal adivasi community, which is numerically among the largest indigenous groups. Shekhar won the Sahitya Akademi Yuva Puruskar in 2015 for his novel ‘The Mysterious Ailment of Rupi Baskey’."
