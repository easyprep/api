  "question": "Which international organisation has released the 2019 global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)?",
  "option1": "WHO",
  "option2": "UNDP",
  "option3": "FAO",
  "option4": "ILO",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "UNDP",
  "explanation": "The 2019 global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) has recently released by UN Development Programme (UNDP), the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI). As per the report, India lifted 271 million people out of poverty between 2006 and 2016 & recorded the fastest reductions in the MPI values during the period with strong improvements in areas such as assets, cooking fuel, sanitation and nutrition.  The global MPI tracks 101 countries on deprivations across 10 indicators in health, education, and standard of living. The report underscored that the traditional concept of poverty is outdated, demonstrating more clearly than ever that labelling countries – or even households – as rich and poor is an oversimplification. The report also highlighted a positive trend that those furthest behind are moving up the fastest. The multi-dimensionally poor means that poverty is defined not simply by income, but by a number of indicators, including poor health, poor quality of work and the threat of violence."
