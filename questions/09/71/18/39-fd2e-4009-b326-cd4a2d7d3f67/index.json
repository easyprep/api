The U.S. and a coalition of six Caribbean nations invaded the island nation of Grenada, 160 km north of Venezuela. Codenamed Operation Urgent Fury by the U.S. military, it resulted in a military occupation within a few days. It was triggered by the strife within the People's Revolutionary Government which resulted in the house arrest and execution of the previous leader and second Prime Minister of Grenada Maurice Bishop. The invasion resulted in the appointment of an interim government, followed by democratic elections in 1984. The country has remained a democratic nation since then.",
