  "question": "BCG vaccination is to be given to a new born child after what time?",
  "option1": "Immediately after birth",
  "option2": "Within 48 hours",
  "option3": "Within seven days",
  "option4": "Within six months",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Immediately after birth",
  "explanation": "Bacillus Calmette Guérin or BCG is usually given around birth to prevent severe TB in infants. The neonatal immune system is immature. Delaying BCG vaccination from birth to 10 weeks of age would enhance the vaccine-induced immune response. The BCG vaccine is an injection given to children who have a higher risk of catching TB. The BCG vaccine helps your child\\'s immune system fight the germs that cause TB and helps stop them from getting serious TB disease."
