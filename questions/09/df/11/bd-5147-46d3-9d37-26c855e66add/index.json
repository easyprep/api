  "question": "The total internal reflection occurs when light travels in which of the following situations?",
  "option1": "A rarer medium to a denser medium",
  "option2": "A denser medium to a rarer medium",
  "option3": "A rarer medium to a denser medium and the angle of incidence is less than the critical angle",
  "option4": "A rarer medium to a denser medium and the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "A denser medium to a rarer medium",
  "explanation": "When light travels from one medium to another it changes speed and is refracted. For total internal reflection to occur the light must travel from a dense medium to a less dense medium (e.g. glass to air or water to air). As the angle of incidence increases so does the angle of refraction."
