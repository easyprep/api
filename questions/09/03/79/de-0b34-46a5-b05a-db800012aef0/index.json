  "question": "Who  held that the authority of a Sovereign is beyond any challenge?",
  "option1": "John Locke",
  "option2": "Machiavelli",
  "option3": "Thomas Hobbes",
  "option4": "Rousseau",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Thomas Hobbes",
  "explanation": "Thomas Hobbes argued that the state was the  product of the will of the people and because sovereignty is an attribute of the state; its character must be determined by the terms of social contract. In state of nature men surrender all their natural rights to the sovereign and this surrender is complete, final and irrevocable. Therefore, defying the authority of the sovereign would mean reversion to the state of nature which was the state of anarchy. Hence, he places authority of the sovereign beyond any challenge"
