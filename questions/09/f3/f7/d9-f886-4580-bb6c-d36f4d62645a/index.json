  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "The term \\'Linguistic Minority\\' has not been defined in the Constitution. A group or groups of people whose mother languages are different from the principal language(s) of the State/U.T. broadly constitute the linguistic minority. The Supreme Court <em><u>in DAV College Vs. State of Punjab (1971)</u></em> said, \\\"A linguistic minority for the purpose of Article 30(1) is one which must at least have a separate spoken language. It is not necessary that the language should also have distinct script for those who speak it so as to be a linguistic minority.\\\""
