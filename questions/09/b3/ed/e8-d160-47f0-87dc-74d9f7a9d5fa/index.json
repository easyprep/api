  "question": "A Bluntnose Sixgill Shark was tagged from a submarine for the first time ever by a research team. In this context, consider the following statements this shark:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It is found only in the Indian Ocean.</li>\r\n<li>The shark is listed as an endangered species by IUCN.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe shark usually lives in the ocean depths and along the ocean floor and is hence difficult to study. The shark, also called the cow shark, is found in tropical and temperate regions of Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe shark is listed as ‘near threatened’ by IUCN. It faces threat from fishing for sports and foods. It is also threatened by by-catches. The shark was satellite tagged from a submarine for the first time. This will enable scientists to study it in great depths."
