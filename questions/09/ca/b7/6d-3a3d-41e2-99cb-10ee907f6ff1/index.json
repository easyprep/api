  "answer": "Southwest monsoon",
  "explanation": "The period June to September is referred to as the \\'Southwest Monsoon\\' period. This is the summer monsoon period where the southwest monsoon holds away over the country. The whole country receives nearly 75% of its rainfall during this period. <br />The Western Ghats are the first highlands of India that the southwest monsoon winds encounter. The Western Ghats rise abruptly from the Western Coastal Plains of the subcontinent, making effective orographic barriers for the monsoon winds. The Himalayas play more than the role of orographic barriers for the monsoon.\r\n&nbsp;"
