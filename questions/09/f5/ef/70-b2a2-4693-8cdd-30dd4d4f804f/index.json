  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1, 2 & 4",
  "explanation": "Statement 3 is not correct. Gandhi as well as other top Congress leaders were arrested. All Congress Committees were banned. The sudden removal of all the prominent leaders produced a terrible explosion of popular feelings. They were mass repulses and disorders in almost every part of the country and these took a very serious turn at Midnapur and other eastern districts of the United Provinces. The repressive measures spread a wave of violence throughout the country. On account of the lack of guidance of the leaders, the people adopted violent means for the attainment of independence. \r\nThe government buildings were destroyed. Except the <u>Communist Party</u> (however trade union workers participated on their own) and the Muslim League almost all the parties of the country took active part. JP Narayan, RM Lohiya, Aruna Asaf Ali made significant contribution in the movement of 1942. Considerable Government property was destroyed by the people. Crowds gathered in cities and rural areas and attacked what seemed 10 them symbols of British power such as police stations, post offices, railways etc. The unarmed and leaderless mobs faced police and military firing on not less than 538 occasions. The Government put down the disturbances with the exceptional ferocity Gandhiji at the age of 73 undertook a fast for three weeks as protest against Government atrocities. There was great anxiety felt all over the country. The Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow refused to listen to the wide spread demand for Gandhiji’s unconditional release and so the three Indian members of the Viceregal Executive Council resigned."
