They are deliberative and advisory in nature. There are 5 zonal councils that were constituted to promote interstate coordination. These are the Northern, Eastern, Western, Southern and Central councils.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nNagaland is not a part of the Northern Zonal Council.
