  "question": "Consider the following observations:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>At higher elevations, green house effect is weaker in comparison to lower elevations</li>\r\n<li>Temperature inversions commonly appear on clear, calm nights</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above is / are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "First statement is true because at high elevations, air temperatures are generally cooler and have a greater dayto- night range. Both effects occur because the thickness and density of the air column above decrease with elevation; therefore, the greenhouse effect is weaker at high elevations. The second statement is correct because in a temperature inversion, air temperature does not decrease with height, but increases instead. Temperature inversions commonly appear on clear, calm nights"
