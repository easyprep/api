  "answer": "Ghana",
  "explanation": "Kakum National Park is an IUCN category II national park, located in the coastal environs of the Central Region of Ghana. Established in 1931 as a reserve, it was gazetted as a national park only in 1992 after an initial survey of avifauna was conducted. The area is covered with tropical forest. The uniqueness of this park lies in the fact that it was established at the initiative of the local people and not by the State Department of wildlife who are responsible for wildlife preservation in Ghana. It is one of only 3 locations in Africa with a canopy walkway and connects seven tree tops which provides access to the forest. The most notable endangered species of fauna in the park are Diana monkey, giant bongo antelope, yellow-backed duiker and African elephant. It is also an Important Bird Area recognized by the BirdLife International with the bird area fully overlapping the park area.",
