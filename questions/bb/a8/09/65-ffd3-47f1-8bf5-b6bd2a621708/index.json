  "question": "The length of the diagonal of a square is 'a' cm. Which of the following represents the area of the square (in sq.cm) ?",
  "option1": "$latex \\frac{a^{2}}{4}&s=1$",
  "option2": "$latex \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}&s=1$",
  "option3": "2a",
  "option4": "$latex \\frac{a^{2}}{2}&s=1$",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "$latex \\frac{a^{2}}{2}&s=1$",
  "explanation": "$latex Side = \\\\frac{Diagonal}{\\\\sqrt{2}}&s=1$ $latex = \\\\frac{a}{\\\\sqrt{2}}&s=1$\r\n$latex \\\\therefore Area = (Side)^{2}&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{a}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\right )^{2} sq.cm = \\\\frac{a^{2}}{2} sq.cm&s=1$\r\nHence option [D] is the right answer."
