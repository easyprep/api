  "answer": "Telangana",
  "explanation": "The Telangana government has launched an innovative programme “Janahitha” to receive complaints from public through a special portal. The programme has kick started in Suryapet district on pilot basis and will be implemented across the state in a phased manner. The aim of the programme is to facilitate the public to submit their complaints on line and get speedy redressal. Besides submitting their grievances, the public can also apply for various welfare schemes through this facility.  The public, instead of visiting offices, can lodge their grievance through different means like portal, e-mail, WhatsApp or dialling the call centre from their homes. In addition, they can also track the status of their complaints. Officials at the district headquarters and Secretariat in Hyderabad will monitor the redressal of complaints and send SMS to the citizens on their status. Negative marks will be given to the officials if they fail to redress the grievances in stipulated time."
