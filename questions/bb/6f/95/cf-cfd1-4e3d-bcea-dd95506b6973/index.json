  "question": "With reference to the government decision to raise the subsidy for sulphur fertilisers, which of the following statements are correct?\n<ol>\n<li>NPKS fertilisers contain sulphur.</li>\n<li>Sulphur is required for protein synthesis in plants.</li>\n<li>Fertiliser management system/ FMS tracks movement of fertilisers in the country.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "2 and 3",
  "option2": "3 only",
  "option3": "1 and 2",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nNPKS fertiliser is composed on Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium and Sulphur. Though sulphur is a secondary nutrient, it is considered the 4<sup>th</sup> macronutrient nowadays- hence the combination. It is one of the 17 essential nutrients for crop growth. The government is subsidising these fertilisers to promote soil health and encourage the reduction in use of urea.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nSulphur is required for protein synthesis in the plant. The amino acids are building blocks of these proteins and their structures require sulphur for proper functioning. Hence sulphur fertilisers are more essential for crops like legumes, oil seeds, etc. Sulphur is also required for chlorophyll production.\n<strong>Statement 3</strong> is correct:\nThe government has FMS for tracking the flow of fertilisers in the Indian market. As they are subsidised, they are liable to pilferage and use by other chemical manufactures. Sulphur fertilisers like NPKS are tracked by mFMS- its mobile version. This version tracks until the last point of sale."
