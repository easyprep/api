  "option2": "‘Khalifa’ was treated as the legal head of the Muslim community",
  "option3": "All the Muslim States in the world used to pay tributes to him",
  "option4": "He used to decide all the cases efficiently",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All the Muslim States in the world used to pay tributes to him",
  "explanation": "KHALIFAH is an Arabic word literally meaning “one who replaces someone else who left or died”. In the context of Islam, however, the word acquires a narrower meaning. The Muslim Khalifa is the successor to Prophet Muhammad’s position as the political, military, and administrative leader of the Muslims. The prophetic role of Muhammad is strictly not included in this definition, as the Qur’an and Hadith clearly state that Muhammad was the last of the prophets. Khilafa is a related Arabic word which, in the context of Islam, is used to denote the government of the Muslim state, of which the Khalifa is the head."
