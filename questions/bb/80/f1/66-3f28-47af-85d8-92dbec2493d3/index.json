  "question": "Which of the following factors affect the lattice energy of an ionic compound?",
  "option1": "Size of the ion",
  "option2": "Charge of the ion",
  "option3": "Both a and b",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both a and b",
  "explanation": "Lattice energy of an ionic compound depends on these factors: (i) Size of the ions: Smaller the size, greater will be the lattice energy. (ii) Charge on the ions: Greater the magnitude of charge, greater the interionic attraction and hence higher the lattice energy."
