  "answer": "Anthony D. Smith",
  "explanation": "The Indian subcontinent has developed three major nation-states. The largest, India, to borrow the terms of Anthony D. Smith, is an example of “polycentric nationalism” and Pakistan and Bangladesh are “ethnocentric” nations founded primarily on religion (Islam) and language (Bengali). All these three kinds of nation-states in our neighbourhood have their own problems in all the three dimensions of democracy, development, and culture— communal and national."
