  "explanation": "On 26 March 1946, a British Cabinet Mission, formulated at the initiative of PM Clement Attlee, arrived in India. It comprised Lord Pethick-Lawrence, the Secretary of State for India, Sir Stafford Cripps, President of the Board of Trade, and AV Alexander, the First Lord of the Admiralty. Viceroy Lord Wavell too was associated with it. On 12 May 1946, British Government’s Cabinet Mission published “Memorandum on States’ Treaties and Paramountcy” that envisaged bringing the political arrangements between the Princely States and the British Crown to an end, and for the rights surrendered by the States—defence, foreign policy and communications—to the British to revert to the States when a new fully self-governing or independent Government or Governments come into being in British India. Thus, with the withdrawal of Paramountcy, the Princely States were to become independent."
