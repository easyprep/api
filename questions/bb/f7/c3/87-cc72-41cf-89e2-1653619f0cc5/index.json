Due to his love for students and focus on promoting education, the United Nations declared his birthday (October 15) as ‘World Student’s Day’ in 2010. December 22 has been declared as the National Mathematics Day. It is celebrated to mark the birth anniversary of Srinivasa Ramanujan. Rashtriya Ekta Diwas (National Unity Day) was introduced by the Government of India to commemorate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhai Patel."
