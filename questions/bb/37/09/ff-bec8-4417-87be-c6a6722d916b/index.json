  "explanation": "Guyana's famous landmark and national monument is \"Umana Yana\". The Umana Yana is a conical palm-thatched hut erected for the Non-Aligned Foreign Ministers Conference in Georgetown, Guyana in August 1972 as a V.I.P. Lounge and recreation centre. It is now a permanent and much-admired part of Georgetown's scenery and is in constant use as an exhibition and conference centre. On April 7, 2001, the Umana Yana, along with the African Liberation Monument, was gazetted as one of Guyana's National Monuments. \"Umana Yana\" is a Wai-Wai word meaning \"Meeting place of the people\".",
