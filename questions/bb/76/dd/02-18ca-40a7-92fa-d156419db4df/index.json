  "question": "The Shanidar Cave, a hotspot for Neanderthal remains, is located in which country?",
  "option1": "Syria",
  "option2": "Iraq",
  "option3": "Tajikistan",
  "option4": "Egypt",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Iraq",
  "explanation": "Shanidar Cave is located in the Kurdistan Region in Iraq in Zagros Mountains. Shanidar Cave was excavated in the 1950s, when archaeologist Ralph Solecki uncovered partial remains of ten Neanderthal men, women and children. Some were clustered together, with clumps of ancient pollen surrounding one of the skeletons. Solecki claimed this showed Neanderthals buried their dead and conducted funerary rites with flowers. The 'flower burial' captured the public imagination, and prompted a reappraisal of a species that -- prior to Shanidar Cave -- was thought to have been dumb and animalistic."
