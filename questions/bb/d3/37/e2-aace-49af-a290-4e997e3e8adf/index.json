  "option3": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Peacock Parachute Spider is also known as Gooty Spider or Gooty Tarantula. It is listed as a critically endangered species by IUCN. Critically endangered species are those that are at threat of extinction. These spiders face threat from the pet industry with the females being more valued because of their longevity.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Gooty Tarantula is endemic to India, which means it isn’t found anywhere else in the world. The species is generally confined to the Eastern Ghats region. Till now, they have been reported to occur naturally only in Andhra Pradesh.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nThey are the only blue species of the Poecilotheria genus. The blue coloration is not due to pigments. It is a structural coloration i.e. the colour is caused by light reflections by the crystalline arrangements in the hairs. The hairs are highly iridescent and change hues when observed from different directions."
