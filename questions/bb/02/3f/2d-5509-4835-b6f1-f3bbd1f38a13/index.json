  "question": "With respect to India’s plans to get its debt instruments included in global bond indices, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Investment limits are considered for inclusion into global bonds indices.</li>\n<li>Index investing is also known as active investing.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe global bond indices are those that measures the value of a market’s bonds. India is looking to get its government bonds and securities in such indices in about 2 years. The firms that operate these indices look at two main criteria for inclusion: relaxation of investment limits and currency convertibility.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nIndia is planning to set up a separate window for encouraging foreign passive investors. This will ease restrictions on these investors. This will focus on index investing which is a passive strategy. Index investing is better than active management in the long-term."
