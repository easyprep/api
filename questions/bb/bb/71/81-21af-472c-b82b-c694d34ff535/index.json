  "question": "In view of the increasing role of cab aggregators like Ola in India, consider the following statements about the Motor vehicles bill, 2019 provisions for it:\n<ol>\n<li>The aggregators will get statutory recognition for the first time.</li>\n<li>They are liable to the provisions of the IT act, 2000.</li>\n<li>Provisions for safety of women using the cabs are included in the bill.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 and 2",
  "option2": "None of the above",
  "option3": "3 only",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 2",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe motor vehicles bill, 2019, passed in the Upper House gives recognition to cab aggregators in India. Till now, such operators existed in a regulatory vacuum and none of the states had any solid regulations governing them. This bill recognises these as ‘digital intermediaries’ that serve as platform for connecting customers with cab drivers.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe cab aggregators are under the provisions of the IT act, 2000. This calls for protection of customer data and also data storage. Violating these terms would invite fines ranging for 5,000 INR per day to 1.5 lakh INR per violation.  Violation of the motor vehicles bill (after passage) will bring in fines ranging from 25,000 INR to 1 lakh INR.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Supreme Court had asked the Parliament to legislate a bill for ensuring safety of women passengers of cabs in July. However, such a provision is yet to be made. The cab aggregators themselves have taken a few measures like introduction of the Panic Button. Ola introduced this feature which links the passenger to the Delhi police. However, uniformity in measures is required."
