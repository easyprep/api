  "explanation": "The Labrador Sea is located in the North Atlantic Ocean. It lies between the Labrador Peninsula of Canada and Greenland Island of Denmark. This marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean is connected to the Baffin Bay via the Davis Strait. This is formed on the geological separation of Greenland plate from the North American Plate. This sea houses the Northwest Atlantic Mid-Ocean Channel, one of the world's largest turbidity current channel systems. It is also a major source of the North Atlantic Deep Water, a cold water mass that flows at great depth along the western edge of the North Atlantic Ocean."
