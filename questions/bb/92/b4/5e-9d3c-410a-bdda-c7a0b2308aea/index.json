  "answer": "1 & 2 Only",
  "explanation": "The&nbsp;basal ganglia are a set of interconnected nuclei in the forebrain. The&nbsp;cerebellums&nbsp;are two rounded structures located besides the medulla. The&nbsp;cerebellum&nbsp;is located behind the top part of the brain stem. The&nbsp;hypothalamus&nbsp;is located just below the thalamus, hence the name. It monitors pleasurable activities such as eating, drinking and sex."
