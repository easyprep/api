  "question": "The competitive devaluation by the countries would badly affect which among the following?",
  "option1": "Exporters",
  "option2": "Importers",
  "option3": "Traders",
  "option4": "Service Providers",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Exporters",
  "explanation": "When competitors devalue their respective currencies, domestic exporters tend to lose out on the price advantage on their exportable as buyers prefer to buy from a cheaper currency. This in turn hurts income as well as the jobs in the export sector and the prospects for the economy. The central bank at such times tries to intervene - buy dollars and create an artificial demand for the dollar, devaluing the value of the rupee in the process and retain some price advantage for the exporter . But buying dollars involves a fiscal cost as the central bank has to pump in equivalent amount of rupees and again mop it up by selling bonds. These bonds need to be serviced by the government. This would in turn worsen the fiscal position"
