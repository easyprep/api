The new acting chairperson will discharge his duties until a regular appointment is made and will take part in selection process of other members of the NGT. However, the Chief Justice Dipak Misra bench made it clear that this appointment is an interim arrangement and shall not be construed to be a final determination of the seniority between Justice Rahim and Justice R S Rathore by the apex court. The bench was informed that Justice Rahim and Justice R S Rathore are the judicial members of the NGT and both were appointed to the NGT on the same date that was 12 January 2016."
