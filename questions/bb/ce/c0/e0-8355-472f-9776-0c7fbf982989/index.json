The HMR project is also the worldâ€™s largest Public-Private Partnership (PPP) project. The Government spent close to Rs. 3,000 crore for land acquisition, road widening and shift of utilities, while L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad (L&TMRH) invested more than Rs. 12,000 crore. The construction is underway in two other routes: Corridor Two - Jubilee Bus Station to Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station (Imlibun)/Falaknuma - 15 km and Corridor Three - Nagole to HiTec City/Raidurg - 28 km. Altogether 72 km of elevated metro line is being built in three dense traffic corridors of the capital."
