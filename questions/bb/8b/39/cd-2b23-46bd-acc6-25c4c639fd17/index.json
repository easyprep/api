  "question": "Which country has topped the 2018 report on patents filed by members of the WIPO’s Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)?",
  "option1": "China",
  "option2": "United States",
  "option3": "Japan",
  "option4": "India",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "United States",
  "explanation": "The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has recently released the 2018 report on patents filed by members of its Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). The United Nations (UN) data shows the United States remained the leading individual country for patent applications in 2018. But on a regional basis, Asia’s surge continued. It’s a sign of innovation shifting from west to east because more than half of all international patent applications filed last year came from Asia. In the main category-the PCT, the US led the way with 56,142 applications, followed by China (53,345) and Japan (49,702). Germany and South Korea came in a distant fourth and fifth, with fewer than 20,000 applications each.  India registered the largest innovation jump of any country last year. Patent applications jumped more than 27% - from 1,583 in 2017 up to 2,013. Chinese telecommunications behemoth Huawei also set new record for the number of patent applications filed a single corporation in one year with 5,405. Patent filings are seen as a measure of the spread of science and technology in a country. Patent protection also provides monopoly rights to the inventor."
