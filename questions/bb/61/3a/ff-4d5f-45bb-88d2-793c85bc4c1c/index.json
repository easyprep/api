  "explanation": "Divers of Great Maya Aquifer Project have discovered world's largest known underwater, flooded cave in Mexico. This cave system is located near the beach resort of Tulum on the Yucatan Peninsula. It is made of two massive underwater caverns (Sac Actun and Dos Ojos, measuring 163 miles and 52 miles, respectively) that are connected. With discovery of this connection, the combined length of Sac Actun-Dos Ojos system stands at nearly 215 miles. This is much larger than Ox Bel Ha cave system (also in Mexico), which stretches 168 miles long and was considered as world's largest underwater cave system.",
