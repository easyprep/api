  "question": "What is the change in the rate constant for a chemical reaction when temperature rises by 10° C?",
  "option1": "The rate constant is constant",
  "option2": "The rate constant is nearly doubled",
  "option3": "The rate constant is nearly halved",
  "option4": "The rate constant becomes four times",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "The rate constant is nearly doubled",
  "explanation": "For a chemical reaction with rise in temperature by 10°, the rate constant is nearly doubled. Most of the chemical reactions are accelerated by increase in temperature."
