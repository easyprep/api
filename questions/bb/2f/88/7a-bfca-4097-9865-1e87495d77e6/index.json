  "explanation": "Sapru Committee in 1945 recommended that the declaration of Fundamental Rights was absolutely necessary, for not only giving assurances and guarantees to the minorities, but also for prescribing a standard of conduct for the legislatures, Government and the Courts. The Sapru Committee envisaged two kinds of rights, namely, justifiable rights and non-justifiable rights. However, the Committee did not suggest a list of Fundamental Rights to be included in the future Constitution. The issue was left to be decided by the Constitution-making body."
