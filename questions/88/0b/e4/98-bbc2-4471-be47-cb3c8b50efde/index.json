  "option3": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The boundary zone when two different type of air masses meet is called a Front. The process of its formation is known as frontogenesis. Differences in terms of tem­perature, humidity, precipitation, cloudiness, and wind direction are experienced along different fronts. Since fronts are formed due to convergence of two air masses of contrasting temperatures and hence contrasting weather conditions are found from north to south or south to north.  <br /><br />Occluded front is formed when cold front over­takes warm front and warm air is completely displaced from the ground surface"
