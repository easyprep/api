  "question": "Consider the following statements with respect to the Coking Coal and the Lignite Coal:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>While Coking Coal is primarily used for metallurgical purpose, Lignite coal is primarily used in power generation</li>\r\n<li>Lignite coal comprises lion’s share of Indian coal</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "<strong>Prime Coking</strong> – Mainly used for metallurgical purpose. <br /><strong>Medium Coking</strong> – Mainly used in steel industry. <br /><strong>Semi Coking –</strong> Mainly in cement, fertilizer and sponge iron industries. <br /><strong>Non Coking Coal:</strong> Non- coking coal comprises lion’s share of Indian coal. Based on Useful Heat Value (UHV), it is classified into grades A to G for commercial use. A to C grades are considered as Superior and are used in cement, fertilizer and sponge iron industries. D to G grade, available in almost in all the coalfields, is considered as Inferior and is mostly used in power sector. <br /><strong>Lignite:</strong> It is commonly known as brown coal and is classified into grades A to C on the basis of Gross Calorific Value as per the requirement of the industries. It is considered as apt fuel for power generation especially due to its low ash content."
