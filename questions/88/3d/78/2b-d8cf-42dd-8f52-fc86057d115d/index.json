  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct. Second statement is incorrect because Yazidis live principally in northern Iraq. Third statement is incorrect because they are Kurdish speaking people. Fourth statement is incorrect because they worship with their faces towards Sun. They are unjustly referred to as &quot;devil worshippers&quot; by their Muslim and Christian neighbours sometimes. Their small community is mainly scattered across northwest Iraq, northwest Syria and southeast Turkey."
