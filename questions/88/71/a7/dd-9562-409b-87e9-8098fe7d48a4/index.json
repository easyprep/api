The other principles are peaceful co-existence, equality and mutual benefit, mutual respect for sovereignty and mutual non-interference in internal matters.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Pachsheel is not a treaty. It was introduced during Zhou Enlai’s visit to India to guide the relations of India. However, it is not binding.
