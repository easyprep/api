  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about atmospheric pressure?<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Pressure Gradient is the change in theÂ rate and direction of pressure</li>\n<li>Close spacing of isobars indicates a steep or strong pressure gradient</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Isobars are lines connecting places having equal pressure. It is measured at any station after being reduced to sea level. Pressure Gradient is the change in the rate and direction of pressure. Close spacing of isobars indicates a steep or strong pressure gradient whereas wide spacing indicates weak gradient."
