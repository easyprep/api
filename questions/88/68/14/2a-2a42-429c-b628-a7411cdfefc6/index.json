Consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>Pashmina is derived from Changthangi goat.</li>\n<li>The Changpa nomadic people rear the Pashmina goats.</li>\n<li>The Pashmina goats are also reared for their meat.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "2 only",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 and 3",
  "option4": "1 and 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 2",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nPashmina is said to be the finest of all goat fibres. It is derived from the Changthangi goat/ Pashmina goat that are indigenous to the Ladakh region. The fibre is obtained by combing, unlike in other goat fibres which are sheared. This is because these goats naturally shed their coat seasonally. The industry faces problems due to duplicate products in market. The BIS standardisation will curb the problem.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe goats are mostly reared by the Changpa/ Champa people. They are semi-nomadic. They are mainly found in the Changthang region of Ladakh. They are pastoralists and rear yak and goat. They are considered scheduled tribe by the Indian Government.Â \n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Pashmina goats are not reared for their meat. The Changpa people rear sheep separately for meat purpose. They have traditionally reared the Pashmina for their wool for making clothes. The high altitude habitat implies harsh winters and these fibres make their clothes warm."
