  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "In Indian philosophy, action or Karma has been divided into three categories, according to their intrinsic qualities or gunas. Here Nishkam Karma belongs to the first category, the Satvik (pure) or actions which add to calmness; the Sakam Karma (Self-centred action) comes in the second rÄjasika (aggression) and Akarma (in-action) comes under the third, tÄmasika which correlates to darkness or inertia. Nishkam karma is performing duty for duty’s sake. Nishkam karma is also the mindfulness in the present moment and not worrying about future."
