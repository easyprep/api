  "question": "Galapagos islands are particularly famous for their influence on Charles Darwin. What was so interesting in Galapagos islands?",
  "option1": "Darwin found out that the DNA structure of some of the species at Galapagos islands is entirely different from the closely related species of other areas",
  "option2": "Darwin found that the populations of Drosophila were subject to reproductive isolation, due to which new species were born there",
  "option3": "Darwin found that the population of Galapagos islands had splits into geographically isolated populations, that helped in formation of new species.",
  "option4": "Galapagos islands made a deepened speculation of Darwin on evolution",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Galapagos islands made a deepened speculation of Darwin on evolution",
  "explanation": "Island genetics, the tendency of small, isolated genetic pools to produce unusual traits, has been observed in many circumstances, including insular dwarfism and the radical changes among certain famous island chains, for example on Komodo. The Galápagos islands are particularly famous for their influence on Charles Darwin. During his five weeks there he heard that Galápagos tortoises could be identified by island, and noticed that Finches differed from one island to another, but it was only nine months later that he reflected that such facts could show that species were changeable. When he returned to England, his speculation on evolution deepened after experts informed him that these were separate species, not just varieties, and famously that other differing Galápagos birds were all species of finches. Though the finches were less important for Darwin, more recent research has shown the birds now known as Darwin&#8217;s finches to be a classic case of adaptive evolutionary radiation"
