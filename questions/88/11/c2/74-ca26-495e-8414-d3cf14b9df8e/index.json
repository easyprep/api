  "answer": "All of above correct",
  "explanation": "Sir Richard Stafford Cripps (1889â€“1952) arrived in Delhi on 22 March 1942 along with his team. Cripps was a Labour MP, the leader of the House of Commons, and a member of the British War Cabinet. He had brought with him a new constitutional scheme approved by the British Cabinet. In return, the British sought co-operation in the war-efforts. The team spent three weeks in India in March and April 1942, and had prolonged discussions with the concerned parties. The mission was sent to under the pressure from President Roosevelt of the USA and President Chiang Kai Shek of China. The aim was to secure the active cooperation of Indians in war by promising constitutional reforms, Dominion Status and a constitution making body after the war whose members would be elected by the provincial assemblies and nominated by the Princely States. It also had one clause (Secession Clause) that any province which do not accept the constitution has right to secede. This clause was basically what led to its failure."
