  "question": "What is / are the objectives of using tubeless tyres in the aircrafts?<br> 1. To reduce chances of detatching the tyre from the rim<br> 2. To make them withstand shocks better<br> 3. To allow them withstand heat Select the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The aircraft tyre needs to accelerate from standstill to a high speed instantaneously and may have a significant crosswind offset load, so there&#8217;s a high probability of detatching the tyre from the rim. Further, there are several advantages of tubeless tyres as follows: <ul> <li>Maintenance of air pressure</li> <li>Puncture proof</li> <li>They can withstand shocks etc better</li> <li>Heat is produced during landing. As there is no tube, there is no possibility of the tube stretching</li> <li>An air-retaining lining is provided between tyre and steel rim which does not have spokes or holes.</li> </ul>"
