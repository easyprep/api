  "question": "Which North American country has decided to ban single use plastics from 2021?",
  "option1": "Canada",
  "option2": "Mexico",
  "option3": "United States",
  "option4": "Cuba",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Canada",
  "explanation": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has recently announced that  harmful single-use plastics will be banned in the country from 2021 to reduce ocean waste. He declared it a global challenge to phase out the plastic bags, straws and cutlery clogging the world\\'s oceans. Currently less than 10% of plastic used in Canada gets recycled. The Canadian government said that one million birds and over 100,000 sea mammals worldwide are injured or die each year when they mistake plastic for food or become entangled. Single-use items represent some 70% of the plastic waste littering the marine environment. Canada\\'s move follows one by the European Union (EU), which late last year announced a similar ban. Canada, France, Germany, Britain and Italy, along with the European Union, subscribed at 2018 G7 summit in Quebec to a new charter against pollution in the world\\'s oceans. The non-binding Ocean Plastics Charter called on participating countries and the EU to commit to making all plastics reusable, recyclable or recovered by 2030."
