  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Exclusive Economic Zones refer to the area from the edge of the territorial sea out to 200 nautical miles from the baseline. In this area, the country has sole exploitation rights over all natural resources. The most important reason to introduce EEZ was to halt the clashes over the Fishing Rights and Oil Rights. In the EEZ, the foreign vessels have freedom of navigation and over flight, subject to the regulation of the coastal states. Foreign states are allowed to lay submarine pipes and cables."
