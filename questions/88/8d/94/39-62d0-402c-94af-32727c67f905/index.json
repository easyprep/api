  "question": "What happens to the time period of the simple pendulum if the solid bob is replaced by a hollow sphere of same radius but half the mass?",
  "option1": "time period becomes double",
  "option2": "time period remains unchanged",
  "option3": "time period becomes half",
  "option4": "time period becomes four times",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "time period remains unchanged",
  "explanation": "Time period of simple pendulum is independent of mass of the bob. Therefore, If the solid bob is replaced by a hollow sphere of same radius but different mass, time period remains unchanged."
