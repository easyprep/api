  "answer": "Ecuador",
  "explanation": "Ciudad Mitad del Mundo is the Spanish version of Middle of the World City which signifies the cultural heritage of Ecuador. It is a tract of land located in the Pichincha province of Ecuador. This location houses two important monuments, one, Monument to the Equator, which highlights the exact location of the equator (from which the country takes its name) and commemorates the eighteenth-century Franco-Spanish Geodesic Mission which fixed its approximate location; they also contain the Ethnographic Museum Middle of the Earth, a museum about the indigenous people ethnography of Ecuador. The monument was built to commemorate the first Geodesic Mission of the French Academy of Sciences, led by Louis Godin, Pierre Bouguer and Charles Marie de La Condamine, who, in the year 1736, conducted experiments to test the flattening at the poles of the characteristic shape of the Earth, by comparing the distance between a degree meridian in the equatorial zone to another level measured in Sweden."
