  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "On 27th January, 2005 the Government decided to constitute a &#8220;National Investment Fund&#8221; (NIF) into which the realisation from sale of minority shareholding of the Government in profitable CPSEs would be channelized. The Fund would be maintained outside the Consolidated Fund of India. The income from the Fund would be used for the following broad investment objectives: investment in social sector projects which promote education, health and employment. Capital Investment in selected profitable and revivable Public Sector Enterprises that yield adequate returns in order to enlarge their capital base to finance expansion/diversification. In view of difficult economic situation caused by the global slowdown of 2008-09 and a severe drought that was likely to adversely affect the 11th Plan growth performance, Government, in November, 2009, decided to give one time exemption for utilization of proceeds from disinvestment of CPSEs for a period of three years &#8211; from April, 2009 to March, 2013. Disinvestment proceeds during this period would be available in full for investment in specific social sector schemes decided by Planning Commission/Department of Expenditure. The Government on 17 January, 2013 and 21 February, 2013 approved restructuring of the NIF and decided that the disinvestment proceeds with effect from the fiscal year 2013-14 will be credited to the existing ‘Public Account’ under the head NIF and they would remain there until withdrawn/invested for the approved purpose. The <u>approved purposes include</u> recapitalization of public sector banks and insurance companies, subscribing to shares issued by CPSEs, investment in Indian Railways towards capital expenditure, etc. Specifically an amount of over Rs. 15,000 crore realised as disinvestment proceeds during 2013-14 went towards meeting capital expenditure of Ministry of Railways."
