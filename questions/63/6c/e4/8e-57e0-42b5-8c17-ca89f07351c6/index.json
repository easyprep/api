  "question": "“Females are inferior to males,” said Aristotle. Actually, it is not true. The true statement would be that females are different from males. More research is required in this regard. What conclusions can be obtained from the above lines?",
  "option1": "Aristotle was a male chauvinist",
  "option2": "Females may be inferior to males",
  "option3": "Nothing can be said about the superiority of males unless research is done",
  "option4": "Research is required to clearly tell the differences between the males and the females",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Research is required to clearly tell the differences between the males and the females",
  "explanation": "In his Politics, Aristotle saw women as subject to men, but as higher than slaves, and lacking authority; he believed the husband should exert political rule over the wife. Among women\\'s differences from men were that they were, in his view, more impulsive, more compassionate, more complaining, and more deceptive. He gave the same weight to women\\'s happiness as to men\\'s, and in his Rhetoric stated that society could not be happy unless women were happy too. Whereas Plato was open to the potential equality of men and women, stating both that women were not equal to men in terms of strength and virtue, but were equal to men in terms of rational and occupational capacity, and hence in the ideal Republic should be educated and allowed to work alongside men without differentiation, Aristotle appears to have disagreed."
