  "question": "&nbsp;Consider the following statements about the Chikungunya: <ol> <li>It can be transferred from human to human only by mosquitoes&nbsp;</li> <li>Indian&nbsp;scientists have developed&nbsp;a low-cost vaccine&nbsp;VPM1002 to prevent chikungunya</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "First statement is incorrect because the disease can be transferred from human to human by mosquitoes as well as through monkeys, birds and cattle. The females of&nbsp;Aedes Aegyptii&nbsp;and&nbsp;Aedes albopictus&nbsp;are the main species of mosquito that spread the disease.&nbsp;Second statement is incorrect because there is no vaccine for chikungunya. Treatment is mainly symptomatic such as giving painkillers to relieve the joint pain. VPM1002 is intended to replace the current&nbsp;BCG vaccine to protect people against&nbsp;TB."
