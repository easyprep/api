  "question": "The product of two numbers is 216.  If the HCF is 6, then their LCM is :",
  "option1": 46,
  "option2": 48,
  "option3": 36,
  "option4": 76,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 36,
  "explanation": "Let the numbers be 6x and 6y where x and y are prime to each other.\r\n$latex \\\\therefore 6x \\\\times 6y = 216$\r\n$latex => xy = \\\\frac{216}{6\\\\times 6} = 6&s=1$\r\n$latex \\\\therefore LCM = 6xy = 6 \\\\times 6 = 36$\r\nHence option [C] is the right answer."
