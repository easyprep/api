  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The MoEF had launched an Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project by establishing a Society of Integrated Coastal Management (SICOM). Under this project, SICOM would be implementing the four components viz. National Coastal Management Programme; ICZM-West Bengal; ICZM-Orissa; &amp; ICZM- Gujarat. More focus has been laid on the east coast of India than on west coast because the east coast is more vulnerable than the west coast on account of its low lying nature. The project is funded by the World Bank."
