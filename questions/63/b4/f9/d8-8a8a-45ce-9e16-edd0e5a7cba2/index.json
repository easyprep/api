  "answer": 0.12,
  "explanation": "Let the original price be x Rs. \r\n$latex = \\\\frac{80}{100}\\\\times x = \\\\frac{4x}{5}Rs. &s=1$\r\n$latex SP = \\\\frac{4x}{5}\\\\times \\\\frac{140}{100} = \\\\frac{28x}{25}Rs.&s=1$\r\nGain on original price = \r\n$latex \\\\frac{28x}{25} - x = \\\\frac{3x}{25}&s=1$\r\n$latex \\\\therefore Gain \\\\%= \\\\frac{3x}{\\\\frac{25}{x}\\\\times 100} = 12\\\\%&s=1$\r\nHence option [B] is the right answer."
