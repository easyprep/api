  "question": "With reference to the recent incidence of mob lynching, consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>NCBR records an increase in mob lynching incidence in the country.</li>\n<li>The high level Gauba committee suggested inclusion of provisions against mob lynching in the IPC.</li>\n<li>UN report to its Human Rights Council reported an increase in hate crimes in India.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "2 only",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 and 3",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nNCRB/ National Crime Record Bureau does not contain a separate category for mob lynching cases. Casualties of such cases are recorded as murdered victims. Hence a data on the issue’s trend in India is lacking.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nIn 2018, SC asked the government to take measures and legislate to curb the incidence of mob lynching. Post this directive, the government had constituted 2 committees- one headed by the Union home minister and the other by Union minister Rajiv Gauba. The committee invited discussions with a wide cross section of people and arrived at a report. Inclusion of provisions under the IPC and CrPC was one of the suggestions. It also called for curbing of fake news and use of social media to instigate such violence.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe UN human rights chief Bachelet had reported to the UN Human Rights Council that India is seeing an increase in hate crimes. Hate crimes are not recognised as specific offence in India. Amnesty International’s India Chapter also reported along similar lines. The reports were based on English and Hindi media reports."
