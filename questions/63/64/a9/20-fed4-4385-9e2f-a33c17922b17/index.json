  "explanation": "Rolling plan is a plan which is designed to continue over a period of time and is subject to regular review and updating. The Janta Government terminated the fifth five year plan in 1977-78 and launched its own sixth five year plan for period 1978-83 and called it a Rolling Plan. <br />The main advantage of the rolling plans is that they are flexible. They are able to overcome the rigidity of fixed five year plans by revising targets, projections and allocations as per the changing conditions in the country\\'s economy."
