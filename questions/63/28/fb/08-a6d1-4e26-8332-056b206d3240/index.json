  "answer": "Prakriti",
  "explanation": "Prakriti has been inducted as the first direct-entry combat officer in the border guarding force, ITBP. She has a bachelor\\'s degree in electrical engineering and is right now based in an ITBP unit in Uttarakhand\\'s Pithoragarh. She will soon join the Officers\\' Training Academy of the force in Dehradun. The Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) force is the last of the CAPFs to induct women officers in combat roles after the government first allowed it to enroll them in 2016. The force already has women in combat roles but only in the constable ranks. The ITBP, that guards the 3,488 km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China, was raised in 1962 in the aftermath of the Chinese aggression. Two other forces -- the Border Security Force (BSF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) -- were allowed to directly induct women officers in 2013 and 2014 respectively."
