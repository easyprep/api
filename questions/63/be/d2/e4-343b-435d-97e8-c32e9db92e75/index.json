  "answer": "Disguised unemployment",
  "explanation": "Disguised unemployment is a situation when too many people are engaged in doing a particular task even if not required. This type of unemployment is most common in agriculture sector. A disguisedly unemployed person is the one who seems to be employed but actually he is not. His contribution to the total output is zero or negligible. When more people are engaged in a job than actually required, a state of disguised unemployment is created. It is mostly seen in rural areas."
