  "question": "Which of the following features of DNA makes in uniquely suited to store and transmit genetic information from generation to generation?",
  "option1": "Complementarity of the two stands",
  "option2": "Double helix",
  "option3": "Number of base-pairs per turn",
  "option4": "Sugar-phosphate backbone",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Complementarity of the two stands",
  "explanation": "Complementary base pairing in the DNA double helix (with its complementary DNA strands) describes the manner in which deoxyribose- nucleotides bind to each other. Essentially it means that the bases are arranged along the molecule such that the chains fit together snugly so as to be lightly secured by hydrogen bonds."
