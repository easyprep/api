  "question": "Which among the following is / are correct statements with reference to Black Carbon? 1. Black carbon is directly emitted in the atmosphere as fine particles PM<br> 2.5 2. Black Carbon emissions are largely done from automobile sources 3. Soot is the major component of Black Carbon Select the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Black Carbon is formed as a by-product of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, bio-fuels and biomass. It is the strongest absorbent of light amongst all the components of particulate matter. <strong>Main Properties of BC:</strong> <ul> <li>It is directly emitted in the atmosphere as fine particles PM2.5.</li> <li>It is highly effective in absorbing solar energy and can absorb million times more energy than Carbon Dioxide.</li> <li>It is formed of pure carbon in several linked forms.</li> <li>It is emitted in two forms-anthropogenic and soot. It is a major component of soot .</li> <li>Climatologically, it is highly active and is known as a climate forcing agent. It adds to global atmospheric heating by reducing the albedo which is the property of snow and ice to reflect sunlight.</li> <li>BC emissions are largely done from automobile sources like diesel engines and other vehicles. This comprises 52% of total BC emissions.</li> </ul>"
