Mr. Raju and another TDP MP Y.S. Chowdary resigned from the Council of Ministers after party supremo and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu decided to pull out his Ministers from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government. Mr. Naidu took the decision after facing relentless attacks from the Opposition for failing to secure special category status for Andhra Pradesh. However, TDP continues to be a part of the NDA."
