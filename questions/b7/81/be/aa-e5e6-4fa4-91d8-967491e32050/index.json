  "question": "In recent times, government data has been registering falling Total Fertility Rates in the country. Which of the following statements about TFR are correct?\n<ol>\n<li>TFR is the average number of children (expected) to be born to a woman during the reproductive span of life.</li>\n<li>Replacement rate is the number of children needed to replace the parents in the population.</li>\n<li>India showed a TFR of 2.2 in 2017.</li>\n<li>Bihar has the highest TFR in India.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 and 2",
  "option2": "1, 3 and 4",
  "option3": "1 and 3",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nTFR is a parameter that will enable the prediction of population growth. It is based on synthetic determination of the average number of children, women in their child bearing years are expected to produce. The TFR is dependent on various factors like financial independence, education, employment opportunities etc.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nReplacement rate is the total fertility rate at which the women produce enough children to maintain population levels. 2.1 is the UN prescribed level for maintaining population. Government data has shown that the rate has fallen below this level in certain states- eg: 1.7 from 1971 levels of 4.1 in urban areas. Even in rural areas, some states have registered a drop, eg: TN and Delhi has 1.6 in its rural populations.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe Sample Registration system of 22 states show that the 2017 TFR is 2.2. Earlier, the TFR was 2.3. It is 10 points above the replacement level. This fall implies that after the 37 year demographic dividend period lapses, the country would face the problems of an ageing population.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is correct:\nBihar has the highest TFR levels among all states. It has a TFR of 3.2. The rates can be understood from the high illiteracy levels among women: about 51% according to 2011 census. But this state too has recorded a fall in TFR from 2005-07 TFR of 4."
