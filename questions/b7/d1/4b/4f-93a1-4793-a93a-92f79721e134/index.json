Human Habitats (buildings) interact with the environment in various ways during their life cycles, from construction to operation and then demolition. GRIHA is a rating tool that helps people assesses the performance of their building against certain nationally acceptable benchmarks. It evaluates the environmental performance of a building holistically over its entire life cycle, thereby providing a definitive standard for what constitutes a “green building”. GRIHA rating system is a 100 point system consisting of 12 criteria categorized under seven sections such as site parameters, maintenance &amp; housekeeping, energy, water, human health &amp; comfort, social aspects, and bonus points. Six of these 12 criteria are mandatory, while the rest are optional."
