  "question": "In context with the onset of the north-east monsoon in October, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The El Nino weakens the north-east monsoon.</li>\n<li>During the winter monsoon’s onset, the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone shifts northwards.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe north-east monsoon is strengthened by the El Nino phenomenon. This is unlike the case for the summer monsoon or the south-west monsoon where a strong El Nino spells a weaker monsoon. The predictions for the 2019 however spells a neutral El Nino.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe ITCZ shifts to the south of Equator. This causes the reversal of the monsoon winds. This leads to the onset of the winter monsoon. The winter monsoon winds blow from the land to the sea, unlike the south-west monsoon.\n&nbsp;"
