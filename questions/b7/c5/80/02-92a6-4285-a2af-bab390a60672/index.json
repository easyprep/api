  "answer": "Hyderabad",
  "explanation": "The Department of Biotechnology (DBT) has decided to fund the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and the National Research Centre on Meat (NRCM) for research on cell-based meat, which can also be called clean meat or cultured meat. It is nutritionally equivalent to conventional meat, and tastes, smells, looks and feels exactly like real meat. The only difference lies in the method of production. The advantage of cell-based meat is that animals won’t be slaughtered. Rather than raising livestock and slaughtering them for meat, cell-based meat is produced through ‘cellular agriculture’, with animal cells being cultivated into meat. This new method of producing meat shows strong promise of revolutionising the food system in terms of tackling pressing global issues such as food security, environmental sustainability and animal welfare. the headquarters of CCMB is located at Hyderabad, Telangana."
