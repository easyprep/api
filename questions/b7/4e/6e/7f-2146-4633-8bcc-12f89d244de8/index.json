  "question": "Which of the following rivers does not form a delta?",
  "option1": "Godavari",
  "option2": "Mahanadi",
  "option3": "Narmada",
  "option4": "Krishna",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Narmada",
  "explanation": "Conditions for delta formation by a river: <ul> <li>The river must have gentle gradient in its lower course</li> <li>The river must carry large amount of sediments along it</li> <li>The coastal plains or area where mouth of river lies should be wide</li> </ul> Though&nbsp;Narmada&nbsp;originates far from Western Ghats and empties into the Arabian Sea, the river flows through a rift valley at a steep gradient which increases its speed. Also, the west coastal plains are less wider than that required for delta formation by Narmada."
