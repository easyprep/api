  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe peace village is located in the DMZ and it houses the military demarcation line (MDL). The village is also called Joint Security Area. The region marks the location of the Korean War’s end in 1953.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe DMZ was formed as a result of an armistice and not a treaty.
