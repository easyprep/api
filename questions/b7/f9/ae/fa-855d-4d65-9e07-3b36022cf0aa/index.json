  "option3": "All are incorrect",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are incorrect",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe industries that make use of forest lands for non-forest purposes are required to pay compensation to the compensatory afforestation fund. This compensation depends on the economic value of goods that the razed forest would have provided. The funds are then transferred to the state governments.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nCAMPA is an ad hoc body that was set up by the Supreme Court of India in 2002 to manage the central pooling of funds. It is to serve as the managing and planning body until a statutory body under the CAMPA Act, 2016 is set up.\r\n<strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe funds are to be used only for environment compensation. These are listed under the CAMPA Act, 2016 and includes forest fire prevention, wildlife management, catchment area treatment, etc. It cannot be used for travelling allowances, salaries, buying office equipment etc. for forest officers."
