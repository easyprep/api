  "answer": "Cretaceous Vulcanicity",
  "explanation": "Deccan traps are formed by the outpouring of  lava from many linear fissures developed in the earth’s crust. This outpouring was of quiet type and that is why it did not create any volcanic domes. It just spread across the surface. This incident started 66.25 million years ago (End of the Cretaceous period) when India was near present placed Madagascar and during its movement towards north, it passed over Reunion Hotspot. Presently this hotspot is dormant in nature.</span>"
