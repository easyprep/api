The Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the World Bank were part of this approval process under the \"Georgia – Protected Areas Development Project\". Plants conserved in the park are pine groves and birch groves. The Tusheti Protected Areas includes Tusheti National Park, Tusheti Protected Landscape and Tusheti Strict Nature Reserve.

The park was named one of the \"12 best places you’ve never heard of\" by BudgetTravel in 2011 not only for its rich biodiversity but also for its aesthetic terrain, hamlets, old defence towers, cuisine, and folk culture."
