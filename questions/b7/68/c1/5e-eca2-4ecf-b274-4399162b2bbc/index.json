This loan will help India to reach its goal of reducing stunting in children of the age 0-6 years from 38.4% to 25% by 2022. The POSHAN (PM's Overarching Scheme for Holistic Nourishment) Abhiyaan was launched by Prime Minister on 8th March 2018 at Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan. POSHAN Abhiyaan's main objective is gradual increase of the interventions supported by the World Bank assisted Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Systems Strengthening and Nutrition Improvement Project (ISSNIP) to all districts in India for a 3-year period. This loan will support the first phase scale up to 315 districts and union territories (UTs) in India. The coverage and quality of ICDS nutrition services for pregnant and lactating women and children under 3 years of age will be improved. The project will also ensure convergence of all nutrition related schemes and offer performance based incentives to states and community nutrition and health workers, with focus on results.",
