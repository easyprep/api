  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Siraj ud Daula succeeded Alivardi Khan (Maternal grandfather) as the Nawab of Bengal in 1756 when he was 23. He lost the Battle of Plassey on 23 June 1757 due to the betrayal of Mir Jafar (Commander of Nawab's army). He is considered to be the last independent Nawab of Bengal. Siraj Ud Daulah was offended due to the misuse of Dastak which was granted by Farrukhsiyar in 1717. Even the British humiliated his ambassador Narayan Das. In the year 1756 (4th June), Siraj first captured the Kashimbajar Kuthi. On 20th June 1756, he captured Fort William and Calcutta. Roger Drake and some British left Calcutta and took shelter in Falta. It was said on 20th June Siraj killed at least 146 British army by enclosing them inside a small room measuring 4.30 × 5.50 ⁠metres. This incident is known as the “Blackhole Tragedy”. All given statements are corect."
