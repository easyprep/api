  "question": "With reference to the ongoing discussions about land degradation, the slash and burn practice of Nagaland has been highlighted. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Jhum cultivation is the reason for the more than 50% land degradation faced by the state.</li>\n<li>The frequency of the Jhum cycle has increased over the years.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nJhum cultivation is also called slash and burn cultivation. In this process, the farmer levels a forest, uses the timber/ sells it, burns the undergrowth and cultivates on the resultant land. The practice involves shifting of the agricultural field as the land loses its ability to sustain more crops. It is the cause of degradation in Nagaland.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nIn Jhum cultivation, a farmer moves on to new forest lands when the old one is worn out. The old land is left fallow for a number of years before it is cultivated again. This forms the Jhum cycle. Earlier the Jhum cycle lasted 10 to 15 years. However, the increase in population, climate change and other factors have reduced the cycle to 5 years.\n&nbsp;"
