  "question": "Recently, Election Commission disqualified 20 Aam Aadmi Party MLAs for holding “office of profit”. In this context, consider the following statements: <ol> <li>The term “office of profit” is not defined in the Constitution.</li> <li>The final decision whether a person is disqualified or not on grounds of “office of profit” rests with the parliament.</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is correct.</u> The term office of profit has not been defined in the Constitution. However, articles 102 (1) and 191(1) of the constitution give effect to the concept of office of profit. According to Article 102 (1) (a), a person shall be disqualified as a member of Parliament for holding any office of profit under the government of India or the government of any state, “other than an office declared by Parliament by law not to disqualify its holder”. Similarly, Article 191 (1) (a) has a similar provision for the members of state assemblies. Also, under the Representation of People Act 1951, holding an office of profit is grounds for disqualification. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u>. The final decision whether a person is disqualified or not on grounds of “office of profit” rests with the Supreme Court and not with parliament."
