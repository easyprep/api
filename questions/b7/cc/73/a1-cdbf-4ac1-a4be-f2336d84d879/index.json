  "option1": "Nepal and Bhutan",
  "option2": "Nepal and Bangladesh",
  "option3": "Bhutan and Myanmar",
  "option4": "Sri Lanka and Bangladesh",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Nepal and Bhutan",
  "explanation": "According to recent Union Home Ministry communique, Aadhaar cards are now valid travel documents for Indians under 15 and over 65 years travelling to Nepal and Bhutan. Indians other than those in the two age brackets will not be able to use Aadhaar to travel to the two neighbouring countries, for which no visas are needed. Indian citizens going to Nepal and Bhutan donâ€™t need a visa if they have a valid passport, a photo identity card issued by the Government of India (GoI) or an election ID card issued by the Election Commission (EC). Earlier, persons over 65 and under 15 could show their PAN card, driving licence, Central Government Health Service (CGHS) card or ration card, but not the Aadhaar, to prove their identity and visit the two countries."
