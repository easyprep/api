  "question": "Which of the following is the correct statement about heterotrophs?",
  "option1": "They obtain their energy from sunlight, harnessed by pigments",
  "option2": "They obtain their energy by oxidizing organic molecules",
  "option3": "They make organic molecules from CO2",
  "option4": "They obtain their energy by consuming exclusively autotrophs",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "They obtain their energy by oxidizing organic molecules",
  "explanation": "A heterotroph obtains its energy from organic molecules. An autotroph obtains energy from sunlight utilizing pigments including chlorophyll (A) and uses CO<sub>2</sub> and water to make organic molecules. heterotrophs can obtain their energy from ingesting autotrophs, but can also consume other heterotrophs."
