  "question": "With reference to the Ayodhya case being adjudicated in Supreme Court, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Lord Ram is considered as a ‘juristic person’.</li>\n<li>All deities in India are considered as legal persons.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nLord ram is considered as a juristic person. Because of this, the deity counts as a litigant in court. The juristic person means one who is not a natural person i.e., was created artificially. Only within law is such an entity considered as a person and not outside it.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nNot all deities count as juristic persons. For such designation, the deity must have been subject to what is known as pran prathistha or public consecration. The idol of the deity must be installed in a public place for the public at large. This is according to SC ruling in 1969."
