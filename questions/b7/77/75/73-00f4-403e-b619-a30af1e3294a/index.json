  "question": "Which among the following is <strong>not</strong> the ideal condition for the formation of tropical cyclones?",
  "option1": "Large sea surface with temperature higher than 27° C",
  "option2": "Upper divergence above the sea level system",
  "option3": "Presence of the Coriolis force",
  "option4": "High-level cyclonic circulation",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "High-level cyclonic circulation",
  "explanation": "Cyclone is any low-pressure area with winds spiralling inwards. <br />Conditions Favourable for Tropical Cyclone Formation include: <br />Large sea surface with temperature higher than 27° C, <br />Presence of the Coriolis force enough to create a cyclonic vortex, <br />Small variations in the vertical wind speed, <br />A pre-existing weak low-pressure area or <strong>low-level-cyclonic circulation,</strong><br />Upper divergence above the sea level system."
