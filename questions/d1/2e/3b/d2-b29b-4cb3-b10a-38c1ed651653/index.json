  "question": "In a division problem, the divisor is 4 times the quotient and 3 times the remainder. If remainder is 4, then the dividend is :",
  "option1": 12,
  "option2": 30,
  "option3": 36,
  "option4": 40,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 40,
  "explanation": "Remainder = 4\r\n=> Divisor = 3 $latex \\\\times$ 4 = 12\r\nAgain, divisor = 4 $latex \\\\times$ quotient\r\n=> 4 $latex \\\\times$ quotient = 12\r\n$latex => Quotient = \\\\frac{12}{4} = 3&s=1$\r\n$latex => Dividend = 3\\\\times 12 + 4 = 40$\r\nHence option [D] is correct answer."
