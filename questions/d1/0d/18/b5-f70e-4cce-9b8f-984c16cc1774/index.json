  "question": "UNCCD’s Global Land Outlook report predicts that 70% of the forests are at risk of degradation. With reference to this, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Amazon forests have been listed as the most vulnerable to largest permanent forest loss.</li>\n<li>Deforestation is a major cause of loss of soil organic carbon.</li>\n<li>Tropical forests are more prone to deforestation than temperate forests.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe report by the UNCCD has given a list of 11 deforestation fronts. These are the sites that are expected to experience the largest permanent losses of forests. Amazon tops this list. By 2030, 23 to 48 million hectors could be lost. Others on the list are Borneo and Greater Mekong.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe soil organic carbon content is a major contributor to soil health and the soil’s ability to support vegetation. Deforestation is listed as a major reason for dropping soil organic content. It was found that deforestation is faster in the tropics.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nThe tropical forests are more prone to deforestation. About 55% of the temperate forests have been left undisturbed in the previous 2 centuries. But only 1% of the undisturbed forest occurs in Europe. Hence these are very vulnerable to policy missteps."
