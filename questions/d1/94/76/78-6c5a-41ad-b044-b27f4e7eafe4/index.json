  "question": "Which country houses the \"Danube Bend\"?",
  "option1": "Hungary",
  "option2": "Austria",
  "option3": "Slovakia",
  "option4": "Slovenia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Hungary",
  "explanation": "The Danube Bend is a curve of the Danube River in Hungary, close to the city of Visegrad. The Transdanubian Mountains lie on the right bank of the bend, while the North Hungarian Mountains lie on the left bank of the bend. This region is touristically very significant. The landscape and the river attracts a lot of visitors both from the homeland and abroad. The present-day U-shaped loop is probably the result of an eruption of the volcano stretching over the whole area some 15 million years ago.",
