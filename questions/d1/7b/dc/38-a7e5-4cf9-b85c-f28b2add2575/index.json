  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 and 2",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 only",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe islands are located in the Sea of Japan- a marginal sea almost completely enclosed away from the Pacific Ocean. The islands are almost equidistant from Japan and South Korea and has for many years been a bone of contention between the two nations. It has 2 main islands and 35 small islets and rocks.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nWhile the Japanese call these islands Takeshima islands/ ‘bamboo’ islands, the South Koreans call it by a different name. They refer to it as the ‘Dokdo’ island/ isolated island. The island has been contested for historical reasons and also because it possibly holds natural gas reserves.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe island was historically sparsely populated. Currently, the island holds ‘inhabitants’ for propaganda sake. Several Koreans live here so that South Korea can claim the territory due to presence of permanent residents here. The site also allows tourists’ visits."
