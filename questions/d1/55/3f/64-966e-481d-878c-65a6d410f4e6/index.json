  "explanation": "In chemistry, a colloid is a mixture in which one substance of microscopically dispersed insoluble particles is suspended throughout another substance. Sometimes the dispersed substance alone is called the colloid; the term colloidal suspension refers unambiguously to the overall mixture. <br />Fog is an aerosol, a type of colloid consisting of a liquid (water) dispersed in a gas (air)."
