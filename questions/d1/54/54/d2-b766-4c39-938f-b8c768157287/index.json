  "question": "The Kinetic energy of a satellite is maximum in which of the following conditions?",
  "option1": "when the satellite is at perigee",
  "option2": "when the satellite is at apogee",
  "option3": "it is equal at perigee and apogee",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "when the satellite is at perigee",
  "explanation": "The Kinetic energy will be maximum when the satellite is closest to the central body (at perigee) and minimum when it is farthest from the central body (at apogee). Potential energy will be minimum when kinetic energy = maximum i.e., the satellite is closest to the central body (at perigee) and maximum when kinetic energy = minimum i.e., the satellite is farthest from the central body (at apogee)."
