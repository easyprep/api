  "question": "The HCF and LCM of two number are 13 and 455 respectively. If one of the number is lies between 75 and 125, then that number is :",
  "option1": 78,
  "option2": 91,
  "option3": 104,
  "option4": 117,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 91,
  "explanation": "HCF = 13\r\nLet the numbers be 13x and 13y, where x and y are co-prime to each other.\r\n∴ LCM = 13xy\r\n∴ 13xy = 455\r\n$latex \\\\therefore xy = \\\\frac{455}{13} = 35 = 5\\\\times 7&s=1$\r\n∴ Numbers are 13 $latex \\\\times$ 5 = 65 and 13 $latex \\\\times$ 7 = 91\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer"
