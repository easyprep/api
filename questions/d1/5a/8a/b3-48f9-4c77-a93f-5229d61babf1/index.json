The Spartacist uprising, also known as the January uprising, happened as part of German Revolution of 1918â€“1919, was a general strike (and the armed battles accompanying it) in Berlin from 5 to 12 January 1919. The uprising was primarily a power struggle between the moderate Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) led by Friedrich Ebert and the radical communists of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), led by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, who had previously founded and led the Spartacist League. The revolt was improvised and small-scale and was quickly crushed by the superior firepower of government troops."
