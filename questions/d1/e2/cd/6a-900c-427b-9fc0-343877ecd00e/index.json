  "question": "With regards to the newly developed unclonable security ink by the National Physical Laboratory, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It is capable of emitting 2 colors.</li>\r\n<li>It is based on the principle of chemo-luminescence.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe newly developed security ink by the CSIR National Physical laboratory is capable of changing colors when exposed to UV light. On incidence of UV light, the ink exhibits red color while in its absence, appears green in color.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe security ink was developed based on the principles of fluorescence and phosphorescence. In fluorescence, light is absorbed by a compound and emitted back instantaneously. In phosphorescence, the remission process is delayed. In chemiluminescence, light is produced by a certain chemical reaction."
