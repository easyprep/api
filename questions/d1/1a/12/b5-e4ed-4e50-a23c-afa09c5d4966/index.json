  "question": "How many numbers are between 100 to 200?",
  "option1": 100,
  "option2": 101,
  "option3": 99,
  "option4": "None",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 101,
  "explanation": "This question is very easy, here we can get the numbers between 100 to 200 just by this simple calculation, (200-100) + 1 = 101. Here we have added 1 from outside because if in series 100 would  be not added then we will do (200 - 100), but here in quesion 100 is added in our series so we have add 1."
