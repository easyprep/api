  "question": "Recently, the scientists have discovered perfluorotributylamine or PFTBA, which is the <b>radiatively efficient </b>chemical ever. What does the Radiative efficiency measure?",
  "option1": "The capacity to emit radioactive particles",
  "option2": "The capacity to impact climate",
  "option3": "The capacity to transfer heat produced by the device to other devices (coolant)",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "The capacity to impact climate",
  "explanation": "<table width=\"100%\"> <tbody> <tr> <td width=\"100%\"><strong>Radiative Efficiency</strong> Scientists have discovered the most “radiatively efficient” chemical ever—perfluorotributylamine or PFTBA. Radiative efficiency is a measure of a chemical’s capacity to impact climate. Over a 100-year-period, one molecule of PFTBA has the same climate impact as 7,100 molecules of carbon dioxide. PFTBA does not occur naturally and there are no known natural processes to destruct or alter it, hence it has a very long life.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>"
