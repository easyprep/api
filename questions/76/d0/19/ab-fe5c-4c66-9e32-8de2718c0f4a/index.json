  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:<br /></strong> The Araku Arabica coffee was GI tagged earlier in 2019. The coffee is grown on the hilly terrain at an altitude of over 2,000 ft above sea level. The distinctive flavour is attributed to its iron rich soil and favourable weather. <br /><strong>Statement 2 is correct:<br /></strong> The coffee is grown mainly by the Adivasis of the region. It is cultivated in 10 mandals in the region. GI tagging will aid their economic up-liftment. The coffee has been cultivated in the region since the 1900s. <strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:<br /></strong> The Chikmagalur Arabica Coffee was GI tagged at the same time as the Arakku coffee. It is grown in Karnataka. This is the region where coffee was cultivated for the first time in India. Coorg Arabica Coffee is also from this state."
