  "question": "In which of the following seasons milk of the animals fed on grass contains large amounts of fat?",
  "option1": "Summer",
  "option2": "Winter",
  "option3": "Spring",
  "option4": "Autumn",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Summer",
  "explanation": "The milk of the animals contains large amounts of fat in summer season. The decline in fat content of milk from winter to summer is more likely to be due to increase in temperature as it is obvious that when environmental temperature increases the synthesis of fatty acids is decreased especially those fatty acid that do not come directly from blood."
