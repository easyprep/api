  "answer": "Doniger",
  "explanation": "The very positive fact about Hinduism is that it has a diversity of ideas on spirituality and traditions without any ecclesiastical order, religious authorities, or any binding holy book. A Hindu can be polytheistic, pantheistic, monotheistic, agnostic, atheistic or humanist and still be a Hindu which makes it most humane religion."
