But Geographical indications are different from other intellectual property such as copyrights and trademarks in the following ways: <ul> <li>GIs identify a good as originating from a particular place where IPR like trademark identifies a good or service as originating from a</li> </ul> Particular company or invention of a particular person. <ul> <li>Geographical indications are typically used for agricultural products, foodstuffs, wine and spirit drinks, handicrafts, and industrial products where as IPR is given to any new inventions of a particular person or a company</li> <li>GI provides collective protection, if their products qualify, producers can use the collective GI mark while commercially exploiting their products where as IPR which guarantee the protection of individual interests</li> <li>While copyrights and trademarks are monopoly private intellectual property rights, GIs are publicly owned by the artisans or Producers of the concerned product.</li> <li>IPR protects the profits earned from novelty and inventiveness but GI not only protect novelty and inventiveness but also the traditional knowledge and skills associated with certain products, which are typically passed down through generations, and which have a strong link with the underlying geographical territory</li> </ul> Geographical indications (GIs) identify GIs support local production and are an important economic tool for the uplift of rural and tribal communities. <ul> <li>GI tag provides protection to tribals from commercial exploitation of their productions by using fake brand names.</li> <li>Memang narang is a wild Indian orange, which grows in Meghalaya's Garo hills and it is the only region in the world where the fruit is found. It is believed to be the most \\\"primitive\\\" citrus and the ancestor of today's cultivated citrus fruit. GI tag for this type of fruits helps to promote exports.</li> <li>GI acts as a signaling device helping the producers to differentiate their products from competing products in the market and enabling them to build a reputation and goodwill around their products, which often fetch a higher price.</li> </ul>"
