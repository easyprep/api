  "question": "Which of the following reactions represents changing of green colour of ferrous sulphate?",
  "option1": "Double Displacement reaction",
  "option2": "Displacement reaction",
  "option3": "Combination reaction",
  "option4": "Decomposition reaction",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Decomposition reaction",
  "explanation": "A reaction in which a single reactant breaks down to give simpler products is known as decomposition reaction. Ferrous sulphate crystals lose water when heated and the colour of the crystals changes. It then decomposes to ferric oxide, sulphur dioxide and sulphur trioxide."
