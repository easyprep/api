  "question": "Consider the following statements with respect to the moderators used in Nuclear reactions:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Both normal water &amp; heavy water can be used as Moderators in Nuclear reaction</li>\r\n<li>Moderators are used both in Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Bombs</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<p class=\\\"Explanation\\\">Moderator is a medium that reduces the speed of fast neutrons, thereby turning them into thermal neutrons capable of sustaining a nuclear chain reaction involving uranium-235. Commonly used moderators include regular (light) water (roughly 75% of the worldâ€™s reactors), solid graphite (20% of reactors) and heavy water (5% of reactors). Beryllium has also been used in some experimental types, and hydrocarbons have been suggested as another possibility. Moderators are used in nuclear bombs too."
