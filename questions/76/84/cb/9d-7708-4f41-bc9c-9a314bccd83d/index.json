  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Mukna Kangjei is a form of hockey and is also known as the Manipuri Hockey or Khong Kangjei. It originated in Manipur. The term Kang refers to ball, Jei refers to hitting and the term Khong refers to foot. It involves the use of feet and ‘hockey sticks’ made of curved bamboo.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nMukna Kangjei involves the use of physical confrontation of the opponents. Tripping of the opponents is known as ‘collaring’ and is a permitted practice. So is wrestling, which is known as Mukna. It is a team game. The ball is traditionally made of bamboo root."
