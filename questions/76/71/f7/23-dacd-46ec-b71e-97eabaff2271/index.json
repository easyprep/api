  "answer": "Dominica",
  "explanation": "The Scott's Head Peninsula is a saltwater type diving site located in the Scott's Head region of the island country of Dominica, officially the Commonwealth of Dominica, in the Windward Islands of the Lesser Antilles Archipelago. Scott's Head is a small isthmus on the southern tip of the island of Dominica. This spectacular diving starts shallow with long-snout seahorses flitting among the seagrass, then launches into a submerged volcanic crater lined with azure vase sponges. A moderate-level descent, it also includes a swim -through full of lobsters and grunts on the south-west coast of Dominica and the Caribbean Sea."
