  "question": "With reference to a swinging pendulum, which among the following statements is correct when it is at bottom (middle of arc)?",
  "option1": "It has maximum kinetic energy and minimum potential energy",
  "option2": "It has maximum potential energy and minimum kinetic energy",
  "option3": "It has zero kinetic energy",
  "option4": "It has zero total energy",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "It has maximum kinetic energy and minimum potential energy",
  "explanation": "At the lowest point of its motion of swinging pendulum, kinetic energy is maximum and gravitational potential energy is minimum. At the highest point of its motion, kinetic energy is minimum and gravitational potential energy is maximum."
