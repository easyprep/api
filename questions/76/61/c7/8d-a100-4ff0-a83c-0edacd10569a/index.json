  "explanation": "Maldives has conferred \\'Nishan Izzuddin\\' award on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It is the highest award to honour foreign nationals. On June 8, Mr. Modi arrived in Male on the first leg of his two-nation tour to the Maldives and Sri Lanka. This will also be the first bilateral visit to the Maldives of an Indian Prime Minister after 2011.   Mr. Modi will have bilateral discussions with President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, hold meetings with Vice President Faisal Naseem and Speaker of Majlis and former President Mohamed Nasheed during his visit. He will also address the legislative body of the island nation called the People’s Majlis. Along with President Solih, Prime Minister Modi is likely to inaugurate the Coastal Surveillance System (CSS) and the Comprehensive Training Centre for National Defence Forces of Maldives. The two projects have been developed with Indian Grants. India is likely to announce a few new projects to the Maldives including building a cricket Stadium there and renovating the Friday Mosque by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)."
