  "explanation": "This treatment was used since 1960s but only recently getting attention. It is still under experiments and is being refined. In the early 2015, Human clinical trials were started in Liberia to test the effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy (CPT). This question is based on that news. Convalescent plasma was found to effectively treat diphtheria and tetanus at the end of the nineteenth century, and was widely used in the first half of the twentieth century to treat diseases such as measles, mumps and pneumonia. But with the arrival of antibiotics, antivirals and vaccine, convalescent plasma was all but forgotten."
