  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The Bhoodan-Gramdan movement was a part of the larger Sarvodaya movement which aimed for the upliftment of all socio-economic classes. The Bhoodan movement originated spontaneously when Vinobha Bhave was reaching out to peasants in Pochampally village in Telangana. While Bhave was advocating for people to themselves take action where the government was being ineffective in land redistribution, a landlord offered to provide 100 acres to the Harijans of the village. This triggered other landlords also to voluntarily come forward and donate parts of the land to the underprivileged. This movement was very active till the late 1950s. During the later stages, the Gramdan movement gained popularity over the Bhoodan movement. In the Gramdan movement, whole villages were given as gifts in contrast with the Bhoodan movement which consisted of individual land gifts. In Gramdan, the whole village or at least 75% of the population of the village relinquished their rights over land owned by them, and handed it over to the entire village. The land received was then equally redistributed among the families in the village. Land reforms were a major issue in post-independence India. The Bhoodan-Gramdan movement built on Gandhian principles to move the people to action where the government was slow to act."
