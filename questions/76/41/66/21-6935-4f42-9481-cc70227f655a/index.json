  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2, 3 and 4",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Gulf of Thailand is a shallow inlet of the water in the south eastern part of Asia. It is bordered by Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. It is also called Gulf of Siam. It has reduced salinity due to strong inflow of rivers at the Bay of Bangkok, coupled with its shallow depth.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe Gulf of Thailand falls outside the South China Sea territory claimed by China- called the nine dash line. This gulf territory is disputed among Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand and also Malaysia. The islands located in this gulf are disputed among the states. Eg: Koh Tral Island between Vietnam and Cambodia.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThis gulf is a western extension of the South China Sea. The South China Sea is a marginal sea of the Pacific Ocean. It is a significant shipping route as 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of world’s shipping traffic passes through this sea. Mekong is one of the major rivers that drains into this sea.\n<strong>Statement 4 </strong>is correct:\nThe Kra canal or the Thai canal is a proposed project to connect this gulf with the Andaman Sea. It is a part of China’s maritime “21<sup>st</sup> century Silk Road” project. The project is intended in southern Thailand. It will reduce the significance of the Malacca strait, situated to its south."
