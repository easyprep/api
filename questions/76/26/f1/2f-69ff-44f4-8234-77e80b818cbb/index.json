  "question": "Which of the following is not a part of the hydrological cycle? &nbsp;",
  "option1": "Evaporation",
  "option2": "Hydration",
  "option3": "Precipitation",
  "option4": "Condensation",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Hydration",
  "explanation": "The hydrologic cycle begins with the evaporation of water from the surface of the ocean. As moist air is lifted, it cools and water vapour condenses to form clouds. Moisture is transported around the globe until it returns to the surface as precipitation. Once the water reaches the ground, one of two processes may occur; 1) some of the water may evaporate back into the atmosphere or 2) the water may penetrate the surface and become groundwater. Groundwater either seeps its way to into the oceans, rivers, and streams, or is released back into the atmosphere through transpiration. The balance of water that remains on the earth's surface is runoff, which empties into lakes, rivers and streams and is carried back to the oceans, where the cycle begins again."
