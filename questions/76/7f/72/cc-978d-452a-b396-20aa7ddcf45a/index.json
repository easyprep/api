The Conference looked to the Indian National Congress for support, but Congress was reluctant to provide it until 1939, when Jawaharlal Nehru became its president, serving in this position till 1946.<br />• The All-India Muslim League was a political party established in 1906 in the British Indian Empire. The party arose out of a literary movement begun at The Aligarh Muslim University in which Syed Ahmad Khan was a central figure.<br />• The first Indian National Conference was held in Kolkata at Albert Hall from 28 to 30 December 1883."
