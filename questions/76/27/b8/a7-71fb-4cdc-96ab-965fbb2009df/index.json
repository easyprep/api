  "question": "What is the H-C-H bond angle in a methane molecule?",
  "option1": "120°",
  "option2": "75°",
  "option3": "109.5°",
  "option4": "150°",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "109.5°",
  "explanation": "According to VSEPR theory, methane has a tetrahedral structure which is multiplanar, in which carbon atom lies at the centre and the four hydrogen atoms lie at the four corners of a regular tetrahedron. All H-C-H bond angles are of 109.5°."
