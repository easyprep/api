  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 3",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 & 2 Only",
  "explanation": "A day on Jupiter is officially only 9 hours, 55 minutes and 30 seconds long, which means a single day is less than a third the length of an Earth day. This is due to the fact that the planet has a very rapid rotational speed of 12.6&nbsp;km/s at the equator in comparison to earth&#039;s rotational speed of&nbsp;1670 kilometers/hour at equator."
