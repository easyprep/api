  "explanation": "• Beriberi is a disease caused by a vitamin B-1 deficiency, also known as thiamine deficiency. There are two types of the disease: wet beriberi and dry beriberi.<br />• Rickets is a skeletal disorder that\\'s caused by a lack of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate.<br />• Scurvy is a disease resulting from a lack of vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Early symptoms of deficiency include weakness, feeling tired and sore arms and legs.<br />• Vitamin E deficiency has been advocated as a possible cause of infertility in many studies conducted in the past.<br />• Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) or hypovitaminosis A is a lack of vitamin A in blood and tissues. It is common in poorer countries, but rarely is seen in more developed countries. Nyctalopia (night blindness) is one of the first signs of VAD."
