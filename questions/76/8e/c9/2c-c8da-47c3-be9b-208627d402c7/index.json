  "question": "Consider the following characteristics: <ol> <li>Torrential downpour</li> <li>Closed Isobars</li> <li>Anticlockwise movement of air in Northern Hemisphere</li> <li>Thermal Origin</li> </ol> &nbsp;&nbsp; Which of the above are related to temperate cyclones?",
  "option1": "1, 3 & 4 Only",
  "option2": "1, 2 & 3 Only",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 4 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3 Only",
  "explanation": "Temperate cyclones are of dynamic origin and are result of frontogenesis. Tropical cyclones are thermal in origin. Closed circular Isobars with low pressure at centre are features of temperate cyclones. Temperate cyclones are usually V-shaped and the pressure gradient is low."
