  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nDesert locust is a type of grasshopper. It is a major pest of agricultural crops. They are noted for their movement in masses called swarms. They are noted for inhabiting arid zones in Africa and South west Asia. Recently, they have been attacking Kutch, Patan and Banaskantha regions of Gujarat.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe locusts migrate during daytime in swarms. They settle on crops at night and feed on them causing massive losses. Some of their noted attacks occurred in 1986, 1967, etc. The agricultural ministry has a dedicated organisation called Locust Warning Organisation in Jodhpur to deal with the issue."
