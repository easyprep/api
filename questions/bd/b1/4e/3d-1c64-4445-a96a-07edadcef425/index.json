  "question": "Which among the following phenomena has been largely responsible for the recent drought in Somalia and northern Kenya?",
  "option1": "El Nino Southern Oscillation",
  "option2": "La Nina",
  "option3": "Indian Ocean Dipole",
  "option4": "A collective impact of all the above three",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "La Nina",
  "explanation": "In 2010, a strong La Niña cooled surface waters in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, while allowing warmer water to build in the eastern Pacific. The pool of warm water in the east intensifies rains in Australia, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Domino-style, this pattern also increases the intensity of westerly winds over the Indian Ocean, pulling moisture away from East Africa toward Indonesia and Australia. The result? Drought over most of East Africa and floods and lush vegetation in Australia and other parts of Southeast Asia."
