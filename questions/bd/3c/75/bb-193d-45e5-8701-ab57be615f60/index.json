  "option1": "Lime and Gypsum",
  "option2": "Gypsum and Chalk",
  "option3": "Lime and Chalk",
  "option4": "Lime and Urea",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Lime and Chalk",
  "explanation": "Lime (CaO) and Chalk (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) can also be added to neutralize acidity of the soil. It is because CaO and CaCO<sub>3</sub> are basic in nature which can neutralize the acid present in the soil. Gypsum and Urea are used to treat alkaline soil rather."
