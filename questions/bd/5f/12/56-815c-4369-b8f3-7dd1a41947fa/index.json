  "question": "India is conducting its largest ever trial of TB vaccine. Consider the following statements about the program:\n<ol>\n<li>The program seeks to evaluate the performance of BCG vaccine.</li>\n<li>It seeks to evaluate the performance of Immuvac vaccine.</li>\n<li>This is a phase III vaccine trial in thousands of TB patients.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "2 only",
  "option2": "1 and 3",
  "option3": "All of the above",
  "option4": "2 and 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 only",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong> Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nBCG or Bacille Calmette Geurin vaccine is a 100 year old product used around the world for Expanded Program of Immunisation/ EPI. It is partially effective against TB. The problem arises due to its inaction against the multi-drug resistant strains of TB. India has a huge share of patients with multi-drug resistant TB infection. This is what the vaccine trial seeks to address.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe vaccine trial will test 2 products: Immuvac and VPM1002. Both are produced in India. Immuvac is also called MIP (Mycobacterium indicus pranii), produced by Ahmedabad’s Cadila Pharmaceuticals. The VPM1002 is produced by Serum Institute of India in Pune. Depending on the results of this trial conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research, recommendations would be made to the health and family welfare ministry.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nVaccine trials are usually conducted in 3 phases, with each subsequent phase covering larger population sample. The phase III of this drug trial will involve 12,000 individuals who are healthy and are selected from the households of patients who were recently diagnosed with TB. Vaccines are preventive medicine, not curative.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;"
