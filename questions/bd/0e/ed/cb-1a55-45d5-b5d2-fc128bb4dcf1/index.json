  "question": "In recent times, the piezoelectric crystals and ceramics are used in various instruments including mobiles, microphones, electronic oscillators, measuring instruments etc. What are the fundamentals behind so many applications of piezoelectric crystals? <ol> <li>They generate electricity when deformed mechanically</li> <li>They deform mechanically, when an electric currents</li> </ol> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "Piezoelectricity, electricity generated by certain crystals and ceramics when they are deformed by mechanical pressure. The effect is reversible, that is, an electric current can produce deformation in these crystals and ceramics. Crystals showing the piezoelectric effect include quartz and Rochelle salt. The most commonly used piezoelectric ceramic is barium titanate."
