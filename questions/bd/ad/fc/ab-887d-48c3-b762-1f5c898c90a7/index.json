  "option3": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Hybrid Till Model is used to determine the airport charges. Under the hybrid till method, which is currently being used by joint venture airports, only 30 per cent of non-aeronautical revenue is taken towards IRR, allowing the operator to pocket 70 per cent of the non-aeronautical revenue. The idea is to encourage the operators to expand airport infrastructure. Under NCAP 2016 unlimited number of flights to six metro airports namely Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Chennai, was signed with six countries namely Jamaica, Guyana, Czech Republic, Finland, Spain and Sri Lanka.&nbsp; India renegotiated with Saudi Arabia, Ghana and&nbsp;Oman on traffic rights and increasing the capacity."
