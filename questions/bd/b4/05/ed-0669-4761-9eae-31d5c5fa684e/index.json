  "question": "Recently, scientists developed a vaccine for bovine tuberculosis. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Bovine tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</li>\n<li>It affects cattle.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nBovine tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium bovis. This bacterial pathogen is related to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis which causes the typical TB among humans. Recently, scientists in London developed a vaccine for it as affected animals are culled in the UK.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Bovine tuberculosis is a major health issue of cattle, but it can also affect other animals including humans. It can spread through consumption of the infected animalsâ€™ products (meat and milk), especially when unpasteurised. Eradicating TB in India requires eradication of its bovine form also."
