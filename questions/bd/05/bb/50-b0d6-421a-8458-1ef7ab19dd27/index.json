British rule continued until 1974 (except for a period of French rule between 1779 and 1783). From 1958 to 1962 Grenada was part of the Federation of the West Indies, a short-lived federation of British West Indian colonies. On 3 March 1967, it was granted full autonomy over its internal affairs as an associated state. Independence was granted on 7 February 1974 under the leadership of Eric Gairy, who became the first Prime Minister of Grenada.",
