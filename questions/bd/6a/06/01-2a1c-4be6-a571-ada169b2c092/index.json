  "question": "Which of the following is / are correct statements about Clive's dual administration?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It gave rise to immediate conflict between British and Nawab</li>\r\n<li>It led to Anglo Maratha clash</li>\r\n<li>It separated power from responsibility</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "The first two statements should be reversed to understand what happened exactly. Since there was a dual administration in place, it clearly defined the respective position of the Nawab and the East India Company. This left no chance of near future conflicts between the two. Further, the direct assumption of responsibility of administration of English Company might have to come in conflict with the rising power of the Marathas. Third statement is correct. The system separated power from responsibility. The English got the right of collecting the revenue but they had no responsibility for the internal administration. The condition of Bengal worsened on account of the double government. The famine of 1770 and the epidemic that followed accounted for one third of population of Bengal. The English Company did nothing for the relief of the people and remained a silent spectator to the appalling distress of the people. The dual system which deserved all possible condemnation was finally<br />abolished by Warren Hastings in 1772."
