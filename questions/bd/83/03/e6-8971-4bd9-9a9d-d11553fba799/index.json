  "question": "Who said that - India is an indestructible Union of destructible states?",
  "option1": "Jawaharlal Nehru",
  "option2": "B R Ambedkar",
  "option3": "B N Rau",
  "option4": "Dr. Rajendra Prasad",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "B R Ambedkar",
  "explanation": "Article 1(1) of the constitution of India says that \"India, that is Bharat, shall be Union of States\". The word Union was deliberately chosen in place of Federation to indicate that Indian Union is not the result of an agreement between states (which can be broken at whim) and its component states have no freedom to secede from it. Thus, while states can be broken, reorganized by alternation of boundaries, the country is a union which cannot be broken. Central Government can change the name, boundaries of the states without their permission also. That is why Dr. B R Ambedkar called India as an \"indestructible Union of destructible states\"."
