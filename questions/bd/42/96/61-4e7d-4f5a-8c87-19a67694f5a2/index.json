  "explanation": "The National Hindi Day (NHD) is celebrated every year on September 14 across India to mark the language that roots back to Ancient India, in which the scriptures of the Land of Saints and Yogis, Mythological Epics and Glory of various Kingdoms and Dynasties were written. On this day, in 1949, the Constituent Assembly of India had adopted Hindi written in Devanagari script as the official language of the Republic of India. On 2017 NHD, the President of India Ram Nath Kovind presented Rajbhasha awards for the Year 2016-17 at a function in Rashtrapati Bhawan, New Delhi. The Rajbhasha awards were instituted by the Department of Official Language to recognize the excellent contribution of Ministries, Departments and Nationalized Banks in the field of Hindi."
