  "answer": 1985,
  "explanation": "TADA was the first anti-terror law enacted in 1985. It was first enacted for 2 years but later its life was extended in 1987 via the TADA-1987. The act was repealed in 1995 due to its misuse.\r\nUnder TADA 1985, two new offences were created namely ‘terror act’ and ‘disruptive activities’ were included. The law had placed restriction on granting bails and gave enhanced power for detention of suspects and attaching the properties of the accused. The law made confession before a police officer admissible. Exclusive courts were set up to hear the cases under the act."
