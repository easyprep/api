  "question": "In a recent study by an autonomous institute of DST, the organ of which water species has been used to develop a catalyst in energy conversion devices?",
  "option1": "Crab",
  "option2": "Fish",
  "option3": "Turtle",
  "option4": "Prawn",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Fish",
  "explanation": "The Scientists at the Institute of Nano Science and Technology (INST), Mohali, an autonomous institute under the Department of Science and Technology, have recently discovered that fish gills can be used to develop efficient electro-catalyst used in building energy conversion devices.\r\nThe devices thus developed are claimed to be more affordable and environment friendly. It is also expected to work better than the commercial Platinum on carbon (Pt/C) catalyst. The study has been published in the American Chemical Society’s ‘Inorganic Chemistry’ journal."
