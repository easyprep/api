  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nIndia and Russia signed MoI to open a maritime route between the ports of Chennai and Vladivostok. This route bypasses Europe. Through this route, the cargo between Vladivostok and Chennai can be transferred in 24 days. Currently, it takes more than 40 days to transfer the cargo between Vladivostok and Chennai.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nTrans-Siberian Highway is the unofficial name given to a network of federal highways that stretches across Russia from Baltic sea and the Sea of Japan. It is almost 7000 miles. It is one of the longest highways in the world. In the Asian Highway network, it is termed as AH6, there is a dispute between Australia Highway 1 and Trans-Siberian Highway for the title of the longest national highway in the world."
