  "explanation": "The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had increased the minimum investment limit by clients in a Portfolio Management Service (PMS) to Rs 50 lakh, from the earlier limit of Rs 25 lakh. The base net worth requirement of portfolio managers was raised to Rs 5 crore from the earlier Rs 2 crore. SEBI also directed that more than 25 per cent of the Portfolio Manager’s assets under management cannot be invested in unlisted securities. \r\nThe Government has recently released a gazette notification, with these directions of SEBI, which were released in November 2019. The existing Portfolio Managers are given three years’ time to meet the revised norms."
