  "option4": "They are first to reach the surface",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "They are transverse waves",
  "explanation": "Primary waves ( P - Waves) are the first to reach the surface.Â <br />They are similar to sound waves and hence they are longitudinal waves - in which particle movement is in the same direction of wave propagation.<br />Secondary waves are transverse waves."
