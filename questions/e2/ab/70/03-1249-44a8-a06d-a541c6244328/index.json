  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nMephedrone is also known as M-CAT and has been emerging as the latest drug for abuse, especially in cities like Mumbai. The drug is listed under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. This implies that the drug’s use, manufacture, sale etc. is prohibited in India.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nMephedrone is used by drug addicts as a cheaper alternative to cocaine. This is because, it is produced in the country itself while most of the cocaine is smuggled. The drug’s abuse is rampant among students and models because of its ability to keep the user awake for about 12 hours and also induce weight loss."
