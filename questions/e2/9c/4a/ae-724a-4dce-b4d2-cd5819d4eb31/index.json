  "answer": "Surendranath Banerji",
  "explanation": "Surendranath Banerji cleared the competitive examination in 1869, but was barred owing to a dispute over his exact age. After clearing the matter in the courts, Banerjee cleared the exam again in 1871 and was posted as assistant magistrate in Sylhet. However, Banerjee was dismissed soon from his job owing to racial discrimination. Satyendranath Tagore in 1863 became the first Indian to qualify the ICS."
