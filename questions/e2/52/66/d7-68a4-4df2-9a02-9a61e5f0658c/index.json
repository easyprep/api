  "option2": "Bhutan",
  "option3": "Myanmar",
  "option4": "Bangladesh",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Bangladesh",
  "explanation": "For the first time, the Border Security Force (BSF) and the Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) have declared an 8.3 km stretch along the Indo-Bangladesh border a 'crime free zone' on March 10, 2018 to curb criminal activities including smuggling. It is the first-ever crime-free zone declared by both the countries. The stretch falls between the border outpost of Gunarmath and Kalyani of the BSF and Putkhali and Daulatpur of the BGB. This stretch is one of the most vulnerable with cattle smuggling and other criminal activities prevalent. With the help of civil administrations of the two countries, NGOs and the local populace, both border-guarding forces will help ensure no crime takes place along the stretch. This is a pilot project that will be reviewed after 5-6 months.",
