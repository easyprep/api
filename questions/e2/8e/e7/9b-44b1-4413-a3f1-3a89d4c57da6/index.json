The Baku–Tbilisi–Kars (BTK), or Baku–Tbilisi–Akhalkalaki–Kars railway (BTAK), became operational on 30 October 2017. This is a regional rail link project to directly connect Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. The Baku–Tbilisi–Kars project is intended to complete a transport corridor linking Azerbaijan to Turkey (and therefore Central Asia and China to Europe) by rail. The line is intended to transport an initial annual volume of 6.5 million tonnes, rising to a long-term target of 17 million tonnes."
