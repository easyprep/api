  "question": "The price of an article is raised by 30% and then two successive discounts of 10% each are allowed. Ultimately the price of the article is :",
  "option1": "decreased by 3%",
  "option2": "decreased by 5.3%",
  "option3": "increased by 10%",
  "option4": "increased by 5.3%",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "increased by 5.3%",
  "explanation": "Let the original price be 100 Rs.\r\n∴ Increased Price = 130 Rs.\r\nEquivalent discount =\r\n$latex  =  \\\\left ( 10+10-\\\\frac{10\\\\times 10}{100} \\\\right ) = 19\\\\%&s=1$\r\n∴ Ultimate price of the article = 81% of 130 = 105.3 so the price of the article is increased by 5.3%. \r\nHence option [D] is correct answer."
