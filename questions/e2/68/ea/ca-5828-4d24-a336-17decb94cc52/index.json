  "question": "Pluto is considered to be a dwarf planet and not a planet. What could be the possible explanation to this?",
  "option1": "It is not in an orbit around the Sun",
  "option2": "It is not massive enough to be sphere by its own gravitation",
  "option3": "It makes a two system body with Neptune",
  "option4": "It has not cleared its neighbouring region of small bodies",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "It has not cleared its neighbouring region of small bodies",
  "explanation": "According to current definitions, objects in orbit around the Sun are classed dynamically and physically into three categories: planets, dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. A planet is any body in orbit around the Sun that has enough mass to form itself into a spherical shape and has cleared its immediate neighborhood of all smaller objects. By this definition, the Solar System has eight known planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Pluto does not fit this definition, as it has not cleared its orbit of surrounding Kuiper belt objects. A dwarf planet is a celestial body orbiting the Sun that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity but has not cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals and is not a satellite. By this definition, the Solar System has five known dwarf planets: Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris.Other objects may be classified in the future as dwarf planets, such as Sedna, Orcus, and Quaoar. Dwarf planets that orbit in the trans-Neptunian region are called &#8220;plutoids&#8221;.The remainder of the objects in orbit around the Sun are small Solar System bodies."
