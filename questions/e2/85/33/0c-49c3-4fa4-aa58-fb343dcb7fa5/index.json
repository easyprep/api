  "option3": 30,
  "option4": 35,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 20,
  "explanation": "Numbers of students in section A = x\r\n∴ Numbers of students in section B and C = (100 - x)\r\n∴ x $latex \\\\times$ 70 + (100 - x) $latex \\\\times$ 87.5 = 84 $latex \\\\times$ 100\r\n=> 70x + 87.5 $latex \\\\times$ 100 - 87.5x = 8400\r\n=> 8750 - 17.5x = 8400\r\n=> 17.5x = 8750 - 8400\r\n$latex => x = \\\\frac{350}{17.5} = 20&s=1$\r\nHence option [A] is correct answer."
