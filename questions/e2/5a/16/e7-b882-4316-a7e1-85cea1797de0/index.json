  "question": "Consider the following statements:<br />1. The axis of the earth magnetic field is inclined at 23 to the geographic axis of the earth.<br />2. The earth’s magnetic pole in the northern hemisphere is located on a peninsula in northern Canada.<br />3. Earth’s magnetic equator passes through Thumna in South India.<br />Which of the statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1, 2 and 3",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "2 only",
  "option4": "3 only",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 and 3",
  "explanation": "The axis of earth is inclined to the plane of the ecliptic at an angle of 66 ½ degree, giving rise to different seasons and varying lengths of day and night. Earth rotates on its own axis, tilted at an angle of 23.4 degrees every 23 hour 56 minutes giving rise to Day and Night.<br />The North Magnetic Pole moves over time due to magnetic changes in Earth\\'s core. In 2001, it was determined by the Geological Survey of Canada to lie west of Ellesmere Island in northern Canada at 81.3°N 110.8°W. It was situated at 83.1°N 117.8°W in 2005.<br />The Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) is an Indian spaceport operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation. It is located in Thumba, Thiruvananthapuram which is near the southern tip of mainland India, very close to earth\\'s magnetic equator."
