  "option4": 1857,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 1876,
  "explanation": "The first woollen textiles mill was set up in 1876 at Kanpur, because Kanpur was the principal depot for the British Indian Army. The industry did not flourish because of a short winter and long summer in India leading to inadequate demand. Also, the textiles produced were of poor quality. After independence, there was rapid development of the industry mainly as an export-oriented industry."
