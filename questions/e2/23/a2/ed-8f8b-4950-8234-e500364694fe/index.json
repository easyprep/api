  "explanation": "Suez Canal is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt. It links the Mediterranean with the Red Sea through Isthmus of Suez. It was first opened in 1869 after a decade of construction. Strategically and economically it is one of the most important waterways in the world providing the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. Its opening had provided alternative route to sea voyage between Europe and India. It had reduced the sea voyage distance between these two regions by about 7,000 kilometers without navigating around Africa"
