  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThough vaccines against plague is available, the World Health Organisation does not recommend universal vaccination. It recommends vaccination only for high-risk groups for prevention purposes. It recommends strengthening of surveillance in countries which had experienced a plague outbreak in the past.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nOceania is not susceptible to plague according to WHO. All other continents are susceptible to the disease, especially Asia, Middle East and Europe. The last outbreak of plague was in 2017 in Madagascar. India too had experienced a plague outbreak in the past."
