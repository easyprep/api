He was born in Karachi into a musical aristocracy steeped in the traditions of Indian classical music. Despite his dedication to conserving the heritage of classical vocal music, Pandit Narayanrao devoted a considerable amount of his career to Marathi natya sangeet (enactment of musicals on stage). Though he acted in some films and worked in the television medium, Pandit Narayanrao remained devoted to the uncompromising art of Hindustani classical music â€” and promoting it in its purest form."
