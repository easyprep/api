  "question": "With reference to the recent discussion about ‘presolar grains’, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Presolar grains are formed from the sun.</li>\n<li>All presolar grains are stardust.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe presolar grains were derived from stars that predated the sun and the solar system. The isotopic composition of these grains are dependent on the parent star’s stellar nucleosynthesis process (nuclear fusion process that creates the elements). This is different from that of the sun and the galactic average itself.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe term presolar grain is used to refer to any interstellar solid matter that formed before the formation of the sun. Stardust is the grains derived from a single star. The presolar grains studied by scientists are found trapped in meteorites. These contain stardust and interstellar cloud matter."
