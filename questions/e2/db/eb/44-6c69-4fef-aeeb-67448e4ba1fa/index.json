It cuts through the Himalayas in Nepal and joins the Sarda River at Brahmaghat in India. Indus River, originating in the Tibetan plateau of western China in the vicinity of Lake Mansarovar in Tibet Autonomous Region, the river runs a course through the Ladakh district of Jammu and Kashmir and then enters Pakistan via the Northern Areas {Gilgit-Baltistan}, flowing through the North in a southerly direction along the entire length of Pakistan, to merge into the Arabian Sea near the port city of Karachi in Sindh. Sutlej River, the longest of the five rivers that flow through the historic crossroad region of Punjab in northern India and Pakistan, originates near Lake Rakshastal in Tibet near Mount Kailas, and it flows generally west and southwest entering India through the Shipki La pass in Himachal Pradesh."
