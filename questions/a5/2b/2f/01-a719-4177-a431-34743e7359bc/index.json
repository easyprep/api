  "option2": "Uranus",
  "option3": "Mars",
  "option4": "Earth",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Uranus",
  "explanation": "Uranus is the only planet whose equator is nearly at a right angle to its orbit, with a tilt of 97.77 degrees, which is possibly the result of a collision with an Earth-sized object long ago. This unique tilt causes the most extreme seasons in the solar system."
