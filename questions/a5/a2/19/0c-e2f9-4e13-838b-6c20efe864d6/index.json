  "answer": "Movement of a part of earth’s surface on account of the faulting of rocks",
  "explanation": "Earthquakes are usually caused when rock underground suddenly breaks along a fault. This sudden release of energy causes the seismic waves that make the ground shake. When two blocks of rock or two plates are rubbing against each other, they stick a little.  When the rocks break, the earthquake occurs."
