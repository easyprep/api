  "question": "Christina Koch, who will set a new record for longest spaceflight by a woman, is the astronaut of which space agency?",
  "option1": "JAXA",
  "option2": "Roscosmos",
  "option3": "NASA",
  "option4": "CNES",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "NASA",
  "explanation": "NASA astronaut Christina Koch will set record for longest single spaceflight by a woman. Her mission on the International Space Station (ISS) has extended to 328 days. Koch arrived at the space station on 14th March 2019, and now is scheduled to remain in orbit until February 2020. With this, she will eclipse the record of 288 days set by former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson in 2016-17. As part of the schedule changes two new astronauts, Andrew Morgan and Jessica Meir, will join Koch on the ISS later this year, their first space flights ever. Morgan will also stay at the ISS longer than originally planned, getting there in July and remaining there until mid-2020. By extending the space flights of Koch and Andrew Morgan, NASA will be able to gather more data on the changes to human cognitive and bodily functions to support its future missions to the Moon and Mars."
