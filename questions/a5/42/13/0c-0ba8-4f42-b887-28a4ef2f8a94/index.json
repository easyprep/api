  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Red snow&#8217; is caused by an alga called Chlamydomonas nivalis. Red tide is a common name for a phenomenon known as an algal bloom (large concentrations of aquatic microorganisms) when it is caused by a few species of dinoflagellates and the bloom takes on a red or brown color. Another alga Cepheleuros virescence parasitizes tea plants and produces the disease &#8220;red rust.&#8221; One more option Red Sea could also be added to this question. That part of the Mediterranian sea in which the blue-green alga Trichodesmium grows profusely is called the &#8216;Red sea&#8217;, It is due to the presence of red phycoerythrin in the cells of Trichodesmium."
