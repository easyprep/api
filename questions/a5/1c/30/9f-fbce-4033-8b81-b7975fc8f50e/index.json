  "question": "With reference to World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, which of the following statements are correct?\n<ol>\n<li>Out of the 17 countries listed as facing “extremely high” water stress, India ranks 13th.</li>\n<li>The report say that even small dry shocks will produce dire consequences here.</li>\n<li>India is yet to face its first incident of ‘Day Zero’.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 and 2",
  "option2": "1 and 3",
  "option3": "2 and 3",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 2",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nThe Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas created by the World Resources Institute maps water crisis across 189 countries and also sub-national regions (states/ provinces). It studied water stress, drought risk and riverine flooding risks for ranking the countries. Of the 17 identified countries in the “extremely high” water stressed category, India ranks 13<sup>th</sup>. \n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe study says that with ongoing climate change phenomenon, dry shocks will become more frequent. Due to unsustainable balance of the demand and supply, even small shocks will have drastic effect on the populations. Middle East and North Africa are represented by 12 out of the 17 most vulnerable countries list. The report also says that the water scarcity will exacerbate conflicts. \n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nDay zero is declared when the city has almost no water left. Day zero was declared on 19<sup>th</sup> June 2019 in Chennai. The city has 4 main reservoirs, all of which went dry due to poor rains and water table recharge. It is expected that other cities like Bangalore are also prone to such a scenario in the coming years if measures are not taken. \n&nbsp;"
