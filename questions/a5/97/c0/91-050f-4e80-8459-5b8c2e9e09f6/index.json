  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "First two statements are correct and notable points. Third statement is not correct. A funnel cloud is generally the cause of a twister or tornado. It is funnel-shaped cloud of condensed water droplets, associated with a rotating column of wind and extending from the base of a cloud (usually a cumulonimbus or towering cumulus cloud) but not reaching the ground or a water surface. A funnel cloud is usually visible as a cone-shaped or needle like protuberance from the main cloud base. Funnel clouds form most frequently in association with supercell thunderstorms. If a funnel cloud touches the ground it becomes a tornado. Most tornadoes begin as funnel clouds, but many funnel clouds do not make ground contact and so do not become tornadoes. (Wikipedia)"
