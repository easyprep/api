  "option3": "Stress is equal to strain",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Stress is directly proportional to strain",
  "explanation": "According to this law, within the elastic limit, stress is directly proportional to the strain. Therefore, Stress/Strain = constant and is known as modulus of elasticity."
