  "question": "The speed of a stream is 3 km/hr and the speed of a man in still water is 5 km/hr. The time taken by the man to swim 26 km downstream is :",
  "option1": "$latex 13 hrs$",
  "option2": "$latex 5\\frac{1}{5}hrs&s=1$",
  "option3": "$latex 3\\frac{1}{4}hrs&s=1$",
  "option4": "$latex 8\\frac{2}{3}hrs&s=1$",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "$latex 3\\frac{1}{4}hrs&s=1$",
  "explanation": "$latex \\\\mathbf{3\\\\frac{1}{4}hrs}&s=1$</b><br />\r\n$latex Time = \\\\frac{Distance}{Rate Downstream}&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{26}{5+3} = \\\\frac{13}{4} = 3\\\\frac{1}{4} hours&s=1$\r\nHence option [C] is correct answer."
