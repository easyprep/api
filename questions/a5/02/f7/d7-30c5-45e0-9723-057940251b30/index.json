  "question": "As per the recent report of the National Centre of Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR), which ocean has seen the greatest decline of ice in the last 41 years?",
  "option1": "Arctic Ocean",
  "option2": "Antarctic Ocean",
  "option3": "Pacific Ocean",
  "option4": "Indian Ocean",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Arctic Ocean",
  "explanation": "The National Centre of Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR) has found that the Arctic Ocean has seen the largest decline in the last 41 years due to global warming.\r\nThis has led to localised increase in evaporation, air humidity, cloud cover and rainfall. NCPOR noted that this decline in Arctic Sea ice was -13 per cent in July 2019 while it was -4.7 per cent per decade in the last 40 years. The study also noted that if this trend continues, there would be no ice left in the Arctic sea by 2050."
