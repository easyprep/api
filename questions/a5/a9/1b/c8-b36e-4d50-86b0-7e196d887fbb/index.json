Solstice happens twice a year, and twice a year happen the equinoxes. Altogether, the four are considered to start 4 seasons.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>At the time of northern solstice, sun is perceived to be directly overhead the 23.44° north known as Tropic of Cancer.</li>\r\n<li>Likewise, at the southern solstice the same thing happens for latitude 23.44° south, known as the Tropic of Capricorn.</li>\r\n</ul>"
