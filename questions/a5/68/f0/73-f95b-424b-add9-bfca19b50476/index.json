  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "Extensive development of dairy farming in the dairy belt of North America has been possible due to the presence of a combination of physical and economic factors. The region receives a rainfall varying between 55 and 125 cm. The rainfall efficiency is further increased by relatively lower temperature ranging between 18° and 24°C. The cattle yield more milk in a cool climate and the milk can also be kept for a longer time at lower temperature."
