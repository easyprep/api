In the Diwani Adalat, the Collector was to preside assisted by this 'native dewan'. The Faujdari Adalat was to be presided over by the Qazi or Mufti of the district and two maulavis subject to the supervision of the Collector. In addition to these, two superior courts were established at Calcutta â€“ Sadar Diwani Adalat, as a Court of Appeal in civil cases and Sadar Nizamat Adalat to hear criminal appeals."
