  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The Constitution of India incorporated the idea of fundamental rights from various declarations and several Constitutions of leading liberal democracies of the world. On one hand, there is the French Declaration of Rights of Man as a Citizen, the Bill of Rights of the U.S. institution, the Irish Constitution of 1935, the post-war Constitutions of Japan and Burma, (now Myanmar), and on the other hand there is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which have influenced the framers of the Indian Constitution to prepare a list of basic rights for the people of India to ensure fullest development of their personalities. Regarding Irish Constitution, kindly note that it helped the two viz. Fundamental Rights and DPSP as distinct entities by making former enforceable and later non-enforceable via courts."
