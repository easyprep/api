  "answer": "Su Tseng-chang",
  "explanation": "Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen has appointed Su Tseng-chang as the island\\'s new Prime Minister, during a Cabinet reshuffle following the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)\\'s heavy losses in local elections. Su’s appointment follows the widely-expected resignation of William Lai, the second premier to quit since Tsai took office in 2016, in line with a practice of leaders quitting when their party loses a major election. Su is a former premier appointed in 2006 by then-President Chen Shui-bian and was a chairman of Tsai’s DPP for two terms."
