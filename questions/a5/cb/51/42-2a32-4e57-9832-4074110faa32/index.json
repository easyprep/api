  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Sericulture refers to the rearing of silk worms and obtaining silk from them. Silk is obtained from the cocoon that is made by the silk worm in one of the stages of its life cycle. For obtaining silk, the worm has to be killed in the cocoon. It is done by putting cocoons in boiling water. If this is not done in time, the worm grows into a moth and comes out of the cocoon by cutting it and the silk yarn of the cocoon is thus destroyed. The process of obtaining silk from the cocoons is also labour intensive. It is one of the major reasons for a high cost of silk."
