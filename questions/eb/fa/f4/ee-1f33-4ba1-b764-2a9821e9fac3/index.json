  "question": "Bacillus thuringiensis:<br> 1. Is widely used as an insecticide<br> 2. Is source of gene responsible for producing Bt toxin in some Genetically modified plants<br> 3. Is an indicator of water pollution<br> Which among the above is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 2",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Bacillus thuringiensis (or Bt) is a Gram-positive, soil-dwelling bacterium, commonly used as a biological pesticide. B. thuringiensis also occurs naturally in the <em><u>gut of caterpillars</u></em> of various types of moths and butterflies, as well on leaf surfaces, aquatic environments, animal feces, insect rich environments, flour mills and grain storage facilities. During sporulation, many Bt strains produce crystal proteins (proteinaceous inclusions), called ?-endotoxins, that have Insecticide action. This has led to their use as insecticides, and more recently to genetically modified crops using Bt genes. Many crystal-producing Bt strains, though, do not have insecticidal properties."
