On this day in 1946, freedom fighter Dr Ram Manohar Lohia gave a clarion call to the people of the state to unite and fight against the Portuguese colonial regime. The revolutionary call provided a spark to Goa’s freedom struggle and the state was finally liberated on 19th December 1961. Goa was ruled by the Portuguese for 451 years, before the State was liberated by the Indian armed forces in 1961."
