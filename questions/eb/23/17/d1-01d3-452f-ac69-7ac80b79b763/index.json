  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nAnaemia is a characterised by insufficient blood cells or insufficient oxygen carrying capacity of the blood cell. There are many nutritional and non-nutritional causes of anaemia. Iron deficiency is a major cause. Apart from this, copper deficiency can also lead to anaemia as insufficient copper affects the bodyâ€™s ability to incorporate iron into the system.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Anaemia Mukt Bharat program seeks to reduce the prevalence of anaemia by 3% every year between 2018 and 2022. Identifying and tackling non-nutritional causes of anaemia is one of the 6 strategic interventions adopted by the program. It will create awareness about the effect of malaria and hemoglobinopathies.\n&nbsp;"
