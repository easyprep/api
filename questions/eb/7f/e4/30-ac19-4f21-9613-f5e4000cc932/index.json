  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Biogas plants",
  "explanation": "“Shakti Surabhi Model” is related to Bio-Methanation plant. It provides 3-in-1 solution viz. Fuel supply to the kitchen; Safe disposal of organic waste; Liquid manure by way of Slurry from the plant. It has been developed by Vivekananda Kendra – Natural Resources Development Project (nardep) for producing biogas from kitchen and vegetable waste. The plant is a result of research of almost a quarter century as well as field work put forth by the engineers and extension workers of VK-nardep. It is an improvement over the general floating drum type biogas plant. Fixed model Shakthi Surabhi plants are suitable and economical for rural areas. It is not only individual households who are benefitted from it but also larger institutions with hostels and community kitchen halls. Deenbandhu fixed model is also a biogas plant model. This type of plant is mainly located in the Himalayan region. The main feature of a Deenbandhu biogas plant is the fixed underground digester chamber, constructed with a layer of bricks and an additional layer of cement mortar forming the roof above. In colder climates like the lower regions of the Himalaya, the Deenbandhu fixed model is ideal because the digestion chamber is underground providing good insulation against the cold."
