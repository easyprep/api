The Supreme court has also asked all the high courts to send the copy of the verdict to all the trial courts to avoid people being prosecuted under the scrapped provision.The court disposed off the application filed by an NGO alleging that people were still being prosecuted under the provision. The section 66A of IT Act provided for jail term to people who post offensive content online and it was scrapped by the apex court in March 2015."
