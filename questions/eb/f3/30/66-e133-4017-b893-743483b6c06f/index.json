  "question": "With reference to recently discovered Prometheoarchaeum, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It was discovered in the Pacific Ocean.</li>\n<li>It is an example of eukaryotic organism.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Prometheoarchaeum is a new species of archaea that was recently discovered at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Its discovery is significant in understanding the evolution of complex life forms from simple single celled organisms. The organism fed on protein fragments to thrive at the bottom of the ocean- a very nutrient deficient environment.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:   </strong>\nThe Prometheoarchaeum is an example for prokaryotes, like all other archaea members. They are microscopic organisms without membrane bound organelles. The microbe begins as a small sphere and then grows tentacles and membrane bound bubbles. The insides are composed of proteins and DNA."
