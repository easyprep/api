  "option1": 0.067,
  "option2": 0.072,
  "option3": 0.07,
  "option4": 0.074,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 0.07,
  "explanation": "The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has expected Indiaâ€™s economy to grow 7.0% in calendar year 2018 compared with 6.2% in 2017. As per the report \\\"Trade and Development\\\",   the effects of demonetization are still evident in private consumption trends within the economy. It also emphasised that countries like India and Thailand, which have been most favoured by foreign investors and experienced the largest spike in asset prices, would be most vulnerable to capital outflows. Further, countries like India which are dealing with Current Account Deficits (CAD) have a tendency of reducing imports.  This assumes significance in the wake of India putting in place measures to control the rising CAD and capital outflows."
