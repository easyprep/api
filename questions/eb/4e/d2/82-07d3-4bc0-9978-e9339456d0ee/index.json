  "answer": "Second",
  "explanation": "As per information shared by Indian Cellular Association (ICA) with Telecom Minister Manoj Sinha and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, India is now the second largest mobile phone producer in the world after China. CA's claim was based on data available from market research firm IHS, China's National Bureau of Statistics and Vietnam General Statistics Office. With 11 million units produced in 2017, India replaced Vietnam as the second largest producer of mobile phones in 2017. On account of rise in domestic production, imports of the devices in India also reduced to less than half in 2017-18. Fast Track Task Force (FTTF), a body under Union Ministry of Electronics and IT, has set target to achieve around 500 million mobile phone production in India by 2019.",
