  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "<strong>Appointment of CAG is done by President while taking views of not only prime minister but also Leader of opposition</strong> <br />This is incorrect statement. The president appoints on recommendation by Prime Minister. <br /><strong>Removal of CAG is very difficult and needs concurrence of President, Chief Justice of Supreme Court as well as Prime Minister <br /></strong> This is incorrect statement. Removal of CAG is difficult because follows same procedure as that of removal of a judge of Supreme Court. <br /><strong>Salary and expenses of CAG are charged expenditures<br /></strong> This is correct statement. Charged expenditures are not voted by legislature."
