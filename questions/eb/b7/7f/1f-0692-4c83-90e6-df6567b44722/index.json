  "question": "Which of the following countries has become the worldâ€™s first nation to recognise 'orphanage trafficking' as a form of modern slavery?",
  "option1": "Indonesia",
  "option2": "Spain",
  "option3": "Belgium",
  "option4": "Australia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Australia",
  "explanation": "Australia has become the first country in the world to recognise so-called orphanage trafficking as a form of modern-day slavery. Hence, it has criminalized the act of falsely inducing children into orphanages as a form of slavery, in what is believed to be the first move of its kind in the world. Under the new law, orphanage trafficking will be treated as a slavery and trafficking offense. The legislation forms part of a wider drive to stop Australians taking part in \\\"voluntourism\\\" schemes which harm rather than help the children. It is estimated 80% of children in orphanages around the world have at least one living parent but are in orphanages in a bid to attract international volunteers. This is what\\'s called \\\"Orphanage trafficking\\\" where children are actively recruited into orphanages for the purpose of exploitation and profit made from orphanage tourism, where people pay or donate to volunteer and visit orphanages."
