  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Irish harp is a stringed instrument. The harp has been played for over 1,000 years in Ireland and hence was included in the list. The strings are made of metal and the body is of wood. The strings are played using the fingernails.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nIrish harping is the first listing from Ireland. Previously, the uilleann piping and hurling practices had been listed by UNESCO. The Uilleann pipes are bagpipes- a kind of musical instrument. Hurling is a team sport involving sticks called hurl and a small ball."
