That is why it is called the \\'Statue Of Unity\\'. It is the world\\'s tallest statue, with a height of 182m.  It  located around 3.5 km downstream from the Sardar Sarovar Dam, on islet Sadhu Bet on the bed of the river Narmada. The statue  was designed by 93-year-old acclaimed sculptor Ram V. Sutar, who is Padma Bhushan awardee.  It is built by Larsen & Toubro Ltd at a cost of Rs. 2,989 crore.  The Statue of Unity is made up of 70,000 tonnes of cement, 18,500 tonnes of reinforcement steel, 6,000 tonnes of structural steel and 1,700 metric tonnes of bronze, which was used for the outer cladding of the structure. The viewing gallery at the height of 135 metres can accommodate up to 200 people at a time."
