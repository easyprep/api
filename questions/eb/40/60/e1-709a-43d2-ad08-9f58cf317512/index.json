  "question": "What is the main reason for the average temperature of the Earth remains fairly steady as compared to that of the moon?</span>",
  "option1": "Hydrosphere",
  "option2": "Biosphere",
  "option3": "Lithosphere",
  "option4": "Atmosphere",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Atmosphere",
  "explanation": "The average temperature of the earth remains fairly steady as compared to that of the moon mainly because of the earth’s atmosphere. The atmosphere of earth is capable of absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, which causes warming of the surface through heat retention (greenhouse effect) and reducing temperature extremes between day and night. The atmospheric layer is not present in the Moon.</span>"
