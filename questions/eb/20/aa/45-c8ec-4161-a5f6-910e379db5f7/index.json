  "option1": "Reconciliation between the English and Portuguese",
  "option2": "A secret offer of naval help to the Mughal emperor to oust the Portuguese",
  "option3": "A heavy dose of bribe to Nur Jahan",
  "option4": "The defeat of Portuguese naval squadrons by the English",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "The defeat of Portuguese naval squadrons by the English",
  "explanation": "On March 12, 1612, Jahangir granted a firman permitting the British establishing factories at Surat, Gogha, Ahmedabad and Cambay. Thus, Surat became the first established settlement of British in India and a factory was established there in 1612-13. The newly formed company had sent four ships under Captain Thomas Best to trade with India. These were mercantile ships but were capable of defending themselves. They defeated the Portuguese, who were already there in Surat for at least 100 years. This defeat apparently so impressed the Emperor Jahangir that he granted the British squadron a firman to trade."
