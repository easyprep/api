  "question": "Arrange the following gases in the increasing order of Global warming potential:<br />1) Methane<br />2) Nitrous oxide<br />3) Perfluoro carbons<br />4) Sulfur hexafluoride<br />Select the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1, 2, 3, 4",
  "option2": "2, 1, 3, 4",
  "option3": "1, 2, 4, 3",
  "option4": "2, 1, 4, 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3, 4",
  "explanation": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) has a GWP of 1 and serves as a baseline for other GWP values. GWP of Methane is 21. GWP of Nitrous oxide is 310, GWP of Perfluorocarbons is 140-11,700, and GWP of Sulfur hexafluoride is 23,900. Hence the correct sequence is 1, 2, 3, 4."
