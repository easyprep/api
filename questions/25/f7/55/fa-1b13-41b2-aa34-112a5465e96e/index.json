  "answer": "A Georgian Poet",
  "explanation": "Prince Nikoloz \"Tato\" Baratashvili (4 December 1817 â€“ 21 October 1845) was a Georgian poet. He was one of the first Georgians to marry modern nationalism with European Romanticism and to introduce \"Europeanism\" into Georgian literature. Due to his early death, Baratashvili left a relatively small literary heritage of fewer than forty short lyrics, one extended poem, and a few private letters, but he is nevertheless considered to be the high point of Georgian Romanticism. He was referred to as the \"Georgian Byron\"."
