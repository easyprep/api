  "option1": "Trade winds",
  "option2": "Cyclones",
  "option3": "Westerlies",
  "option4": "Polar winds",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Westerlies",
  "explanation": "The prevailing westerlies are one of the five primary wind zones, known as wind belts, that comprise our atmosphere&#8217;s circulatory system. They reach from where the horse latitudes leave off to approximately 60 degrees north and south latitude. The prevailing westerlies tend to be very unpredictable, but they are known to originate in the west more often than not. Wind speeds can be great in areas with few landmasses to interfere with the westerlies, especially around 40 to 50 degrees south latitude, which is nicknamed &#8220;the roaring 40s. Westerlies, anti-trades,or Prevailing Westerlies, are prevailing winds in the middle latitudes between 30 and 60 degrees latitude, blowing from the high pressure area in the horse latitudes towards the poles."
