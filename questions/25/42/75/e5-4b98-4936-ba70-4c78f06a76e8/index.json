  "option4": "Seven-meter throw",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Free throw",
  "explanation": "A free-throw restarts the play after an interruption by the referees. It takes places from the spot where the interruption was caused, as long as this spot is outside of the free-throw line of the opposing team.
