  "question": "Physico-chemical characteristics of water in water sources undergo changes due to which of the following processes?",
  "option1": "Aquatic macrophytes",
  "option2": "aquatic fungi",
  "option3": "effluents",
  "option4": "evapotranspiration",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "effluents",
  "explanation": "Aquatic macrophytes, aquatic fungi are natural organism and evapotranspiration is a natural process by which plant losses water. Thus being natural they do not results into any change in physico-chemical characteristics of water while effluents discharged into water bodies by industrial units and domestic sewage results in to change in physico-chemical characteristics like pH, conductivity, temperature, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical  oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, NH4+ and  NO3- ion contents etc."
