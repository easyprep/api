Second statement is correct. There have already been three instances so far, when the Motion of Thanks was adopted by Rajya Sabha with 7 8 amendments. The Motion of Thanks with an amendment was adopted for the first time on 30 January 1980. On 29 December 1989, the Motion of Thanks was adopted with six amendments. Again on 12 March 2001, the Motion of Thanks was adopted with an amendment. This was the fourth one."
