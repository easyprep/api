The proposed dam will be providing water to Haldwani and Nainital districts of Uttarakhand and will also meet the water needs of Bijnor and Rampur districts in Uttar Pradesh. <em>Shahpur Kandi Dam</em> is under construction project between Jammu &amp; Kashmir and Punjab. The estimated cost of the project is Rs. 2285.81 crore. It is a 55.5-metre high dam located in Gurdaspur district of Punjab. <em>Mandal dam is a part of the North Koel Reservoir Project</em>, an interstate project between Jharkhand and Bihar on river Koel, a tributary of Son River. Its construction was originally started in the year 1972 and continued till 1993 when it was stopped by the Forest Department, Govt. of Bihar. Since then, the work on dam is at a standstill. However, recently the Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi gave approval for the completion of the project."
