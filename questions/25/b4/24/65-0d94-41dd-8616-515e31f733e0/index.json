  "question": "What is the change in the angular momentum of a system as per the Law of Conservation of Angular momentum, if the total external torque acting is zero?",
  "option1": "Remains constant",
  "option2": "Becomes zero",
  "option3": "Increases exponentially",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Remains constant",
  "explanation": "Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum: if the total external torque acting on a system is zero, the angular momentum of a system remains constant. Angular Momentum is the momentum associated with the rotation of an object. Angular Momentum = moment of Inertia X angular Speed"
