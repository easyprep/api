  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3 Only",
  "explanation": "Zero Shadow Day (ZSD) is a biannual phenomenon when the sun is exactly overhead and a personâ€™s shadow disappears for a few minutes. In 2018, Zero Shadow Day (ZSD) was observed in various cities between May 6 and 20. Zero Shadow Day is observed at places located between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn because there comes a time when on a particular day, the sun is exactly overhead and one\\'s shadow disappears for a few minutes. Chennai, Mumbai and Pune fall between Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn and so are likely to observe Zero Shadow Day whereas, New Delhi does not fall b/w Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn and so will not observe Zero Shadow Day."
