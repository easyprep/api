  "answer": "Georgia",
  "explanation": "The Kodori Valley, also known as the Kodori Gorge, is a river valley in Abkhazia, Georgia's breakaway autonomous republic. The valley's upper part, populated by Svans, was the only corner of the post-1993 Abkhazia, directly controlled by the central Georgian government, which since 2006 officially styles the area as Upper Abkhazia. On August 12, 2008, Russoâ€“Abkhazian forces gained control of the Upper Kodori Valley, previously controlled by Georgia. It is internationally recognised as part of the country of Georgia and partially recognised as part of the state of Abkhazia."
