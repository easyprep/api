  "question": "LCM of two numbers is 2079 and their HCF is 27. If one of the number is 189, the other number is :",
  "option1": 189,
  "option2": 216,
  "option3": 297,
  "option4": 584,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 297,
  "explanation": "$latex \\\\because Second\\\\ Number = \\\\frac{HCF\\\\times LCM}{First\\\\ Number}&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{27\\\\times 2079}{189} = 297&s=1$\r\nHence option [C] is correct answer."
