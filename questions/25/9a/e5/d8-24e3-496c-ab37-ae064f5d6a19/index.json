It was initially given the mandate to recommend candidates for the top post in state-run banks and financial institutions, but later, its role was expanded to help banks in developing strategies and capital raising plans. Recently, the government proposed to revamp the Banks Board Bureau (BBB) and select a successor for the incumbent chairman Vinod Rai. The Banks Board Bureau has three ex-officio members and three expert members in addition to Chairman. Except for ex-officio members, all the Members and Chairman are part-time."
