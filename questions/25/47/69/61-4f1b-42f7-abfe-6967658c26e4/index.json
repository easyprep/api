  "explanation": "The Stratosphere is the layer of the Earth's atmosphere which lies beyond the troposphere. It extends up to an altitude of 50 kilometres from the earth's surface. This layer is almost free from clouds and associated weather phenomenon. It therefore makes conditions most ideal for flying aeroplanes. The temperature rises at a rate of 5Â°C per kilometer through this layer."
