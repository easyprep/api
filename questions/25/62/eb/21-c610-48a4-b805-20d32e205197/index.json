  "answer": "Act to change laws that Discriminate",
  "explanation": "The Zero Discrimination Day (ZDD) is observed every year  on 1st of March to promote equality before the law and in practice throughout all of the member countries of the UN. The days aims to tell people that nobody should be differentiated based on their HIV status, age, sex, gender identity, race, ethnicity, language, geographical location or migrant status. The 2019 campaign \\'Act to change laws that Discriminate\\' challenges people to act against laws that discriminate in their country. The campaign encourages people to ask themselves \\\"What if â€¦\\\" and to think about their own actions. For example: \\'What if your neighbour had tuberculosis? Would you stop to chat?\\'"
