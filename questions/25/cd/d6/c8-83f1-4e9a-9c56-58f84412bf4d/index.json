The first estimate will be made in 2019 and subsequently every year until 2022. This index will appraise the condition of the underlying digital infrastructure and related factors at state/UT levels. It will provide useful insights into strategic choices made by states for investment allocations in ICT programmes. The index will encourage states to cross learn and jointly participate in achieving the overall objective of digital inclusion and development in India."
