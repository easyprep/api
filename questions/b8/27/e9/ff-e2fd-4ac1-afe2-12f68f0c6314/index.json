  "question": "A journey takes 4 hours 30 minutes at a speed of 60 km/hr. If the speed is 15 m/s, then the journey will take :",
  "option1": "5 hours",
  "option2": "5 hours 30 minutes",
  "option3": "6 hours",
  "option4": "6 hours 25 minutes",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "5 hours",
  "explanation": "$latex 60\\\\ km/hr = 60\\\\times \\\\frac{5}{18}\\\\ m/s = \\\\frac{50}{3}\\\\ m/s&s=1$\r\n$latex \\\\therefore\\\\ Speed \\\\propto \\\\frac{1}{Time}&s=1$\r\n$latex => S_{1}\\\\times T_{1} = S_{2}\\\\times T_{2}$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{50}{3}\\\\times \\\\frac{9}{2} = 15\\\\times T_{2}&s=1$\r\n$latex => 75 = 15\\\\times T_{2}$\r\n$latex => T_{2} = \\\\frac{75}{15} = 5\\\\ hours&s=1$\r\nHence option [A] is correct answer."
