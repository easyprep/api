  "option1": "Denmark",
  "option2": "Belgium",
  "option3": "France",
  "option4": "Netherlands",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "France",
  "explanation": "The \"Place Stanislas, Place de la Carrière and Place d'Alliance in Nancy\", summed up as Place Stanislas, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site of France. Located in the Alsace-Lorraine-Champagne-Ardenne region, the Place Stanislas, Place Carrière and Place d’Alliance in Nancy comprise one of the most harmonious urban landscapes of the Enlightenment, illustrating in an exemplary and masterful way the idea of the royal square as an urban, monumental and central space. Stanislas Leszczynski, father-in-law of Louis XV, king of France, and unhappy pretender to the Polish throne received in compensation for his abdication the dukedoms of Lorraine for life. He reigned from 1737 to 1766. The town planning works of Nancy are the most beautiful achievements of the patronage of this prince."
