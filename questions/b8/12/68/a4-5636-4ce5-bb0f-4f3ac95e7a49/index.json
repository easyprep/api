  "question": "With reference to the discussions surrounding the ‘lost continent’ Great Adria, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The continent was a part of the African continent.</li>\r\n<li>The Alps represents the remnants of this ancient continent.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe Great Adria is now underneath Southern Europe. It was formed 240 million years ago from Gondwana and was a part of the African tectonic plate. However, it was separated from the African continent by an ocean. Over time, it subducted under the Eurasian tectonic plate.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nWhen the Great Adria was subducted, parts of it were scrapped off. This was some 100 million to 120 million years ago. Mountain chains like the Alps were formed from these scrapped off portions of the continent. The scientists had reported their findings about the history of this ancient continent in journal Gondwana Research.\r\n&nbsp;"
