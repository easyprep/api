  "answer": "Henderson Island",
  "explanation": "Henderson Island is located between New Zealand and Chile in the Pacific Ocean. Recently, researchers have tagged the island as the most polluted and remotest island of the world after they spotted the highest density of plastic debris on the island than anywhere else on the planet. The earth system called south pacific gyre, a large system of circulating ocean current has been held responsible for the collection of waste over the island. The waste dumped in oceans by various countries is carried by the sea currents and this waste congregates on the island."
