  "question": "If the radius of the earth were shrink by one per cent , its mass remaining the same, which of the following will happen to the value of ‘g’?",
  "option1": "Increase by 0.5%",
  "option2": "increase by 2%",
  "option3": "decrease by 0.5%",
  "option4": "decrease by 2%",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "increase by 2%",
  "explanation": "The force of gravity at the Earth\\'s surface would increase slightly as it is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses. If you decrease that distance to 99%, then everybody\\'s weight (and the acceleration due to gravity) would increase by (approximately) 2.03%."
