It is the most important river in South America that does not flow into the Atlantic Ocean or any of its marginal seas. This river originates from the Andes and the Chimborazo Volcano. This river starts its course at the confluence of Daule River and Babahoyo River. Then the river meets the Gulf of Guayaquil, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, after forming a complex delta and a slough called Estero Salado."
