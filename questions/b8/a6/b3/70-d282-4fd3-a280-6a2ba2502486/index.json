  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The compost itself is beneficial for the land in many ways, including as a soil conditioner, a fertilizer, addition of vital humus or humic acids, and as a natural pesticide for soil. In ecosystems, compost is useful for erosion control, land and stream reclamation, wetland construction, and as landfill cover (see compost uses). Organic ingredients intended for composting canal ternatively be used to generate biogas through a naerobic digestion. Anaerobic digestion is fast overtaking composting in some parts of the world including central Europe as a primary means of down cycling waste organic matter. <strong>Advant</strong><strong>ages</strong>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>1.
