  "question": "Recently, the Government has renamed the National Bamboo Mission (NBM) as National Agro-Forestry &amp; Bamboo Mission (NABM). In this context, consider the following statements: <ol> <li>The new mission is an initiative under the Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests (MoEF)</li> <li>Under the Indian Forest Act, 1927, bamboos cultivated on forest and non-forest land are classified as grass</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because the scheme is an initiative under the Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Farmers Welfare. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u>. Recently, the President promulgated the Indian Forest (Amendment) Ordinance, 2017 to amend the Indian Forest Act, 1927. Before this amendment, bamboo grown in forest as well as non forest area was classified as tree. With this amendment, bamboos grown in non-forest area have been omitted from definition of Tress. The Bamboo plantation programme in the forest areas is being implemented through the Forest Development Agencies (FDA) and the Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMCs). However, in case of Non-Forest Areas, the Bamboo Development Agencies (BDAs) are the nodal agency to whom funds will be released by the Ministry of Agriculture for onward disbursement to the beneficiaries."
