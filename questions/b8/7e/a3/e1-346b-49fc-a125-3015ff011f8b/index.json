It is expected to be the extremely severe category of cyclones with wind speeds reaching 200 kmph. The cyclone is expected to move towards the Oman coast and will probably not make landfall in India. It is expected to bring rains to Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nIt is a post-monsoon cyclone. The period is reported to be the most conducive for such cyclones. The south-west monsoon starts retreating in late September and by October, the winter monsoon sets in. Cyclone Kyarr is the first post-monsoon cyclone of 2019."
