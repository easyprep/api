  "option3": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The power to issue writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari rests with Supreme Court, High Courts and any other court as defined by Parliament by law. However lower courts can get this power only when parliament enacts a law and there is a call to make such a law which gives power to issue writs to district courts. High Courts would be relieved of their burden if the writ jurisdiction was given to district courts too. At the same time, we should keep in mind that Article 32 of the Constitution gives an extensive original jurisdiction to the Supreme Court in regard to enforcement of Fundamental Rights. It is empowered to issue directions, orders or writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari to enforce them."
