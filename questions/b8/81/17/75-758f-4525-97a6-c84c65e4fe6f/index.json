  "question": "Which of the following is the reason behind bleeding through nose in high mountain regions?",
  "option1": "The pressure of the blood capillaries is higher than the outside pressure",
  "option2": "The pressure at high altitudes is greater than that in the plains",
  "option3": "The blood pressure increases at high altitudes",
  "option4": "The blood pressure decreases at high altitudes",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "The pressure of the blood capillaries is higher than the outside pressure",
  "explanation": "As altitude increases, the availability of oxygen decreases, making the air thinner and drier. Dry climates can cause drying and cracking inside the nose, which can lead to a nosebleed. The climate inside nose gets drier. This makes the blood vessels exposed inside your nose more likely to burst there than at lower altitudes."
