  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Brahma Marriage is one of the eight ways to perform a marriage according to the Dharma Shastras, the treatises on religious duty (dharma). In a Brahma marriage the bride’s father gives away his daughter, along with any ornaments he can afford, to a learned man of good character. This man is respectfully invited to accept her with absolutely no conditions or fees. This form is considered the most suitable for Brahmans because it is free from lust or any sort of financial inducements, hence the name Brahma marriage. For these reasons it is also deemed the best of the four approved (prashasta) forms of marriage. The Brahma marriage is one of the two forms practiced in modern India. It is by far the more socially respectable, since the asura marriage—in which the groom gives money to the bride and her family—carries the connotation of selling the bride. Yet even with the Brahma marriage, there has been significant divergence from the classically mandated form. In many modern Indian weddings, it has become common for the bride’s family to give the groom’s family a dowry as a condition for the marriage, which can easily be interpreted as selling the groom.
