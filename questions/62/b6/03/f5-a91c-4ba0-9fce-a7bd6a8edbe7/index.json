  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Wasteland Development itself refers to the development of degraded land into productive land, which can provide bio-mass. It would result in water conservation when it is integrated with water harvesting / protection. A country which exports more food items is likely to consume more water. Thus, meat export will consumer virtual water and that is the reason that vegetarnaiasm is promoted for conservation of water."
