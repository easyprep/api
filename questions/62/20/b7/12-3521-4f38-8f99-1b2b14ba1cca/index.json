  "explanation": "Iceland houses the glacial canyon \"Asbyrgi\". It is a glacial canyon and forest in the north of Iceland, located on the Diamond Circle road. The horseshoe-shaped depression is part of the Vatnajokull National Park. The canyon's steep sides are formed by cliffs. Asbyrgi was most likely formed by catastrophic glacial flooding of the river Jokulsa a Fjollum after the last Ice Age, first 8-10,000 years ago, and then again some 3,000 years ago.",
