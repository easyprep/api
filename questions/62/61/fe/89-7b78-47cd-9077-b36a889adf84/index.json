  "question": "With reference to the recent research studying the behavioural aspect of farmer suicides, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Depression is a leading cause of farmer suicides.</li>\n<li>The 7D model includes depression as one of its aspects.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe research studied the behavioural facet of farmer suicides in India for the first time. The study by ICAR and Punjab Agricultural University listed depression as one of the leading causes. This is seen from how a farmer under a debt of 2 lakh INR showed suicidal tendencies while another under a 10 lakh INR debt did not.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe study has evolved a 7D model for the research in Punjab, Telangana and Maharashtra. Depression is one of the modelâ€™s facet. The other Ds are death, dispute, disrepute, drugs, disease and debt. These are the factors that were found to trigger and confound the suicide problem."
