  "question": "In context with the recent discussions about article 142 with respect to the Ayodhya verdict, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>This is the first time the court has made use of its provisions.</li>\n<li>It for providing ‘complete justice’.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe article 142 has been used previously by the apex court. Eg: Supreme Court banned sale of liquors on highways in 2017 under the provisions of this article. However, its use in the Ayodhya case is the first such use for a civil dispute involving immovable property.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nArticle 142 of the constitution provides the SC power to pass any decree for delivering ‘complete justice’ in a case before it. Over years, what constitutes ‘complete justice’ has been debated. The article however does not provide limitless powers."
