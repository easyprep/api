  "question": "What is the wavelength of a stationary wave?",
  "option1": "twice the distance between two consecutive nodes or antinodes",
  "option2": "equal to the distance between two consecutive nodes or antinodes",
  "option3": "half the distance between two consecutive nodes or antinodes",
  "option4": "four times the distance between two consecutive nodes or antinodes",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "twice the distance between two consecutive nodes or antinodes",
  "explanation": "Wavelength (<span class=\\'symbol\\'>Î»</span>) of a progressive wave is the distance between two consecutive points of the same phase at a given time. In a stationary wave, it is twice the distance between two consecutive nodes or antinodes."
