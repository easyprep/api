  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "When corals face stress by changes in conditions such as temperature, light, or nutrients, they expel the symbiotic algae zooxanthellae living in their tissues, causing them to turn completely white. This phenomenon is called coral bleaching.<br />El Nino elevates the sea temperature and destroys coral reefs.<br />Over-fishing, pollution from agricultural and industrial runoff, coral mining, development of industrial areas near coral ecosystems also adversely impact corals."
