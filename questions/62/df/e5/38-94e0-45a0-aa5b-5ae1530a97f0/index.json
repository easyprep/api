  "question": "With reference to the government announcing a last-mile funding initiative for incomplete housing, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Delhi has the highest number of stalled housing units in India.</li>\n<li>Only the RERA and not the IBC Act figures provisions for compensating homebuyers.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nDelhi NCR has the highest number of stalled housing units in the country. There are around 1.18 lakh homes spread over 67 projects with an overall value of 82,200 crore INR. The next highest numbers occur in Mumbai and Pune. The NBFC crisis is one of the reasons.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nBoth acts have different provisions for homebuyers. The SC upheld the applicability of IBC act for homebuyers to seek compensation. Before its amendment in 2018, the IBC did not include homebuyers as one of the parties to be compensated. The RERA requires the promoters to comply with the purchase deal and hence protect the buyers.\n&nbsp;"
