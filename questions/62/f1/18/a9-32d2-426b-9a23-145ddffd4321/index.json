  "option1": "The blood pressure of a person increases at high altitudes",

  "option3": "The pressure at high altitudes is greater than that on the plains",
  "option4": "The blood pressure fluctuates and finally decreases drastically",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "The blood pressure of a person increases at high altitudes",
  "explanation": "At high altitudes, there is less oxygen available. This makes the air thinner and drier. The climate inside your nose also gets drier because of this. This makes the blood vessels exposed inside your nose more likely to burst there than at lower altitudes."
