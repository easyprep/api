  "question": "If a moving body turns its speed to 1.5 times, what will be the impact on its kinetic energy?",
  "option1": "will become 1.5 times",
  "option2": "will become 3 times",
  "option3": "will become 2.25 times",
  "option4": "will become 6 times",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "will become 2.25 times",
  "explanation": "Kinetic Energy is a product of half the Mass times Velocity Squared. When the velocity is doubled, the Kinetic energy would go up four times. If velocity is tripled, kinetic energy would go up nine times. If velocity is increased by 1.5 times the Kinetic energy would go up by 1.5x1.5=2.25 times."
