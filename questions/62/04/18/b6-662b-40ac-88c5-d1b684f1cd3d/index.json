  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The first statement is correct. With this act, the East India Company’s rule came to an end and the Indian administration came under the direct control of the Crown.<br />The second statement is also correct as in England, the Court of Directors and Board of Control were abolished. In their place came the Secretary of State for India and India Council were established. The Secretary of State would be a member of the British cabinet. Sir Charles Wood was made the first Secretary of State for India. India Council consisting of 15 members would assist him. The Governor General of India was also made the Viceroy of India. The first Viceroy of India was Lord Canning.<br />The third statement is incorrect because all the previous treaties were accepted and honored by the Act. As per this declaration, all treaties and agreements made with the Indian native princes under the authority of the East India company did not cease to exist but were there to stay and accepted by the crown."
