  "question": "Among Alpha, Beta and Gamma radiations:<br> 1. The Alpha Particles have highest ionising power but least penetrating power<br> 2. The Gamma radiations have highest penetration power but lowest ionising power<br> Which among the above is / are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "<strong>?-particles </strong> <ol> <li>They are doubly ionised helium nuclei having a mass equal to 6.64 × 10–27 kg and charge equal to 3.2 × l0–19 C.</li> <li>They have the highest ionising power.</li> <li>They have the least penetrating power.</li> <li>They produce fluorescence in the zinc sulphide screen.</li> </ol> &nbsp; <strong>?-particles</strong>. <ol> <li>They are negatively charged particles, having a charge equal to –1.6 × 10– 19 C and mass 9.1 × 10–31 kg.</li> <li>They have more penetration power than ?-particles.</li> <li>They have less ionising power than ?-particles.</li> <li>They affect photographic plate.</li> </ol> &nbsp; <strong>?-radiations </strong> <ol> <li>They are electromagnetic waves, having wavelength less than 0.01 Å.</li> <li>They have a very high penetration power.</li> <li>They have a very low ionising power.</li> <li>They are not affected by electric or magnetic fields.</li> </ol> Notes on Ionising power If one unit is ionising power of ?-radiations, then 100 units is ionising power of ?-particles and 10000 units is the ionising power of ?-particles. <strong>Notes on Penetration power </strong> ?-radiations can penetrate even 30 cm of iron. ?-particles can penetrate 1mm of lead or 5 mm of aluminium. ?-particles can penetrate 2.7 to 8.6 cm of air"
