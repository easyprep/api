  "option4": 1948,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 1946,
  "explanation": "The Muslim Leagueâ€™s Direct Action (anti-Hindu attacks) in Calcutta from 16 August 1946 onwards was extended to Noakhali district in the Chittagong Division in East Bengal (Now in Bangladesh) in October 1946. The Muslim community perpetrated a series of massacres, rapes, abductions and forced conversions of Hindus, desecration of temples, and looting and arson of Hindu properties in October-November 1946. The Noakhali genocide was far worse than the Calcutta carnage that preceded it. About 5000 Hindus were killed, hundreds of Hindu women were raped, thousands of Hindu men and women were forcibly converted to Islam, and about 75,000 survivors had fled, and to be sheltered in temporary relief camps. Gandhi camped in Noakhali for about four months to restore peace and communal amity. But, he failed."
