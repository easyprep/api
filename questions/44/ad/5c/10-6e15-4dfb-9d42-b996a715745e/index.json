  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Annexation of Oudh",
  "explanation": "Annexation of Oudh in February 1856 was a very important decision taken by Lord Dalhousie. But the annexation of Oudh was surely the company’s and Dalhousie’s worst blunder. It proved disadvantageous for the English as the people of Oudh strongly participated in the Revolt of 1857. The English used their giant`s strength and had injured their reputation in the eyes of the Indians. During the Revolt of 1857, the sepoys of Oudh had brought about havoc and had added to the difficulties of the British. It is said that the forced abduction of Wajid Ali Shah and annexation of Oudh were offences against good faith and public conscience."
