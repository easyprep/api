  "question": "In light of the recent announcement about mandatory hallmarking of gold jewellery, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Gold jewellery can be sold only in the caratages of 10, 18 and 22.</li>\r\n<li>Gold artefacts of 14 carats can be sold without hallmarking.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe ministry of consumer affairs had recently announced that gold jewels and artefacts cannot be sold without hallmarking. The jewellery will be issued only in 3 caratages with the hallmarks- 14, 18 and 22 carats. The hallmarking is done by the Bureau of Indian Standards.  \r\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe centre has announced that the earlier practice of issuing 10 grades of gold will no longer be continued. Only the 3 caratages of 14, 18 and 22 carats will be continued. If these are sold without hallmarking, the seller will invite penalty of up to 5 times the cost of the object and even imprisonment."
