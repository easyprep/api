  "answer": "Sri Lanka",
  "explanation": "Sri Lanka has become first South Asian nation to criminalise several offences related to match-fixing. The move comes after Sri Lankan parliament passed of a bill related to it labelled as “Prevention of Offences Related to Sports”. Sri Lanka’s Sports Ministry worked closely with International Cricket Council’s (ICC) Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU) during the process of drafting bill. \r\nThe newest legislation covers all sports. As per it if a person is found guilty of committing an offence related to corruption in sports, then he may find himself jailed for a term up to 10 years and will also be required to pay other fines.The bill criminalises ‘acts of omission’, which includes failure to report corrupt approaches. This means that, Sri Lankan cricketers who are approached by corruptors will now have to report these approaches not only to ICC’s ACU, but also to a Special Investigation Unit (SIU) appointed by Sri Lankan government."
