  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Saranda region is well known for its iron deposits. The state government is looking to open up iron ore mines in the region after a reassessment. Earlier, the Bisht committee and other institutes like Wildlife Institute of India and Indian Council of Forest Research and Training recommended preservation of the region from mining. The SC in 2016 had cancelled the mining leases.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Saranda forest is the largest Sal tree forest in Asia. The rocky soil of the area is favourable for this trees’ growth. It is a deciduous variety and sheds its leaves in summer. The region has animals like elephants, leopards, bisons, etc."
