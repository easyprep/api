  "question": "With reference to the recent declaration of locust emergencies in several countries, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The locusts are a type of grasshoppers.</li>\n<li>Swarming of locusts is called a plague.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe locusts are a type of grasshoppers. They are known for their ability to migrate over long distances (up to 150km in a day) and multiply rapidly. These short-horned grasshoppers are considered a major agricultural pest and they attack many parts of the plant and are polyphagous.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe locusts exhibit swarming behaviour and these destructive swarms are called plagues. These plagues are considered as natural disasters. Currently, Pakistan and Somalia have declared locust emergencies. Of the three regions highlighted by FAO as worst hit (Horn of Africa, Red Sea area and southwest Asia), the African countries are worst affected."
