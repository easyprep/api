  "question": "Consider the following statements about the Alluvium soil in India: <ol> <li>Alluvial soil is formed in situ</li> <li>It is found only in the Ganga-Yamuna plain</li> <li>Alluvial soil is rich in nitrogen and humus and thus does not need continued use of manure and fertilizers</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Only 3",
  "option4": "None",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None",
  "explanation": "First statement is incorrect because almost all soils of India except for alluvial soils and some of the desert and forest soils have been formed <em>in situ. </em>Alluvial soil is formed by transported parent material. Second statement is also incorrect because alluvial soil also occurs in the valleys of Narmada and the Tapti in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat, the Mahanadi in Chhattisgarh and Odisha, and also along the Godavari and Kaveri in Tamil Nadu. The coastal alluvial soil is of tidal origin. The coastal alluvial soil is rich in plant nutrients and supports a good crop. The deposits are rich in calcium and magnesium and contain decomposed organic matter. Third statement is incorrect because alluvial soil is deficient in nitrogen and humus but rich in potash and thus need continued use of manure and fertilizers for good yields. The color varies from light grey to ash-grey and texture is sandy to silty loam."
