  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Muslim League",
  "explanation": "The Third Round Table Conference was held in London between 17 November 1932 and 24 December 1932. The Muslim League (Muhammad Ali, Agha Khan, Fazlul Haq, Jinnah, etc.) and others attended it. The British Labour Party refused to attend it; and the Indian National Congress too remained absent. However, the RTCâ€™s outcome was highly significant and path-breaking. Its output was the White Paper issued by the Government, on the basis of which the Government of India Act 1935 took shape under the supervision of the Secretary of State for India, Sir Samuel Hoare. And, it is this act on which the Indian Constitution of 1950 derives significantly."
