For implementing this clause, the B K Sharma committee was constituted.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe recent plea submitted by a group of retired officers claims that the valley is not party to the Accord. The people of the region have a distinctive mix of ethnicity like Nepalis, Bengalis, Santhalis, Nagas, etc. The region also has its own distinctive language, culture and history.\r\n&nbsp;"
