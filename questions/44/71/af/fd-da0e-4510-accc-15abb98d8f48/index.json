  "question": "With respect to the recent calls for rights for intersex children, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>No country in the world has a legal regime for ensuring the rights of the intersex children.</li>\r\n<li>Intersex individuals are also called as transgender individuals.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe rights of intersex children are ensured by legal regime in two countries- Malta and Taiwan. The Tamil Nadu government had banned surgeries on children to ‘treat intersex condition’ unless it is life threatening. Rights group are calling for nation wide imposition of this ban.\r\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe term ‘intersex’ and ‘transgender’ are different from each other. In transgender individuals, the sex of an individual is different from what was determined at birth. In case of an intersex individual, the physical and biological features cannot be categorised as typical male or female."
