  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nA study by Madras Crocodile Bank Trust, the gharial population faces major threat from sand mining in the state. This leads to habitat loss along the river banks. The effect is especially from the illegal sand mining in the Son Gharial sanctuary region.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nGharials are freshwater inhabitants that are spread across the northern part of Indian subcontinent. However, they are found only in 2% of their historical habitat now. Currently, they are found in Nepal and India. Earlier in 2015, a few gharials were reported in Bangladesh."
