  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3 are correct",
  "explanation": "Followers of Hinayana don’t believe in Idol Worship and try to attain individual salvation through self discipline and meditation. So there is no place for idol worship in Hinayana , so no question of Boddhisatvas. In Mahayana, both Buddha’s idols as well as Bodhisattvas are venerated."
