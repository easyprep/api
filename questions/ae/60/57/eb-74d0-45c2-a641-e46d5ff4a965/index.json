  "option1": "1 & 3 Only",
  "option2": "3 Only",
  "option3": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "All of the above are found in Deserts<br> Oases are found in the middle of deserts. Oasis is a fertile tract of land that occurs in a desert wherever a perennial supply of fresh water is available, and it also contains one or more springs surrounded by vegetation. Yardangs are commonly found in flat deserts where steady winds blow away dust and tilt. They are the result of sand grains pushed by persistent winds to form low ridges of sand carved in soft rock. Barkhans are temporary type of sand-dunes and are generally formed in desert plains where large amount of sand is available. They are dunes with a concave slope facing the coming winds and the slope on the leeward side is gentle and forms a tail of the dune."
