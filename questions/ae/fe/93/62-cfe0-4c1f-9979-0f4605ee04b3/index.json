  "question": "With reference to the discussions surrounding freedom of press in India, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>India is among the top 100 countries ranked by the World Press Freedom Index.</li>\n<li>Indian constitution has a separate provision for freedom of press.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",

  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe World Press Freedom Index is published by the Reporters Sans Borders (RSB), a non-profit organisation. In this year’s report, India has fallen to the 140<sup>th</sup> spot- 2 spots lower than the previous ranking. This is the rank out of the 180 countries studied. The report says that atleast 6 journalists were killed in relation to their work in 2018.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:    </strong>\nThe Indian Constitution does not give a separate provision for media freedom. This is, however, covered by the freedom of speech and expression under article 19. The right is subject to certain restrictions i.e., the freedom can be restricted for sake of national security, to prevent incitement to offence, defamation, etc."
