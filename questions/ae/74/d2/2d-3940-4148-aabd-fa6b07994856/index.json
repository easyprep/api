  "question": "<strong>Thermal plasma technology</strong> for waste treatment: <ol> <li>has been developed by Institute of Chemical Technology(ICT),Mumbai.</li> <li>converts hazardous &amp; toxic compounds into organic and inorganic materials at normal temperature and pressure (NTP).</li> <li>converts inorganic materials to flue gases and organic material to vitrified mass.</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 and 3 Only",
  "option3": "1,2 and 3",
  "option4": "None",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None",
  "explanation": "First statement is wrong because the technology has been develoed by <strong>Bhabha Atomic Research Centre.</strong>Second statement is wrong because the waste are broken down to elemental constituents of Organic and Inorganic at high temperatures above 6000C and not at normal temperature and pressure.Third statement is also wrong because Inorganic materials are converted to Vitrified Mass; and Organic materials are Pyrolysed or Gasified, Converted to flue gases (H2 &amp; CO) &amp; Lower hydrocarbon gases when operated at low temperature (500 &ndash; 600OC)."
