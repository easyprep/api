Upon launch, it will become the first mission to Mars by any Arab or Muslim country. The aim of the  mission is to enrich the capabilities of Emirati engineers and to  increase human knowledge about the Martian atmosphere. The Hope probe will study the atmospheric layers of Mars in detail and will provide data to study the causes of the corrosion of its surface that has made it impossible for water to exist on the planet. The project will also provide insights about the weather on the Red Planet. It will observe weather phenomena such as dust storms and changes in temperature and how the atmosphere interacts with topography, from the highest volcano peaks to ice sheets to the vast deserts and the deepest canyons.  It is expected to reach Mars in 2021, which coincides with the 50th anniversary of the UAE\\'s formation."
