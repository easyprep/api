  "question": "In context with the recent studies about the Pulpi Geode, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The Pulpi Geode is in Spain.</li>\n<li>These geodes are made of gypsum.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Pulpi Geode is a gigantic crystal formation in Spain. It is found in an abandoned silver mine in the Almeria Province. It was abandoned in 1999. The crystals here are about 7 feet long and are some of the largest geodes in the world.\nÂ <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe crystals are made of gypsum. The particular type of gypsum (a calcium mineral) is called selenite. Geodes are geological formations of cavities in sedimentary and volcanic rocks. These cavities contain mineral matter which may develop into crystals. A recent study found that ancient climate change and nucleation by smaller crystals lead to the growth of the gigantic crystals in the Pulpi Geode.\n&nbsp;"
