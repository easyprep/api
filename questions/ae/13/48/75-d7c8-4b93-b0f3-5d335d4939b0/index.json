  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nAfter the dissolution and merger, the erstwhile NIMH will fall under the ministry of health and family welfare. The National Institute of Occupational Health was set up in 1970, in collaboration with WHO. It falls under the MoH&amp;FW. It also works with the ministries for labour, environment, agriculture, etc.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe occupational safety, health and working conditions code was introduced in Lok Sabha. It provides for free health check-up for employees in institutions employing more than 10 workers. It does not apply to apprentices. It seeks to replace 13 laws on the subjects of occupation safety, health and working conditions.\n<strong>Statement 3</strong> is incorrect:\nThe provision for a safe and humane working condition is provided for by article 42 of the constitution. It also provides for maternity benefits. Other articles that provide for occupational health and safety are article 24, that prohibits child labour and article 39 that provides for health protection of workers."
