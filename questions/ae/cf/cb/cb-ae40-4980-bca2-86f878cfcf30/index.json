It provides free dialysis service to people below the poverty line (BPL). However, it also benefits people in categories other than the BPL- they can avail the service at the same cost as paid by the government at close-by district hospitals.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe program functions on public private partnership model. It involves the private sector to aid the public sector in providing free dialysis service to the people. It enables the supplementation of human resource, dialysis machinery, infrastructure, power supply, etc."
