  "question": "The President recently ordered the extension of the Inner Line Permit system to Manipur. With reference to this, consider the following statements about ILP:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>ILP applies to Nagaland.</li>\n<li>ILP is required for both inward and outward movement from these states.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe ILP system is applicable to Nagaland also. Manipur became the 4<sup>th</sup> state to get the system after Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram. The extension was done in context with the recent enactment of the amended citizenship act. This is intended to protect the interest of the indigenous people of the state.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nILP is intended only for inward movement into the state. It is a document issued by the government as a permit for outsiders to enter and stay in these states under the ILP regime. The system originated from the provisions of the Bengal Eastern frontier Regulations of 1873."
