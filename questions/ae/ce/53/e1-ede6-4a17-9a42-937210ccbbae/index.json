  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Punchhi committee was set up in 2007 under the chairmanship of Justice Madan Mohan Punchhi. It submitted a report on centre- state relations. It recommended that pre-poll coalition and alliance to be treated as one political party and in case of majority, the leader of the coalition is to become the CM.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Punchhi committee also included post-electoral alliances in its report. It recommended that the governor may select the leader from such a coalition in absence of clear majority. However it is one of the lower preference scenarios compared to those involving pre-poll alliances."
