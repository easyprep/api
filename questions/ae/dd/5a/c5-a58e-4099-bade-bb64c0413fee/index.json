  "answer": "Gender and Oceans",
  "explanation": "The World Oceans Day (WOD) is observed every year on June 8  to celebrate the majesty of the world\\'s oceans and raise awareness about their preservation. Oceans are important for mankind because they generate an estimated 70% of the earth\\'s oxygen. They regulate the globe\\'s climate and weather. They support marine life. They provide us with food, and ingredients for many of our medicines. But our oceans and marine life are under threat: from pollution and overfishing. Hence, the day aims to address these challenges. The 2019 conservation action theme “Gender and Oceans” reflects on equalizing the representation of women and men in marine fields. It highlights the important role gender equality has to play in ensuring effective conservation of our oceans, seas and marine life. The focus of the day is to inspire a worldwide fight against plastic pollution."
