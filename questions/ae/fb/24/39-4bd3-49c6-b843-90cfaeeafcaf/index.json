  "question": "Who of the following develops electronic device that mimics human brain, recently?",
  "option1": "Vinod Kumar Sangwan",
  "option2": "Sankar Kumar Pal",
  "option3": "Soumen Chakrabarti",
  "option4": "Avinash Kak",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Vinod Kumar Sangwan",
  "explanation": "Scientists at Northwestern University, USA, headed by an Indian, have developed \"Memtransistor\", an electronic device that can mimic the human brain. It has been designed by Dr Vinod Kumar Sangwan (Indian), a post-doctoral researcher at Northwestern University and a team of scientists. Memtransistor combines the functions of a memristor and a transistor. The memtransistor has great potential in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Dr Vinod Kumar Sangwan said that, their work is presently at fundamental level. They are working on a realistic design for a full neural-network system. This device is said to have futuristic applications in health sector.",
