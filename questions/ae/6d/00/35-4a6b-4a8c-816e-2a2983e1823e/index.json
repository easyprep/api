  "explanation": "The Sadar Diwani Adalat was the Supreme Court of Revenue in British India established at Calcutta by Warren Hastings in 1772. It was reformed in 1780 and again in 1793 by the British Parliament. The court's judges were the Governor General and Council Members of the East India Company, assisted by native judges and officers of revenue. The court was established to allow Hindu Indians to be governed by Hindu law in matters of property, and not as before by Muslim law, although they were still subject to Muslim criminal law. The court was abolished after the Indian Rebellion of 1857."
