  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "None of the above",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nSand is considered minor mineral under the Mines and Minerals act. The act was passed in 1957 and amended in 2016. It regulates and gives the framework for mining operations in India. The amendments provide for more transparency in mining block allocation, setting up of National Mineral Exploration Trust, punishments for illegal mining, trespassing, etc.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe Sustainable Sand Mining Management Guidelines, 2016 says that sand removed and sold from agricultural fields after flood doesnâ€™t count as mining. But this is only so far as the land is reclaimed. Other activities that are discounted as mining under this frameworks are clay extraction for pottery, cottage industry, community works undertaken under MGNREGS, etc. The framework was formed by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nRadioactive minerals and coal are beyond the purview of the act. The Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 deals with coal allocation in India. It is a denationalisation step of coal mines. The radioactive minerals are under the Atomic Energy act, 1962."
