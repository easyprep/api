Rani Rashmoni had played an important role in the spread of education in the state. She was the founder of the Dakshineswar Kali Temple, Kolkata. Her other construction works include the construction of a road from Subarnarekha River to Puri for the pilgrims, Babughat (also known as Babu Rajchandra Das Ghat), Ahiritola Ghat and Nimtola Ghat for the everyday bathers at the Ganges.
