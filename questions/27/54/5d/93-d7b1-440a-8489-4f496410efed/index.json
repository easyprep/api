  "answer": "All of them",
  "explanation": "In 1956, United States decided to withdraw its offer of a grant to aid the construction of Egyptâ€™s Aswan High Dam. The president Gamal Abdel Nasser, who was always willing to stand against the western powers and Israel, responded this by nationalization of the Suez Canal. This was not acceptable to the governments of Britain and France which had vested interests in the Suez Canal. So, an invasion was planned for Egypt. Israel too had its own hostile plans. This began a series of international negotiations which all failed and in October 1956, Britain and France agreed to carry out a joint intervention in Egypt. This was followed by an Anglo-French ultimatum, which called for Israelis and Egyptians to withdraw their forces to a distance of 10 miles from the Suez Canal. The ultimatum demanded that Egypt should allow British and French forces to temporarily occupy key positions guarding the canal. The US remained in background by now. There was an Anglo-French attack on Egypt began on 31 October with a series of large-scale air strikes. Later Israel also joined and thus Egypt was attacked by 3 allies viz. British, French and Israelis."
