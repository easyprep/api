  "question": "The regulation of fly ash has been in the news recently. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Fly ash is also called flue ash.</li>\n<li>In India, most of the fly ash is of the F-class.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nFly ash is also known as flue ash. It is a product of combustion of coal. It has variable composition but mainly has silicon dioxide and oxides of calcium and aluminium. It is generated by coal powered boilers along with flue gases, hence the name.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe fly ash in India is mostly of the C-class. F-class fly ash is mostly found in European countries. While C-class or calcareous class of fly ash possesses hydraulic properties, the F-class fly ash does not. This limits the utilisation of the Indian variety of fly ash."
