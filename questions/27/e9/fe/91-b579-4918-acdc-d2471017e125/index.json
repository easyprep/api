  "question": "Which among the following statements is/are correct about the Angle of Repose?",
  "option1": "It is dependent upon the internal coherence of a material",
  "option2": "Softer, looser material has a higher angle of repose",
  "option3": "Rocks and compressed sediments has a lower angle of repose",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "It is dependent upon the internal coherence of a material",
  "explanation": "Angle of Repose is the steepest angle that can be assumed by loose fragments on a slope without down slope movement.<br />Angle of Repose is dependent upon the internal coherence of the material.<br />Softer, looser material has lower angle of repose.<br />Rock and compressed sediments have very high angles of repose."
