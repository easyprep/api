  "question": "Consider the following differences between Epeirogenic movement and Orogenic movement of Earth: <ol> <li>While the epeirogenic movement of earth is also known as continental building movement, the orogenic movement is known for mountain building</li> <li>The orogenic movement of earth is faster than epeirogenic movement of earth</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Both are correct statements<br> The orogenic movements generally occur more rapidly than the epeirogenic movements. The earth movements inÂ­volving a vertical or radial displacement of rocks are called epeirogenic or continent building movements. On the other hand, the mountain building movement of earth is called orogenic movement.The orogenic movements generally occur more rapidly than the epeirogenic movements."
