  "question": "Which orbital will have lower energy if two orbitals have the same value of (n+l)?",
  "option1": "orbital with lower value of n",
  "option2": "orbital with lower value of l",
  "option3": "orbital with lower value of (n-l)",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "orbital with lower value of n",
  "explanation": "If two orbitals have the same value of (n+l) then orbital with lower value of n will have lower energy. Also, energies of the orbitals in the same subshell decrease with increase in atomic number."
