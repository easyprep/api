  "answer": "Only 2, 3, & 4",
  "explanation": "In case of Sind and Baluchistan, the provincial assemblies were powered to take the decision. In case of NWFP, the decision had to be taken on the base of referendum. A referendum was to be organized in Sylhet region of Assam which was Muslim majority. The Nawab of Junagarh Mohammad Mahabat Khanji III, wanted to accede to Pakistan despite having no common border with Pakistan. Two states in suzerainty of Junagarh viz. Mangrol and Babariawad rebelled and Nawab acquired them militarily. Some other states reacted and they asked the Government of India to intervene. A government in exile was formed by Samaldas Gandhi. A referendum was held which favored its merger with India.<br> Indian forces cut off supplies to Junagarh and acquired the territories which had acceded to India. The Nawab fled to Pakistan, after emptying the state treasury and later the court of Junagarh requested Government of India to take over."
