  "question": "With respect to the recent efforts to control Australia’s wildfires, consider the following statements about the concept of ‘prescribed burning’:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It is the intentional setting of fire as part of forest management.</li>\r\n<li>It is also known as back burning.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nPrescribed fire or controlled fire is the intentionally setting of fire to flammable growths in forests as a part of forest management. It was debated as a potential solution for Australia’s wildfires. The practice is usually carried out during cooler months.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe controlled fire is not the same as back burning. Back burning is the technique used to slow down an approaching fire by reducing the amount of fuel available for the main forest front. This is achieved by making a fire burn against the prevailing wind."
