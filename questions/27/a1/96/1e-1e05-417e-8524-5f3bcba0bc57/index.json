  "question": "At which among the following points, the high tides are lower than usual and low tides are higher than usual?",
  "option1": "New Moon",
  "option2": "Full Moon",
  "option3": "Apogee",
  "option4": "Perigee",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Apogee",
  "explanation": "Apogee is the farthest point of the moon from the earth. When the moon is at apogee, the furthest distance from the Earth, it has less gravitational pull which, along with other factors that influence the tides, can contribute to lower tides or lower variation in the high/low tide level."
