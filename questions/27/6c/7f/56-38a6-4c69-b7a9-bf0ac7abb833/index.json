  "question": "Which among the following statement is correct about Fluorescence?",
  "option1": "High Energy Photon is absorbed and low energy photon is emitted",
  "option2": "Low Energy Photon is absorbed and high energy photon is emitted",
  "option3": "High Energy Photon is absorbed and electron is emitted",
  "option4": "Low Energy Photon is absorbed and electron is emitted",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "High Energy Photon is absorbed and electron is emitted",
  "explanation": "Fluorescence is the emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation. It is a form of luminescence. In most cases, the emitted light has a longer wavelength, and therefore lower energy, than the absorbed radiation. High Energy Photon is absorbed and electron is emitted."
