  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "The Indian Central Council of Research in Homoeopathy and Ministry of Ayush celebrated the World Homoeopathy Day-2018 by holding a National Convention on April 10-11 at Vigyan Bhavan in New Delhi. <u>First statement is incorrect</u> because World Homeopathy Day is celebrated on April 10 every year to commemorate the birth anniversary of the founder and father of Homoeopathy, Dr. Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician, who was a great scholar, linguist and acclaimed scientist. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u>. In India, homoeopathy is recognized and integrated in the National health care delivery system, but Homeopathy did not originated in India. It originated in Europe in the last part of the eighteenth century. Homeopathic remedies are regulated as drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). Homeopathy uses animal, plant, mineral, and synthetic substances in its preparations."
