  "question": "Harsha is known to have divided the State Income into equal parts that comprised_?  \r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Government Expenses</li>\r\n<li>Salary of Public Servants</li>\r\n<li>Rewards for intellectual attainments</li>\r\n<li>Gifts and donations</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1, 2 & 4",
  "option2": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option3": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option4": "1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "Land revenue was derived from a variety of taxes – from the land, and from various categories of produce at various stages of production. The maintenance of an imperial façade was a purposeless expense in economic terms and must have resulted in a pressure on the economy. It is not surprising that the later Gupta coinage indicates an economic crisis. The reference to Harsha dividing the national income into a quarter for government expenses, another quarter for the pay of public servants, a third quarter for the reward of intellectual attainments, and the last quarter for gifts, although idealistic in concept, may have been economically impractical."
