  "question": "The name of the new element that has been found with magnetic properties by the researchers of University of Minnesota is;",
  "option1": "Titanium (Tu)",
  "option2": "Vibranium (Vb)",
  "option3": "Ruthenium (Ru)",
  "option4": "Zylanium (Zy)",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Ruthenium (Ru)",
  "explanation": "The name of the chemical element is Ruthenium (Ru). It is the fourth such element to have magnetic properties. So far, Iron (Fe), cobalt (Co) and Nickel (Ni) has these similar properties. They are ferromagnetic at room temperature. These elements can be used for their magnetic properties for better sensors, in the computer memory and logic industry and other devices using magnetic materials.",
