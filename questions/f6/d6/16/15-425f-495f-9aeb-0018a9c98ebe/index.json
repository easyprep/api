Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code deals with rape cases, but makes an exception for marital rape in six cases. Indian Penal Code 498A deals with dowry laws. It is a criminal law (not a civil law). As per this section-Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine. The offence is Cognizable, non-compoundable and non-bailable."
