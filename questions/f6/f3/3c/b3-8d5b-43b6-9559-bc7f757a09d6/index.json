The Martha Farrell awards were instituted in memory of Martha Farrell, who was a passionate civil society leader, renowned and respected in India and around the world for her work on women\\'s rights, gender equality and adult education. The awards are given in two categories - \\'Most Promising Individual\\' and \\'Best Organization for Gender Equality\\' - to individuals and organizations working toward issues pertaining to gender equality. In the Gender Equality category, the 2019 award went to Mahila Jan Adhikar Samiti (MJAS), a women-led organisation which started as a collective of rural women and, eventually, transitioned into a registered organisation in 2000 to fight against domestic violence."
