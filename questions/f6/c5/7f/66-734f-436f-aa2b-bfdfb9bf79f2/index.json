  "question": "Bhakti saint Ramanujacharya was devotee of which god?",
  "option1": "Krishna",
  "option2": "Rama",
  "option3": "Vishnu",
  "option4": "Shiva",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Vishnu",
  "explanation": "Rāmānuja presented the epistemic and soteriological importance of bhakti, or the devotion to a personal God (Vishnu in Rāmānuja’s case) as a means to spiritual liberation. His theories assert that there exists a plurality and distinction between Ātman (soul) and Brahman (metaphysical, ultimate reality), while he also affirmed that there is unity of all souls and that the individual soul has the potential to realize identity with the Brahman."
