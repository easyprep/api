  "explanation": "The lion-tailed macaque or the wanderoo, is an Old World monkey endemic to the Western Ghats of South India. The lion-tailed macaque ranks among the rarest and most threatened primates. Their range has become increasingly isolated and fragmented by the spread of agriculture and tea, coffee, teak and cinchona, construction of water reservoirs for irrigation and power generation, and human settlements to support such activities."
