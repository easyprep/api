  "question": "A hologram showing a picture of a Rat is cut into two half then each half contains:",
  "option1": "Half picture of the Rat",
  "option2": "Full Picture of the Rat",
  "option3": "Distorted picture of the Rat",
  "option4": "Distorted or no Rat at all",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Full Picture of the Rat",
  "explanation": "Kindly read about the interference and diffraction physics in holography and know how Holograms work. A hologram itself is not a process but is the product of the process of Holography. Derived from the Greek ‘holosgrafe’ meaning ‘whole drawing’, holography — invented by physicist Dennis Gabor — is the process in which a coherent beam of light is scattered in two directions using a beam-splitter where one beam is directed towards the object, the other towards a mirror. After reflection off both the mediums the object wave of light and reflected wave meet at the photo film preferably holography film. If the film is exposed multiple times to multiple objects at multiple angles, the hologram will have multiple images that change when viewed at different angles."
