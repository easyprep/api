  "question": "What is / are the difference(s) between an Ecosystem and a Biome?<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>An ecosystem comprises biotic as well as abiotic components , while a biome has only biotic components</li>\r\n<li>An ecosystem is generally larger part of Biosphere, while a Biome is a smaller part.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is/ are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "<strong>Ecosystem versus Biome</strong> <em><u>Biomes are groups of ecosystems</u></em> that share similar conditions in an environment. The first thing we have to note that a Biome is a larger part that may comprise many ecosystems. Technically, Biomes are groups of ecosystems that share similar conditions in an environment. A biome is a large area with similar flora, fauna, and microorganisms. Most of us are familiar with the tropical rainforests, tundra in the arctic regions, and the evergreen trees in the coniferous forests. Each of these large communities contains species that are adapted to its varying conditions of water, temperature, and soil. For instance, polar bears thrive in the arctic while cactus plants have a thick skin to help preserve water in the hot desert. So, the typical characteristics of the Biomes are that they have:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Similar climatic conditions</li>\r\n<li>Same kind of abiotic and biotic factors spread over a large area creating a typical ecosystem over that area.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHowever, please note that a Biome as well as an ecosystem may have many species. In fact, the biomes are divided on the basis of factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needle leaf), plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna), and climate."
