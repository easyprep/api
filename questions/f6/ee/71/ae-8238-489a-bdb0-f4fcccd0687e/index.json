  "answer": "Nagari",
  "explanation": "Shivaji and his successors issued coins in Gold and Copper. The script used on the coins was Nagari. The coins bore the name Chhatrapati Shivaji on one side and Sri Raja Siva on the other. It is believed that the first lot of minting with 7 lakh coins were showered on Shivaji, which later were melted under Aurangzebâ€™s Government as a response of animosity. Some of the mints where the coins were issued at the time were Bagalkot, Mulher, Chandor, Kolaba, Sangli, Miraj, Panhala, Balwantnagar (Jhansi), Jalaun, Kalpi, Kunch, Balanagar Gadha (Gadha Mandla), Ravishnagar (Sagar)."
