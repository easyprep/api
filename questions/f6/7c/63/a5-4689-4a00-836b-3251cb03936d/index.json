  "option1": "West Bengal",
  "option2": "Madhya Pradesh",
  "option3": "Kerala",
  "option4": "Andhra Pradesh",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Andhra Pradesh",
  "explanation": "Andhra Pradesh has become the first Indian State to reserve 75% jobs for local youths in all private industries. The state assembly has recently passed the Andhra Pradesh Employment of Local Candidates in Industries/Factories Act of 2019, which reserves 75% jobs in industrial units, factories, joint ventures and projects set up under public-private partnership mode. According to the new law, if a company does not find the necessary skills in locals, then it will need to train them in association with the state government. In this way, no company will be able to hide behind the excuse of not finding skilled local labourers. The act will ensure the employment of youth in the state but at the same time, the state will have to ramp up the training centres in order to make them skillful."
