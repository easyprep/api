  "question": "Which of the following is correct about the coefficient of limiting friction between any two surfaces in contact?",
  "option1": "it is equal to twice the tangent of angle of friction",
  "option2": "it is equal to twice the sine of angle of friction",
  "option3": "it is equal to the tangent of angle of friction",
  "option4": "it is equal to the sine of angle of friction",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "it is equal to the tangent of angle of friction",
  "explanation": "The coefficient of limiting friction between any two surfaces in contact is equal to the tangent of angle of friction between them. u = tan Q where u = coefficient of limiting friction and Q = angle of friction"
