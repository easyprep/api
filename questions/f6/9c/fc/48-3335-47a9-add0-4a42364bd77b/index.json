  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Bioaccumulation is defined as the gradual accumulation of the substances, like pesticides or other chemicals, in an organism. It occurs when an organism absorbs a substance with faster rate than that at which the substance is lost by catabolism and excretion. Bio-concentration is the process through which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water due to the exposure to a waterborne chemical."
