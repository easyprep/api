  "option1": "The Gambia",
  "option2": "Gabon",
  "option3": "Ghana",
  "option4": "Guinea",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "The Gambia",
  "explanation": "Arch 22 is a commemorative arch on the road into Banjul in the Gambia. It was built in 1996 to mark the military coup d'etat of July 22, 1994, through which Yahya Jammeh and his Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council overthrew the democratically elected Gambian government. A statue of the \"unknown soldier\" can be seen near the base of the arch: the soldier has a rifle strapped to his back and carries a baby in one hand while signalling victory (making a V-sign) with the other. Arch 22 is depicted on the back of the 100-dalasis banknote, the official currency of the Gambia."
