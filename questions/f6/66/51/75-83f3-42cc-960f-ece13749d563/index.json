  "question": "Which country has officially shuttered its consulate in Jerusalem?",
  "option1": "Russia",
  "option2": "United States",
  "option3": "Japan",
  "option4": "China",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "United States",
  "explanation": "The United States has officially shuttered its consulate in Jerusalem & downgraded the status of its main diplomatic mission to the Palestinians by folding it into the U.S. Embassy to Israel. For decades, the consulate functioned as a de facto embassy to the Palestinians. Now, that outreach will be handled by a Palestinian affairs unit, under the command of the embassy. The symbolic shift hands authority over U.S. diplomatic channels with the West Bank and Gaza to Ambassador David Friedman, a longtime supporter and fundraiser for the West Bank settler movement and fierce critic of the Palestinian leadership. The downgrade is the latest in a string of divisive decisions by the Trump administration that have backed Israel and alienated the Palestinians, who say they have lost faith in the US administrationâ€™s role as a neutral arbiter in peace process."
