  "question": "With regards to newly discovered type of Aurora borealis, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It was created due to compression of the magnetosphere.</li>\r\n<li>Aurora borealis occurs in the north while Aurora australis occurs in the south.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe NASA scientists have discovered a new type of Aurora over a Norwegian island. It was formed due to compression of earth’s magnetosphere. The earth’s protective magnetic field had compressed towards the surface and resulted in formation of the lights.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nAurora borealis is also known as Northern Lights. It occurs in the northern hemisphere. The Aurora australis or Southern Lights occurs in the southern hemisphere. It occurs due to interaction of the earth’s magnetic field with the solar winds."
