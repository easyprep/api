  "question": "Which country has declared that Israeli settlements on West Bank  do not violate international laws?",
  "option1": "United Kingdom",
  "option2": "Russia",
  "option3": "United States",
  "option4": "France",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "United States",
  "explanation": "The United States has recently declared that Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land “West Bank “ donot violate international laws. The US declaration marks the rejection of a 2016 UN Security Council (UNSC) resolution that settlements on the West Bank are a “flagrant violation” of international law and the US legal position on the issue since 1978. It is also a rejection of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, which outlaws transfers of population by an occupying power, and a new rift with US allies in Europe and in the Islamic world."
