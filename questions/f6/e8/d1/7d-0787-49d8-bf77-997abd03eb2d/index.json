  "option5": "",
  "answer": "One",
  "explanation": "The Second Round Table Conference (RTC) held during September–December 1931 (7 September 1931 to 1 December 1931) was also attended by the Congress, after the Gandhi-Irwin Pact that ended the Salt Satyagraha. Gandhi was the sole official representative of Congress. During the Conference Gandhi contended that the Congress alone represented political India; that there should be no separate electorates or special safeguards for Muslims or other minorities; and that the Depressed classes, being part of Hindus, could not be treated as a “minority”. However, the other participants like the Muslim League and Dr BR Ambedkar dismissed Gandhi’s contention. At the end of the conference the British government undertook to produce a Communal Award for minority representation, with the provision that any free agreement between the parties could be substituted for the award. Gandhi returned after attending the Second RTC at London on 28 December 1931; and on that day, the CWC decided to resume the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM)."
