The National E-Mobility Programme has been introduced to improve the e-mobility ecosystem that comprises vehicle manufacturers, charging infrastructure companies, fleet operators, service providers, etc. Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) will implement the National E-Mobility Programme. EESL will procure electric vehicles in huge numbers. The electric vehicles will replace the existing petrol and diesel vehicles. India would save more than 5 crore litres of fuel annually through these e-vehicles. This would result in reduction of more than 5.6 lakh tonnes of annual CO2 emission. For an electric car, the per kilometer cost is only 85 paisa. Whereas, it is Rs 6.5 for normal cars. This will help to reduce petroleum imports.",
