  "question": "With reference to the Defence Acquisition Committee approving the indigenous development of tank ammunition, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The ammunition is of armour piercing variety.</li>\r\n<li>The ammunition is intended for indigenous Arjun tanks.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",

  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe ammunitions to be produced are of armour piercing fin stabilized variety. This is to enhance the enemy armour penetration capacity. These are to be fired from the main guns of the tanks. The DAC has allocated 2,000 crore INR for capital procurement. It is a part of ‘Make in India’ initiative.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThe ammunitions are to be developed for T-72 and T-90 tanks. These are tanks of Russian origin. The T-90 were procured by India because of its capacity to manufacture T-72 in the domestic territory and also because the production of the Arjun tanks were delayed."
