  "question": "The formation of brilliant colours in soap film is a consequence of which of the following phenomenon?",
  "option1": "Multiple refraction and interference",
  "option2": "multiple refraction and dispersion",
  "option3": "diffraction and dispersion",
  "option4": "polarisation and interference",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Multiple refraction and interference",
  "explanation": "The bright colors seen in an oil slick floating on water or in a sunlit soap bubble are caused by interference. The brightest colors are those that interfere constructively. These rays will interfere in a way that depends on the thickness of the film and the indices of refraction of the various media."
