  "question": "If place X and Place Y, both located on equator, are at a distance of 18520 kilometers, the approximate difference between their longitudes will be ____?",
  "option1": "100°",
  "option2": "120°",
  "option3": "166°",
  "option4": "180°",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "166°",
  "explanation": "We all know that a minute of arc on the planet Earth is 1 nautical mile. 1 nautical mile is 1852 meters or 1.852 kilometers. To travel around the Earth at the equator, we would have to travel (360 * 60) 21,600 nautical miles, 24,857 miles or 40,003 kilometers.<br />The question says that the distance between point X and Y is 18520 kilometers , which means that they are 10000 nautical miles apart. So, if 21620=360°, 10000=166.5°. So correct option is C"
