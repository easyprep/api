  "answer": "Uttarakhand",
  "explanation": "To reduce human-animal conflict, the Uttarakhand government has decided to carry out bio-fencing by growing various species of plants in those areas viz. lemongrass, agave, rambans, and chilly. The move is to prevent wild animals from entering residential areas and to protect agricultural crops and livestock in areas adjoining to forests. This biotic method is environment-friendly and harvesting of such plants can also be economical for farmers. Leopards, bears, elephants and wild boars are a major threat to human life and livestock."
