  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Type 1 diabetes, is also called juvenile diabetes because it develops most often in young people; however, type 1 diabetes can also develop in adults. Type 2 diabetes, which used to be called adult-onset diabetes, begins with insulin resistance—a condition that occurs when fat, muscle, and liver cells do not use insulin to carry glucose into the body’s cells to use for energy."
