It is the second-largest hot lake in the world located in Morne Trois Pitons National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, in the island of Dominica. It is a flood fumarole type lake located within the vicinity of a volcano which emits steam and gases escaping from molten magma below. As a result, this lake is filled with bubbling greyish-blue water that is usually enveloped in a cloud of vapour."
