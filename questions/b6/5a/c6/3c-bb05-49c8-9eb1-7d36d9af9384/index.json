  "question": "The Nilgiri Tahr population has increased by 27% in 3 years according to reports. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Spread of invasive plants causes reduction in the Tahr population.</li>\n<li>The Nilgiri Tahr is an endemic species.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe spread of invasive flora like Scotch Broom and Gorse in the hills affects the Tahr population. This is because such plants reduce the native plant population which is the food source for these herbivores. The curbing of the invasive floraâ€™s spread along with control of tourism and poaching has contributed to the current increase in population.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Nilgiri Tahr is an endemic animal of the Nilgiri Hills and the Southern part of Western Ghats. It is listed as an endangered animal by IUCN. Their habitat is open montane grasslands. The current reports reveal that the population has a healthy sex ratio implying that the population increase is sustainable."
