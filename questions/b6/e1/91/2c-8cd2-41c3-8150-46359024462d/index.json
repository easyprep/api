  "question": "The LCM of two numbers is 4 times their HCF. The sum of LCM and HCF is 125. If one of the number is 100, then the other number is :",
  "option1": 5,
  "option2": 25,
  "option3": 100,
  "option4": 125,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 25,
  "explanation": "Let LCM be L and HCF be H, then L = 4H (Given)\r\n$latex \\\\therefore H + 4H = 125$\r\n$latex => 5H = 125$\r\n$latex => H = 25$\r\n$latex \\\\therefore L = 4 \\\\times 25 = 100$\r\n$latex \\\\therefore Second\\\\ Number\\\\ = \\\\frac{L\\\\times H}{First Number}&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{100\\\\times 25}{100} = 25&s=1$\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer."
