  "option3": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3 Only",
  "explanation": "The Indus Valley or Harappan People domesticated animals like&nbsp;oxen, buffaloes, pigs, goats and&nbsp;sheep.&nbsp;Camels&nbsp;and asses were used as means of transport.&nbsp;Dogs&nbsp;and cats were kept as pets. The humped&nbsp;bull&nbsp;was considered a great asset in the farming community.&nbsp;Horse&nbsp;remains have been found at only one site i.e at Surkotada.So there is no clear evidence of Horse domestication by the Harappan people."
