  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "Surface currents constitute about 10 per cent of all the water in the ocean. These waters are the upper 400 m of the ocean.<br />Deep water currents make up the other 90 per cent of the ocean water. These waters move around the ocean basins due to variations in the density and gravity."
