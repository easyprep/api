  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "<p class=\\\"Explanation\\\">Arthashastra was intended as a guidebook for the king, to help him control both the people in his kingdom and the surrounding states. The Arthashastra’s fundamental assumption was that the king wanted to remain in power and should do whatever it took to retain it. Within the kingdom, Kautilya advocated a strict and authoritarian government aided by an extensive network of spies to gather intelligence and assess the popular mood. Although the Arthashastra was never the “Bible” of any ruling Indian dynasty, it detailed political philosophy and practices that existed in ancient and medieval India and can even be discerned in contemporary parliamentary politics."
