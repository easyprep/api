  "question": "During processing and cooking which part of food is mostly destroyed?",
  "option1": "Proteins",
  "option2": "Vitamins",
  "option3": "Carbohydrates",
  "option4": "Fats",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Vitamins",
  "explanation": "Higher temperatures, longer cooking time and larger quantities of water cause more nutrients to be lost. Water-soluble vitamins leach into cooking water, so vegetables lose greater quantities of vitamin C, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamins B-6 and B-12, niacin and folate."
