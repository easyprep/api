  "option1": "Photo-electric effect",
  "option2": "Fission reaction",
  "option3": "Fusion reaction",
  "option4": "Piezo-electric effect",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Piezo-electric effect",
  "explanation": "A flexible new material has been developed by researchers from Empa, the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, which generates electricity when stressed. The researchers have created a thin, flexible, rubbery material that generates electricity when stretched and compressed. This works using Piezo-electric effect.",
