  "explanation": "Indonesia is the country of origin of the traditional dance form \"Pendet dance\". Pendet dance is a traditional dance from Bali, Indonesia, in which floral offerings are made to purify the temple or theatre as a prelude to ceremonies or other dances. Pendet is typically performed by young girls, carrying bowls of flower petals, handfuls of which are cast into the air at various times in the dance. Pendet can be thought of as a dance of greeting, to welcome the audience and invite spirits to enjoy a performance. It is one of the oldest Balinese dance, although the current form was codified in the 1950s.",
