  "question": "A PIL (public interest litigation) by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Upadhyay has sought doing away with the law allowing candidates contesting more than one seat in elections in Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabhas. As per existing laws, on how many maximum seats an MP / MLA candidate is allowed to contest?",
  "option1": "Two",
  "option2": "Three",
  "option3": "Four",
  "option4": "Five",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Two",
  "explanation": "Under the existing legal regime, a candidate is allowed to contest from up to a maximum of two constituencies in Lok Sabha and Legislative Assembly polls. The PIL filed seeks to limit this to one seat because it leads to wastage of public money in getting the election conducted once again for the constituency which is left vacant by the winning candidate."
