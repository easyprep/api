  "question": "In context with the recent studies highlighting the effect of El Nino on the West Pacific Warm Pool, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is known as the ‘Heat Engine of the World’.</li>\n<li>It shows very high salinity throughout the year.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and  2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe West Pacific Warm Pool is also known as the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool. It is known as the Heat Engine of the World. This is because, the region is consistently warm (above 28 degree Celsius) throughout the year and it lies on the Great Ocean Conveyor Belt.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe salinity of the region varies across the year. Varying monsoon activity, location on the Great Ocean Conveyor Belt, tropical rains and cyclone contribute to varying and diluting the surface salinity of the region. It is also called the dilution basin."
