  "question": "Identify the boxing style. \"A boxer shifts back and forth between a right-handed (orthodox) stance and a left-handed (southpaw) stance on purpose to confuse their opponents in a fight\"?",
  "option1": "Switch-hitter",
  "option2": "Counterpuncher",
  "option3": "Slugger",
  "option4": "Swarmer",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Switch-hitter",
  "explanation": "A switch-hitter switches back and forth between a right-handed (orthodox) stance and a left-handed (southpaw) stance on purpose to confuse their opponents in a fight. Right-handed boxers would train in the left-handed (southpaw) stance, while southpaws would train in a right-handed (orthodox) stance, gaining the ability to switch back and forth after much training. A truly ambidextrous boxer can naturally fight in the switch-hitter style without as much training."
