  "question": "Which among the following methods is used in the nuclear power reactors to produce energy for peaceful purpose?",
  "option1": "Nuclear fusion",
  "option2": "Nuclear fission",
  "option3": "Radioactive decay",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Nuclear fission",
  "explanation": "Nuclear energy can be harnessed by two methods namely nuclear fusion and nuclear fission. Nuclear fission involves breaking of a large nucleus into two or more nuclei where as nuclear fusion is the process of fusing (merging) two lighter nuclei. Fusion reaction releases enormous amount of energy (under high temperature and pressure) and is uncontrollable and hence it is not preferred in nuclear reactors.Â <br />Note: Nuclear fusion powers Sun and all the stars.<br />Extra info: Hydrogen bomb uses the process of nuclear fusion and hence it is the most powerful bomb."
