  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe NDRF and SDRF are not meant for compensation of damage incurred to crop or property due to disasters. They are meant for immediate relief provision. When the funds from the SDRF becomes insufficient, the NDRF provides financial assistance for immediate relief provision.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe centre contributes 90% to the all the states’ disaster response funds. Initially, it contributed differentially to different categories of states’ disaster response funds. The centre contributed 75% of the funds for general category states and 90% of the funds for special category states, like the North-east states and hilly states."
