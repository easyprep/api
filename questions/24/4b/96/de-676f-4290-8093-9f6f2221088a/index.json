  "answer": "Mahatma Gandhi",
  "explanation": "The Cripps Mission was a failed attempt in late March 1942 by the British government. It aim was to secure full Indian cooperation and support for their efforts in World War II. Gandhi said that Cripps\\' offer of Dominion Status after the war was a \\\"post-dated cheque drawn on a failing bank\\\". The Congress stopped talks with Cripps and, guided by Gandhi, the national leadership demanded immediate self-government in return for war support."
