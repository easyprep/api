  "question": "With reference to Bhutan’s decision to impose the ‘sustainable development fee’ on tourists, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is not applicable to regional tourists from countries like India and Bangladesh.</li>\n<li>It is uniformly applicable throughout Bhutan.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Bhutan legislature recently passed the Tourism Levy and Exemption Bill of Bhutan 2020. This imposes the ‘sustainable development fees’ or SDF on regional tourists too. This fee is collected to protect the fragile Himalayan ecosystem of the country with heavy influx of tourists from India, Bangladesh and Maldives.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe SDF will not be uniformly applicable across the country. The SDF is not applicable to 11 districts in the eastern part of Bhutan which isn’t as popular with the tourists. This is to promote the tourism in the region. Children below the age of 5 years are exempt from the SDF."
