  "question": "The features found in Mangrove plants include: <br />1.Pneumatophores<br />2.Vivipary <br />3.Increased concentration of salts in cells<br />4.Sunken Stomata<br />Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option3": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "The features found in Mangrove plants are:<br />1. Pneumatophores are the aerial root specialized for gaseous exchange.<br />2. Vivipary is the condition whereby the embryo (the young plant within the seed) grows first to break through the seed coat then out of the fruit wall while still attached to the parent plant.<br />3. They have Increased concentration of salts in cells<br />4. A sunken stomata is a stomata in a small pit, which protects the escaping water vapor from air currents, decreasing water loss from the leaf."
