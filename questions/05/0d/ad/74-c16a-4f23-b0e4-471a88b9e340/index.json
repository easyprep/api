  "explanation": "Cleisthenes was an ancient Athenian lawgiver credited with reforming the constitution of ancient Athens and setting it on a democratic footing in 508 BC. For these accomplishments, historians refer to him as \"the father of Athenian democracy.\" He was also credited with increasing the power of the Athenian citizens' assembly and for reducing the power of the nobility over Athenian politics. Through Cleisthenes' reforms, the people of Athens endowed their city with isonomic institutions—equal rights for all citizens (though only men were citizens)—and established ostracism.",
