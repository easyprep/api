  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Wasteland Atlas was developed by National Sensing Centre. The 2019 edition of the atlas amps hitherto unmapped areas in the Jammu and Kashmir region. It gives both district and state-wise distribution of wastelands of different categories. It shows variations between the period of 2008-09 and 2015-16.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe wasteland areas under the dense scrub, marshy, sandy, waterlogged, gullied, ravinous, degraded pastures and grazing lands have reduced over the years. The waste lands have been converted into croplands, industrial areas, plantations, forest plantations, dense forests etc. several states like Rajasthan, MP, UP, AP, Mizoram, etc. have shown positive changes."
