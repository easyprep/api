  "question": "Which of the following represents the total momentum transferred to a surface by an electromagnetic wave?",
  "option1": "Total energy transferred/Speed of light",
  "option2": "Total energy transferred/ 2 x Speed of light",
  "option3": "2 x Total energy transferred/Speed of light",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Total energy transferred/Speed of light",
  "explanation": "If the total energy transferred to a surface in time t is U, then the magnitude of the total momentum delivered to this surface (for complete absorption) is U/c."
