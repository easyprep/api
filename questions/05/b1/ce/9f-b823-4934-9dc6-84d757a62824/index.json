  "answer": "Austria-Prussia Rivalry",
  "explanation": "The Silesian Wars, happened as part of the Austria–Prussia rivalry, were three wars fought in the mid-18th century between Prussia, under King Frederick the Great, and Austria, under Archduchess Maria Theresa, for control of the Central European region of Silesia (now in south-western Poland). The First (1740–1742) and Second (1744–1745) Silesian Wars formed parts of the wider War of the Austrian Succession, in which Prussia acted as one member of a coalition seeking territorial gain at Austria's expense. The Third Silesian War (1756–1763) was one theatre of the global Seven Years' War, in which Austria, in turn, led a coalition of powers aiming to seize Prussian territory. All three wars are generally considered to have ended in Prussian victories."
