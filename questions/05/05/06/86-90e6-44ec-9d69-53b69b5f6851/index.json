  "question": "In context of the recent efforts by scientists to conserve seagrass around the world, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Seagrass can also grow in freshwater.</li>\r\n<li>Seagrass is threatened by eutrophication.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nSeagrass is a type of flowering plant unique to marine environments around the world. They are photosynthetic in nature and possess long narrow leaves. They are usually found in shallow seas and sheltered coastal areas. They are known for hosting diverse marine species from fishes to molluscs.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nSeagrass is threatened by eutrophication. Eutrophication is the overgrowth of algae due to increase in concentration of nutrients in the water. These plantsâ€™ population has declined by about 80% since the 1990s. They cover less than 0.2% of the oceans but store twice as much carbon per given area than a tropical forest."
