  "question": "When Sulphur is heated with rubber, the process is commonly known as ?",
  "option1": "Galvanization",
  "option2": "Sulphonation",
  "option3": "Vulcanization",
  "option4": "Hydrodesulfurization",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Vulcanization",
  "explanation": "Natural rubber becomes soft at high temperature (&gt;335 K) and brittle at low temperatures (&lt;283 k) and shows high water absorption capacity. It is soluble in non-polar solvents and is non-resistant to attack by oxidising agents. To improve upon these physical properties, a process of vulcanisation is carried out. This process consists of heating a mixture of raw rubber with sulphur and an appropriate additive at a temperature range between 373 K to 415 K. On vulcanisation, sulphur forms cross links at the reactive sites of double bonds and thus the rubber gets stiffened.\r\nÂ In the manufacture of tyre rubber, 5% of sulphur is used as a crosslinking agent"
