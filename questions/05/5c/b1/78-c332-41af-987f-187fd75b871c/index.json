  "question": "In context of the reports of the success of London Congestion Charge, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Electric vehicles are exempted from the congestion charge.</li>\r\n<li>Toxicity charge is not collected in areas where congestion charge is collected.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe London congestion charge is a surcharge imposed in London on users of areas designated as congestion charge zone. These areas are subject to high congestion and the charge has helped curb traffic by 10%. Electric vehicles are exempted from this charge.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:   </strong>\r\nThe toxicity charge is imposed in addition to the congestion charge. It was introduced in 2017 and is also known as T charge. It is imposed on older automobiles that are more polluting and don’t meet the Euro 4 standards. Studies show that the scheme has helped reduce pollutant levels in 2020 compared to 2003."
