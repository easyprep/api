  "question": "Which of the following are the postulates of Darwin’s theory of evolution?",
  "option1": "Within any population, there is natural variation.",
  "option2": "Even though all species produce a large number of offsprings, populations remain fairly constant",
  "option3": "The struggle for survival within populations eliminates the unfit individuals.",
  "option4": "All the above are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All the above are correct",
  "explanation": "Darwin’s theory of evolution can be described as: within any population, there is natural variation. Some individuals have more favourable variations than others. Even though all species produce a large number of offsprings, populations remain fairly constant naturally. The struggle for survival within populations eliminates the unfit individuals. This is called natural selection."
