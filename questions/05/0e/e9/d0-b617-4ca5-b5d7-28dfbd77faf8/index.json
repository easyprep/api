  "explanation": "The Marrakesh Treaty facilitates Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled. India ratified the treaty on 30th June, 2014, thereby, becoming the first country to do so. The Refugee Convention 1951 governs how the nations should treat distressed people who are forced to leave their homes under harrowing conditions. India is neither a signatory to the convention nor its 1967 Protocol, which has 140 signatories. The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction or Hague Abduction Convention is a multilateral treaty developed by the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH). India is not a signatory to the Hague Convention."
