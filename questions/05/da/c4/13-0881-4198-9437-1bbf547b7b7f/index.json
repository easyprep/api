  "explanation": "Awash River and it's associated Lower Valley of the Awash is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the Afar region of Ethiopia. Awash River has an endorheic drainage basin that covers several regions of Ethiopia and drains into several lakes such as Lake Gargori, Lake Abbe, etc. The Awash Valley contains one of the most important groupings of paleontological sites on the African Continent. The remains found at the site, the oldest of which date back at least 4 million years, provide evidence of human evolution which has modified our conception of the history of humankind. The most spectacular discovery came in 1974 when 52 fragments of a skeleton of Australopithecus afarensis \"Lucy\" enabled reconstruction."
