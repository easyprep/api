  "question": "If a, b, c are three numbers such that a : b = 3 : 4 and b : c = 8 : 9, then a : c is equal to:",
  "option1": "1 : 2",
  "option2": "1 : 3",
  "option3": "2 : 3",
  "option4": "3 : 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 : 3",
  "explanation": "We can write a : c by compounding a : b and b : c\r\n$latex \\\\frac{a}{c} = \\\\frac{a}{b}\\\\times \\\\frac{b}{c}, \\\\frac{a}{c} = \\\\frac{3}{4}\\\\times \\\\frac{8}{9}, \\\\frac{a}{c} = \\\\frac{2}{3}&s=1$\r\n$latex => a : c  = 2 : 3$\r\nHence option [C] is the right answer."
