  "question": "If A and B together can complete a piece of work in 15 days and B alone in 20 days, then in how many days can A alone complete the work ?",
  "option1": "30 days",
  "option2": "40 days",
  "option3": "45 days",
  "option4": "60 days",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "60 days",
  "explanation": "(A + B)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{15}&s=1$\r\nB\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{20}&s=1$\r\n∴ A\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{15}-\\\\frac{1}{20} = \\\\frac{4-3}{60}= \\\\frac{1}{60}&s=1$\r\n∴ A alone will do the work in 60 days.\r\nHence option [D] is correct answer."
