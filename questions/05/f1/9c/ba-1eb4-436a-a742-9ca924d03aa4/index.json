  "question": "The HCF of two numbers is 15 and their LCM is 300. If one of the number is 60, the other is:",
  "option1": 75,
  "option2": 65,
  "option3": 50,
  "option4": 100,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 75,
  "explanation": "Because, First number $latex \\\\times$ Second number = LCM $latex \\\\times$ HCF\r\nâˆ´ Second Number = $latex \\\\frac{15\\\\times 300}{60}=75&s=1$\r\nHence option [A] is the right answer."
