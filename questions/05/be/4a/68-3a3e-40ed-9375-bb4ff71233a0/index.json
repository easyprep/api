  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Germany",
  "explanation": "Germany houses the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Water Management System of Augsburg\". The Water Management System of Augsburg is a sustainable system of water management that evolved in successive phases through the City’s application of innovative hydraulic engineering, demonstrating an exemplary use of water resources over the course of more than seven centuries. It represents an urban water landscape that is unparalleled in terms of its surviving successive technical diversity. It includes a network of canals, water towers dating from the 15th to 17th centuries, which housed pumping machinery, a water-cooled butchers’ hall, a system of three monumental fountains and hydroelectric power stations, which continue to provide sustainable energy today. The technological innovations generated by this water management system have helped establish Augsburg as a pioneer in hydraulic engineering."
