  "question": "Which of the following parliaments has become the first in the world to declare climate emergency?",
  "option1": "United Kingdom",
  "option2": "United States",
  "option3": "Japan",
  "option4": "Germany",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "United Kingdom",
  "explanation": "The United Kingdom Parliament has become the first national legislative body in the world to pass national declaration (or motion) of an Environment and climate emergency. The move comes a week after 16-year-old Swedish student Greta Thunberg addressed UK lawmakers to demand more climate action, and in the wake of protests by climate action group Extinction Rebellion, who blocked major landmarks in London. Thus, the symbolic move recognizes the urgency needed to combat the climate crisis. The move will increase pressure on the government and is demanding that the country takes action to help avoid more than 1.5 degrees centigrade of warming, requiring global emissions to be cut by almost half of 2010 levels by 2030.  It also calls for the government to work towards carbon neutrality before 2050 and for ministers to draft proposals within the next six months to restore the country\\'s environment and create a \\\"zero waste economy‚Äù."
