  "question": "River Ghaggar has been in news for the inundated and damaged crops adjoining it. In this context, which of the following statements are correct?\n<ol>\n<li>Ghaggar is a perennial river that passes through India and Pakistan.</li>\n<li>Ghaggar is an endorheic river.</li>\n<li>Markanda and Tangri are two tributaries of the river.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "All of the above",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 and 3",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 and 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nGhaggar is an intermittent river that passes through India and Pakistan. It flows only during the monsoon season. It has a Khadir and a Bhangar basin. The former is flooded during monsoon while the latter isn’t. It supported the Indus valley civilisation and its intermittent nature is one of the reasons for the downfall of the civilisation (reduction in monsoon).\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nGhaggar is an endorheic river- i.e., does not flow into an external body of water, like ocean, but converges into a swamp/ lake. This makes them closed hydrologic systems. It starts in Himachal Pradesh, flows through Haryana and Punjab, before terminating in Rajasthan. It is called ‘dead river’ in Rajasthan.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe tributaries of the river Markanda and Tangri flow in India. The danger level of the river is 748 feet- which has been breached several times in the past during floods- 1993, 1998 etc. the tributaries are not able to take in the excess water during floods. The excess water flow results from widespread rains in the catchment area, lack of protective embankment, narrow spots on course, hyacinth overgrowth etc."
