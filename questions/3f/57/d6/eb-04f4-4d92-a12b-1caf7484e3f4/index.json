  "answer": "Stouffer",
  "explanation": "Intervening Opportunities Model: - Stouffer introduced the concept of intervening opportunities in an attempt to improve upon Zipf's principle of least effort. According to him the actual distance between two places is less important a determinant of migration than the nature of space. He argued that distance should be considered in socio-economic rather than geometric terms."
