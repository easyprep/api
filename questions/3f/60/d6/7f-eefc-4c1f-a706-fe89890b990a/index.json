  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Siamraptor fossils were discovered in Thailand. They lived in the Thai floodplains more than 113 million years ago. The find has been described as the most complete fossil specimen found in its type and origin time. They were some of the apex predators of their time.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Siamraptors were not capable of flight. However, their skeletal system has many air sacs. Scientists say that this enables it to breathe faster and made its frame lightweight. It was fast and dynamic predator. The reptile is characterised by it shark-like teeth."
