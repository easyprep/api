  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Guyana and Venezuela",
  "explanation": "Guyana and Venezuela are the two countries that are involved in the \"Schomburgk Line\" territorial dispute. Under the aegis of the Royal Geographical Society, the German-born explorer and naturalist Robert Hermann Schomburgk conducted botanical and geographical exploration of British Guiana in 1835. This resulted in a sketch of the territory with a line marking what he believed to be the western boundary claimed by the Dutch. As a result of this, he was commissioned in 1840 by the British government to survey Guiana's boundaries. This survey resulted in what came to be known as the \"Schomburgk Line\". There was no official dispute between Guyana and Venezuela until the Line was created. Venezuela disputed Schomburgk's placing of border markers at the Orinoco river, and in 1844 claimed all of Guiana west of the Essequibo River.",
