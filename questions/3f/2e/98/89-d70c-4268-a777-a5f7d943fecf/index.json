  "explanation": "The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has successfully launched the world’s smallest rocket with the ability to put a tiny satellite into orbit. The experimental SS-520 sounding rocket lifted off from the Uchinoura Space Center. It carried a microsatellite TRICOM-1R, a three-unit CubeSat weighing about 3 kilograms. The CubeSat will now be used to collect images of the Earth\\'s surface via multiple cameras. This satellite launch was a re-flight of the TRICOM-1 mission, which was lost in SS-520’s failure in 2017."
