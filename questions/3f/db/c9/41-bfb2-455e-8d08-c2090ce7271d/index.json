  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 3",
  "option4": "None of them",

  "answer": "None of them",
  "explanation": "Khapli wheat is traditionally cultivated on a limited scale in Karnataka, southern Maharashtra, Saurashtra region of coastal Gujarat, parts of Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh. Second statement is incorrect because Khapli wheat forms only 1% of all wheat grown in India. Third statement is again incorrect because “Khapli” wheat is planted in spring and harvested in mid or late summer and is known as summer wheat."
