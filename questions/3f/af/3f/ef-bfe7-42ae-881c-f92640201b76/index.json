  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "India’s only orangutan, ‘Binny’,   has passed away at the age of 41 at Nandankanan Zoological Park in Odisha. The great ape was brought to the Odisha zoo in November 2003 from Pune\\'s Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park on November 20, 2003, when she was 25.  Orangutans are one of the world’s three extant species of great apes. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), there are three species of orangutans — Bornean, Sumatran and Tapanuli. Bornean and Sumatran orangutans differ a little in appearance and behaviour. All three kinds of orangutans are listed as “Critically Endangered” by the United Nations-affiliated International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). They are native to Indonesia and Malaysia and at present are found only in the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. The WWF states that orangutans, with distinctive red fur, are the largest arboreal mammal, spending most of their time in trees.They are considered to be among the most intelligent primates. They can live up to 45 years in the wild and even more in zoos."
