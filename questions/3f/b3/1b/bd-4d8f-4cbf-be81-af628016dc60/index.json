  "question": "Consider the following statements:<br />1. Anhydrous sodium carbonate is commonly known as baking soda.<br />2. Baking soda is used in fire extinguishers.<br />3. Bleaching powder is manufactured in Hasenclever plant.<br />Which of the statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1, 2 and 3",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "3 only",
  "option4": "1 and 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 and 3",
  "explanation": "• Anhydrous sodium carbonate is also known as calcined soda. It is formed by heating the hydrates. It is also formed when sodium hydrogen carbonate is heated (calcined).<br />• Baking soda, (sodium bicarbonate) is used in class C fire extinguishers. When sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) is heated by the fire it becomes sodium carbonate. During this process water and carbon dioxide is released.<br />• Hasenclever Plant: Dry slaked lime is moved forward by the revolving blades of the rotating shaft. In the meantime chlorine gas is passed through the lowermost cylinder which moves up to the upper cylinders and reacts with the dry slaked lime coming downward to form bleaching powder."
