  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are incorrect",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nWrit of habeas corpus is the only route for challenging a detention under the PSA. It literally means, ‘to produce the body of’. The government is required to produce the detained person. This writ is not applicable if the detention is by a competent court, is lawful, is for contempt of court/ legislature, etc.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nHigh Courts and Supreme Courts have the power to squash a government order to detain a person under this act. But the order-issuing authority/ official is not liable to prosecution / legal proceedings. The government can reissue a detention order even after squashing of the previous order.\n<strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe persons detained under this act do not get access to lawyers’ services nor bail provisions. Though article 22 of constitution provides the right to legal consultations, there is a provision for preventive detention of persons for the sake of public security and order.\n&nbsp;"
