The author tells the story of how he dealt with the Dhanbad coal mafia, how he changed the way the industry was perceived, how he dealt with the trade unions and the government and, most importantly, how he was able to script one of the greatest success stories the country had ever seen. In all, it\\'s the story of Coal India Ltd\\'s (CIL) transformation from a hugely loss-making enterprise since its formation in the 70s into a profitable Maharatna PSU. It must be noted that CIL contributes to around 82% of India\\'s coal production and is headquartered in Kolkata, West Bengal."
