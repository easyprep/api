  "question": "A and B travel the same distance at speed of 9 km/hr and 10 km/hr respectively. If A takes 36 minutes more than B, the distance travelled by each is :",
  "option1": "48 km",
  "option2": "54 km",
  "option3": "60 km",
  "option4": "66 km",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "54 km",
  "explanation": "Let the distance between A and B be x km, then \r\n$latex \\\\frac{x}{9} - \\\\frac{x}{10} = \\\\frac{36}{60} = \\\\frac{3}{5}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{x}{90} = \\\\frac{3}{5}&s=1$\r\n$latex => x = \\\\frac{3}{5}\\\\times 90 = 54 km.&s=1$\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer"
