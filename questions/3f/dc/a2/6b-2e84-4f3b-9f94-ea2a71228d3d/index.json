  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "The 7 limbs of state are Swamin (King), Amatya (Minister), Janapada (Territory), Durga (Fort), Kosa (Treasury), Bala (Army) and Mitra (allies). Please note that Janapada comprised territory as well as population. The Saptanga Thoery was from the Brahamnaical school of thought and it covers the 4 elements of modern definition of state viz. 1. Population, 2. Territory, 3. Government, 4. Sovereignty. The Mitra allies corresponds to recognition in modern sense."
