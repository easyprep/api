  "question": "What is the susceptibility of a diamagnetic material?",
  "option1": "positive and small",
  "option2": "positive and large",
  "option3": "negative",
  "option4": "None",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "negative",
  "explanation": "In terms of the susceptibility <span class=\\\"symbol\\\">χ </span>, a material is diamagnetic if  <span class=\\\"symbol\\\"> χ </span> is negative, para- if  <span class=\\\"symbol\\\">χ </span> is positive and= small, and ferro- if  <span class=\\\"symbol\\\">χ</span> is large and positive"
