  "question": "Consider the following invasive plants:<br> 1. Lantana<br> 2. Parthenium<br> 3. Eupatorium<br> Which among the above came to India along with foodgrains imported from America?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "<table width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"100%\">Woody shrub Lantana (Lantana camara) was introduced in India from South and Central America. Two other flowering shrubs—eupatorium (Chromolaena odorata) and parthenium (Parthenium hysterophorus) came to India along with foodgrains imported from America. These weeds are known for aggressively occupying the forest floor and are responsible for illnesses and deaths in cattle. The presence of these invasive weeds, particularly in the Western Ghats, also affects the food habits of the herbivores in the region— elephants, bison and deer, to name a few—who are forced to migrate to agricultural fields in search of food. This results in man-animal conflict. Eco lo &#8211; gists and wildlife management officials should either look at the option of mechanically uprooting these weeds or provide scientific solutions to arrest their growth to preserve the local flora and fauna of the Western Ghats.</td></tr></tbody></table>"
