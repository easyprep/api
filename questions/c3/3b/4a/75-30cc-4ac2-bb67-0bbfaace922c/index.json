  "question": "Now a days, a little pack of Silica Gel (granular beads of Silica made from Sodium Silicate) comes with many products to control humidity and avoid spoilage or degradation of some goods. Which among the following property of Silica gel makes it useful for that purpose?",
  "option1": "Silica gel molecules are hydrophilic with large surface area and so its molecules trap the moisture",
  "option2": "Silica gel is a Hygroscopic substance with large surface area so its molecules absorb the moisture.",
  "option3": "Silica gel molecules are with a portion that is charge-polarized and capable of hydrogen bonding, thus bonds with the water molecules",
  "option4": "The semi permeable pouch in which silica gel is placed absorbs the moisture which later reacts with water.",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Silica gel is a Hygroscopic substance with large surface area so its molecules absorb the moisture.",
  "explanation": ""
