The mountain range is adjacent to Russian Amur Oblast. It runs from the northwest to southeast. It separates the valleys of Nenjiang River and the Amur River.\r\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe Lesser Khingan Mountain crater is formed on cretaceous granite bedrock. The crater has a depth of 150m and a diameter of 1,850m. Scientists have discovered lacustrine deposits in this crater. This implies that the crater held a lake which disappeared about 10,000 years ago."
