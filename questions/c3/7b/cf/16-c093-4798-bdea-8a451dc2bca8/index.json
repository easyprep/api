  "explanation": "Quitsato Sundial is an important tourist attraction of Ecuador. It is a cultural tourist place located in Ecuador. This sundial is located exactly at the Equator. Because of the design of sundial, the shadow projected by the gnomon on the dial lines can indicate solstices, equinoxes and also months of the year with great precision. Cayambe Volcano, which can be seen behind the sundial, is the only place where the equator passes through glacier. Also, it is the highest point on the equator in the world. The main goal of the sundial is to share the crucial aspects of the astronomical knowledge of the prehispanic cultures of the region."
