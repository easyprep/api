  "explanation": "• Tobacco is a cash crop. Since the first colonist to the \\\"New World\\\" began exporting tobacco, it has been considered a lucrative crop. Its cultivation has expanded throughout the world; its use in cigars, cigarettes, and pipes has become universal.<br />• Coconut is the only crop that has not failed the farmers so far. In fact, even the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University refers to coconut as a plantation crop under horticulture.<br />• A sugarcane crop is sensitive to the climate, soil type, irrigation, fertilizers, insects, disease control, varieties, and the harvest period. Sugarcane is a cash crop, but it is also used as livestock fodder."
