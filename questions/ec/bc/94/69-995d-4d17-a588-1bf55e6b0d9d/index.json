  "question": "If we look at the floating piece of iceberg on the sea, approximately what fraction of it is visible above the seawater level?",
  "option1": "1/8th",
  "option2": "1/6th",
  "option3": "1/10th",
  "option4": "1/5th",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1/8th",
  "explanation": "Approximately 1/8 (12.5 %) of the ice is visible above water and 7/8 (87.5 %) of the ice is submerged below the surface. This is because ice and snow are less dense than water. Here we must note that if the iceberg is made up of only compact ice, its visible part may be even 1/10th part because the compact part is relatively denser. But the top of the iceberg is usually made up of snow which is not that much compact and that is why the correct answer of this question is 1/8th."
