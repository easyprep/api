  "explanation": "Recently, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister has approved the proposal of Department of School Education &amp; Literacy to formulate an Integrated Scheme on School Education. The new scheme will subsume the ongoing schemes Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). It will commence from 1st April 2018 to 31st March 2020. It has come in the backdrop of PMâ€™s vision of SabkoShiksha, AchhiShiksha. It aims to support the States in universalizing access to school education from classes pre-nursery to XII across the country and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education from nursery to senior secondary stage in accordance with the Sustainable Development Goal for Education. Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS), launched by the HRD Ministry in 2013 with an aim of providing strategic funding to eligible state higher educational institutions. It is not included under the new Integrated Scheme for School Education."
