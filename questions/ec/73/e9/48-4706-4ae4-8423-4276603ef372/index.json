  "question": "Which of the following represents the cell potential?",
  "option1": "sum of the electrode potentials of the cathode and anode",
  "option2": "difference between the electrode potentials of the cathode and anode",
  "option3": "half of the sum of the electrode potentials of the cathode and anode",
  "option4": "twice the difference between the electrode potentials of the cathode and anode",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "difference between the electrode potentials of the cathode and anode",
  "explanation": "The cell potential is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction potentials) of the cathode and anode. It is measured in volts."
