  "question": "The impacts of Climate Change on Indian Agriculture can be mitigated by _? <br> 1. Crop Diversification<br> 2. Crop Insurance<br> 3. Crop Rotation<br> 4. Dryland Agriculture<br> Select the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option2": "Only 2, 3 & 4",
  "option3": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "Indian agriculture, with two-third rainfed area remains vulnerable to various vagaries of monsoon, besides facing occurrence of drought and flood in many  parts of the country. Natural calamities such as drought and flood occur frequently in many parts of the country. Climate change will aggravate these  risks and may considerably affect food security through direct and indirect effects on crops, soils, livestock, fisheries, and pests. Building climate  resilience, therefore, is critical. Potential adaptation strategies to deal with the adverse impacts of climate change are developing cultivars tolerant to heat, moisture, and salinity stresses; modifying crop management practices; improving water management; adopting new farm practices such as resource-conserving technologies; crop diversification; improving pest management; making available timely weather-based advisories; crop insurance; and harnessing the indigenous technical knowledge of farmers.<br>"
