  "question": "Once a lion has finished its meal, a vulture swoops down and finishes off the carcass. Which among the following term most appropriately denotes the relation between lion and vulture?",
  "option1": "Mutualism",
  "option2": "Symbiosis",
  "option3": "Commensalism",
  "option4": "Antibiosis",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Commensalism",
  "explanation": "Many orchids use trees as a surface to grow. In ecology, commensalism is a class of relationships between two organisms where one organism benefits from the other without affecting it. This is in contrast with mutualism, in which both organisms benefit from each other, amensalism, where one is harmed while the other is unaffected, and parasitism, where one benefits while the other is harmed."
