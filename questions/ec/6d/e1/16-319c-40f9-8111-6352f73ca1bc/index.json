  "option1": "Propyl alcohol",
  "option2": "Ethanol",

  "answer": "Ethylene glycol",
  "explanation": "Ethylene glycol is a chemical commonly used in many commercial and industrial applications including antifreeze and coolant. Ethylene glycol helps keep your car\\'s engine from freezing in the winter and acts as a coolant to reduce overheating in the summer. Ethylene glycol (antifreeze) is used in the cooling of a car radiator during the winter because it has a much lower freezing point than water. Its role in an automobile is to absorb heat from the engine."
