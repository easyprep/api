  "question": "Which of the following pollutants are responsible for Acid Rain?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Oxides of Nitrogen</li>\r\n<li>Oxides of Sulphur</li>\r\n<li>Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "2 and 3 Only",
  "option2": "1 and 2 Only",
  "option3": "1 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 2 Only",
  "explanation": "Acid rain is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids. When humans burn fossil fuels, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) (Combination of NO and NO<sub>2)</sub> are released into the atmosphere. These chemical gases react with water, oxygen, and other substances to form mild solutions of sulfuric and nitric acid. NOx are formed in atmosphere due to lightning strikes in tropics and subtropics level at a height of 3-5 km from earth surface. NOx are also released by aircrafts in stratosphere."
