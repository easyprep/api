  "option5": "",
  "answer": "North-East Monsoons",
  "explanation": "During winter, the North-east dry Monsoon winds blow over the Bay of Bengal. As they pass over the Bay of Bengal they pick up moisture and bring rain to the Tamil Nadu coast as now they are under the effect of on-shore winds, full of moisture and Chennai receives rainfall more in winter than in summer."
