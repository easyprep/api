  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option4": "1,2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Delimitation is the process by which the boundaries of electoral constituencies, whether for the Lok Sabha, state assemblies or even local bodies, are periodically redrawn. A democracy ideally operates on a one-man-one-vote principle. However, since the voter in India directly elects only the MP or the MLA representing his or her constituency, for this principle to be translated into practice, constituencies must have roughly equal populations. Otherwise, each voter in a smaller sized constituency would have a greater voice than one in a larger constituency."
