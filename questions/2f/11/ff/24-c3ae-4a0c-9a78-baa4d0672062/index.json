  "question": "Which two countries share the location of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"High Coast/Kvarken Archipelago\"?",
  "option1": "Brazil and Argentina",
  "option2": "Portugal and Spain",
  "option3": "Russia and Ukraine",
  "option4": "Finland and Sweden",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Finland and Sweden",
  "explanation": "The High Coast in Sweden and the Kvarken Archipelago in Finland are situated on opposite sides of the Gulf of Bothnia, in the northern part of the Baltic Sea. This vast area is where high meets low: the High Coast’s hilly scenery with high islands, steep shores, smooth cliffs, and deep inlets is a complete contrast to the Kvarken Archipelago with its thousands of low?lying islands, shallow bays, moraine ridges and massive boulder fields. This part of the world has experienced several Ice Ages during the last 2?3 million years and has been under the centre of the continental ice sheet a number of times. Present land uplift started when the ice began to melt about 18,000 years ago and the earth’s crust was gradually released from the weight of the ice. The site affords outstanding opportunities for the understanding of the important processes that formed the glaciated and land uplift areas of the Earth''s surface."
