  "question": "Argon is the third most common gas in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, at 0.93%. This gas is generated due to decay of which among the following isotopes in the Earth&#8217;s crust ?",
  "option1": "K-40",
  "option2": "Ca-40",
  "option3": "Ca-48",
  "option4": "K-41",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "K-40",
  "explanation": "Potassium-40, which is a rare radioactive isotope of potassium has a very long half life. It undergoes all three types of beta decay (ß-, ß+ and electron capture). About 89% of the time 40K decays to calcium-40 (40Ca). However, 11% of the time it decays to argon-40 (40Ar)."
