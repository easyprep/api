  "question": "A man rows upstream 36 km and downstream 48 km taking 6 hrs each time. The speed of the current is :",
  "option1": "0.5 km/hr",
  "option2": "1 km/hr",
  "option3": "1.5 km/hr",
  "option4": "2 km/hr",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 km/hr",
  "explanation": "Rate downstream of boat $latex = \\\\frac{48}{6}  = 8\\\\:km/hr&s=1$\r\nRate upstream $latex = \\\\frac{36}{6}  = 6\\\\:km/hr&s=1$\r\nâˆ´ Speed of current $latex = \\\\frac{1}{2}(Rate\\\\: downstream - Rate\\\\: upstream)&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{1}{2}(8-6)=1&s=1\\\\:km/hr$\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer."
