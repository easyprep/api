  "explanation": "• Japan is called the land of rising sun because the country was so close to where the sun rises. For the last 1400 years or so, the world has referred to Japan as Nippon, the land of the rising sun.<br />• Even though there are numerous nations in the Arctic Circle which experience the midnight sun, Norway is the only one known as the land of the midnight sun.<br />• Finland is called \\'\\'the land of a thousand lakes,\\'\\' but at last count there were 187,888 of them. Finland has one lake for every 26 people.<br />• Bhutan is called Land of Thunder Dragon because of the violent and large thunderstorms that whip down through the valleys from the Himalayas, Bhutan is known as the Land of Thunderbolt. The sparkling light of thunderbolts was believed to be red fire of a dragon."
