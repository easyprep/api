  "option3": "2 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 & 3 Only",
  "explanation": "Disinvestment implies sale of substantial portion of government’s share holding in a central public sector enterprise to private entities. Strategic disinvestment is the sale of substantial portion of government’s shareholding in identified CPSEs upto 50 per cent or more, along with transfer of management control. Currently, NITI Aayog is vested with task to identify CPSEs for strategic disinvestment and advice on the mode of sale, percentage of shares to be sold of the CPSE and method for valuation of the CPSE. Disinvestment helps government to raise funds in order to meet its budgetary needs. In other words, it is aimed at reducing the financial burden on the government due to inefficient PSUs and to improve public finances.The rationale behind strategic disinvestment is privatisation as it is believed that private ownership leads to better use of resources and their more efficient allocation. It hardly has anything to do with inflation."
