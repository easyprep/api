  "option5": "",
  "answer": "West European type",
  "explanation": "West European type of climate (Cb) also known as marine west coast climate is located between 40° and 65° latitudes in both the hemispheres along the western coasts of the continents. This climatic region is sur¬rounded by Mediterranean climate in the south, conti¬nental dry climate in the east and semi-arctic climate in the north. The inland extension of this climate is controlled by topographic features.<br />The temperatures, in the west European climate are affected by marine influences, warm ocean cur¬rents and prevailing winds and air masses. In fact, the moderating effects of sea bring down the difference between summer and winter seasons considerably. This climate is characterized by cool summer and mild winters. Average temperature during summer season ranges between 15°C and 21°C.\r\n&nbsp;"
