  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "Neap Tides: The sun and the moon become at a right angle to each other with respect to the earth. <br />Thus, the gravitational forces of the sun and the moon tend to counteract one another. <br />The tides during this period will be lower than the normal which are called as the neap tides. <br />They also occur twice in a month- during the first quarter moon and the last quarter moon."
