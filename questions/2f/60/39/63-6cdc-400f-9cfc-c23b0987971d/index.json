  "question": "Which among the following pairs is/are correctly matched?<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Stationary Front - formed when two contrasting air masses converge in such a way that they become parallel to each other and there is no ascent of air.</li>\r\n<li>Occluded Front - formed when cold front over­takes warm front and warm air is completely displaced from the ground surface.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct code from the options given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Occluded front is the front which is formed when cold front over­takes warm front and warm air is completely displaced from the ground surface.<br />Stationary front is formed when two contrasting air masses converge in such a way that they become parallel to each other and there is no ascent of air. The surface position of stationary front does not move either forward or backward."
