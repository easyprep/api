  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "Bones of many adult birds are hollow and are connected to a system of air sacs dispersed through the body. Bone or osseous tissue consists of phosphate and carbonate of lime, salt and a few other substances. They are not filled with marrow and contain more calcium than mammalian bone, which tends to make them more brittle and prone to developing multiple fractures"
