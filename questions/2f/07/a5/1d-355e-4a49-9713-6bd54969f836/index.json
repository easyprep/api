  "question": "With respect to the recent discussions about the Uttara Kannada artificial sand dune project, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is to prevent encroachment of beaches.</li>\n<li>It is to be built using river sand.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Karnataka government has planned a project of building artificial sand dunes along the beaches in Uttara Kannada district. The project is aimed at curbing encroachment of beaches and also to protect the beaches from rising sea levels, floods, erosions, etc. The project is also expected to develop wider beaches for recreational purposes.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe artificial dunes are to be built using reserve sand from the beach areas itself. These 3 to 4m high dunes are to be developed on a 20km shoreline. The area will also be fortified with vegetation like palm trees and vetiver plants. An earlier project in Maharashtra’s Bhatye beach made use of sand from nearby rivulets."
