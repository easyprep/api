  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe principle of ‘presumption of constitutionality’ was recently discussed in light of pleas for declaring the Citizenship Amendment Act as constitutional. The principle is used for statutory interpretations. It is used for interpretation of a law passed by legislature such as the Parliament.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe principle of presumption of constitutionality is used by the courts for interpreting the laws passed by legislature. The judiciary’s role is to look into the validity of a legislation and it does not declare a law constitutional as there is a presumption of constitutionality."
