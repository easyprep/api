  "explanation": "According to the World Health Organisation, diabetes is a growing challenge in India with an estimated 8.7% diabetic population in the age group of 20 and 70 years. The rising prevalence of diabetes and other non-communicable diseases is driven by a combination of factors such as rapid urbanisation, sedentary lifestyles, unhealthy diets, tobacco use, and increasing life expectancy. “India currently represents 49% of the world’s diabetes burden, with an estimated 72 million cases in 2017, a figure expected to almost double to 134 million by 2025. The prevalence of diabetes has increased by 64% across India over the quarter-century,” according to a report published in November 2017 by the Indian Council of Medical Research, and conducted with other organisations.
