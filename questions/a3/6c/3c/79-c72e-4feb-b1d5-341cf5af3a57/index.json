  "question": "With reference to the recent problems surrounding the Talcher coalfields, consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>Talcher coalfields are located in Jharkhand.</li>\n<li>These coalfields hold the highest quality coals in India according to GSI.</li>\n<li>Most of the coal in India is of the Anthracite type.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 and 3",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 and 2",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "None of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nTalcher coalfield is found in Odisha state. Jharkhand has the highest coal reserves in India. The Geological Survey of India approximates 51 billion tonnes of coal in Talcher- making it one of the largest reserve in India. The coal mined here is taken to power stations in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Andhra Pradesh and also for use in Odisha itself.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe coal here is mostly bituminous and other lower quality types. It has 25% ash content, 35% fixed carbon and 70% volatile matter. Bituminous coal is a medium grade coal and the type most commonly used for electricity production. It is also found in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, West Bengal, etc.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nAnthracite is the highest quality of coal. It has a high percentage of fixed carbon. It is found very minimally in India. Anthracite deposits occur in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The state also has the lowest grade of coal called Lignite. Other Lignite holding states are TN and Rajasthan."
