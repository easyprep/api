  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe protecting power is an instrument used to protect the interest of a country in another country where it does not have diplomatic presence. This is done with the help of a third country’s embassy that is acceptable to the receiving states. This instrument is provided for by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961 and 1963).\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\r\nThe protecting power of USA in Iran is Switzerland. The Swiss embassy in Tehran has been protecting US interests in Iran since 1980. It provides consular services to American citizens in Iran. Similarly, Iran is represented by Pakistan embassy in Washington, USA."
