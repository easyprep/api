  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Boxing",
  "explanation": "Joe Louis vs. Max Schmeling refers to two separate fights between the two which are among boxing's most talked about bouts. Schmeling took the first match by a knockout in round 12 but in the second match, Louis won with a knockout in the first round. Although these champions met to create a pugilistic spectacle remarkable on its own terms, the two fights came to embody the broader political and social conflict of the time. As the most significant African American athlete of his age and the most successful black fighter since Jack Johnson, Louis was a focal point for African American pride in the 1930s. Moreover, as a contest between representatives of the United States and Nazi Germany during the 1930s, the fights came to symbolize the struggle between democracy and nazism. Louis' performance in the bouts made him one of the first true African-American national heroes in the United States."
