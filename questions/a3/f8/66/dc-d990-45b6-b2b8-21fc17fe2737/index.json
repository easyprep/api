  "answer": "Wrestling",
  "explanation": "Indian wrestler Rahul Aware has won a bronze in men\\'s 61Kg free-style category at the 2019 World Championship in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan. However, this was not an Olympic category and thus the bronze did not help Aware qualify for the Tokyo Games. It was India’s fifth medal at this edition of the World Championships with a total haul of 1 silver and 4 bronzes. In the ongoing event, Deepak Punia  in men\\'s 86kg category was forced to pull out of the final due to an injury and settled for silver."
