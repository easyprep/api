  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Kikuyu people are an ethnic group in Kenya. The term ‘Kikuyu’ means ‘large sycamore tree’. The group was being discussed in light of the proposed digital identification system by the government. The impact of dominance of the Kikuyus in the government is being debated with reference to the proposed NIIMS.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe Kikuyu is the largest ethnic group in Kenya. They number 7 million people and constitute 20% of the population. More than 70 distinct ethnic groups live in Kenya with the smaller groups like El Molo having just 500 members."
