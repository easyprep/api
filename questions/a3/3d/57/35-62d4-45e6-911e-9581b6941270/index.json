  "question": "The government has recently unveiled an initiative called SATAT (Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation) to promote CBG (Compressed BioGas) as alternative fuel. Consider the following statements with respect to CBG (Compressed BioGas):\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>CBG can be naturally produced and does not need mining</li>\r\n<li>Most of the content of CBG is methane</li>\r\n<li>One of the main challenges of CBG is that it has substantially less calorific value than CNG (Compressed Natural Gas)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich of the above is / are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1& 2",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1& 2",
  "explanation": "Bio-gas can be naturally produced through the process of anaerobic decomposition from waste / bio-mass sources like agriculture residue, cattle dung, sugarcane press mud, municipal solid waste, sewage treatment plant waste. After purification, it is compressed and called CBG, which has pure methane content of over 95 percent, and is exactly similar to the commercially available natural gas in its composition and energy potential. With calorific value (~52,000 KJ/kg) and other properties similar to CNG, CBG can be used as an alternative, renewable automotive fuel. It says that given the abundance of biomass in the country, CBG has the potential to replace CNG in automotive, industrial and commercial uses in the coming years."
