  "explanation": "The biggest festival of Nepal  - Bada Dashain – has begun at famous Hanumandhoka Dashain Ghar in Kathamndu with Vedic rituals. The 15-day festival starts on first day of Navaratri with Ghatsthapana (traditional urn). Devotees performed Ghatsthapana and sowed maize and barley seeds for germination of the auspicious Jamara (barley shoots) in various parts of the country today.  During Dashain, people worship goddess Durga for nine days. On tenth day of festival, elders give golden barley shoots and put Tika on the forehead of younger members of the family and bless them for peace, progress and prosperity in the life."
