  "answer": "pH scale measure the hydrogen ion concentration",
  "explanation": "pH scale is a scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called pH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German, meaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). The pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale represent an acidic solution."
