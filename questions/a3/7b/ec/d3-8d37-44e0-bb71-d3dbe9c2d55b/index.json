  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Both the statements are correct in this question. The most significant feature of the land revenue system as introduced by Sher Shah was the elimination of tbe intermediaries, zamindars, agents or contractors for the purpose of collection of the land revenue. Instead, his government had established direct contacts with the ryots or cultivator, and had thus saved both the panics from being exploited by the middlemen. That is why his land revenue system has been called the Ryowari System or ‘system of the cultivators or ryots’. It is important to remember, however, that Sher Shah could not introduce this uniform land revenue system throughout his dominions. The iqtas of Multan, Malwa, Rajputana and a large number of feudatory states did not benefit from his reforms."
