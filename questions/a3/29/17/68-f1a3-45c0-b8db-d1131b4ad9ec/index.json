  "explanation": "The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme was introduced in 1998-99, as a innovative credit delivery system aiming at adequate and timely credit support from the banking system to the farmers for their cultivation needs including purchase of inputs in a flexible, convenient and cost effective manner. The Scheme is being implemented by all the District Central Cooperative Banks, Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) and Public Sector Commercial Banks throughout the country. KCC is one of the most effective tools for delivering agriculture credit. Banks have been advised to issue Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) to all eligible farmers. A new scheme for KCC has been circulated by RBI and NABARD which provides for KCC as an ATM card which can be used at ATM/Point of sale (POS) terminals. As on 31st March 2014, 111 lakh KCCs issued by Public Sector Banks were eligible for conversion into ATM cards, out of which 64.61 lakh eligible KCCs have since been converted into ATM enabled KCC cards."
