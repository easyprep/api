  "option5": "",
  "answer": 2023,
  "explanation": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has partnered with the International Food and Beverage Alliance (IFBA) to achieve its  target  under REPLACE initiative of eliminating industrial trans-fat from industrially produced global food supply by 2023. Trans-fat is also called the worst form of fat in food. It is responsible for over 5,00,000 deaths from coronary heart disease each year globally. Industrially-produced trans-fats are contained in hardened vegetable fats, such as margarine and ghee, and are often present in snack food, baked foods, and fried foods. Manufacturers often use them as they have a longer shelf life than other fats. But healthier alternatives can be used that would not affect taste or cost of food."
