  "answer": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong><em>A constitutional amendment bill must secure a majority of the total membership of the House and a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting, in each House of Parliament</em></strong>\r\nThis is a correct statement. A bill seeking to amend the Constitution (Under Article 368) needs:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a majority of the total membership of the House</li>\r\n<li>a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting, in each House of Parliament.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFurther, in some special cases i.e. amendments that affect the functioning of State governments, High Courts or the Supreme Court for example, also require the ratification of half the State legislatures in the country.\r\n<strong>Maximum numbers of constitutional amendments were passed during the Indira Gandhi regime</strong>\r\nThis is also a correct statement.  The Indira Gandhi’s government from 1971 to 1977, which included the Emergency years, passed 19 Constitutional amendments. This number is so far highest. The next highest number was under the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government (14)."
