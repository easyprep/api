  "question": "In recent times, the Wildlife and zoo managers have focussed on conserving endangered species such as Nilgiris Tahr, Nilgiris Langur and Lion Tailed Macaques (LTMs), which are on the verge of becoming extinct. What is / are advantages of the Captive Breeding Programme?<br> 1.It eliminated the need to preserve critical habitats.<br> 2.It is comparatively easy for highly mobile species such as migratory birds<br> 3.It can be used to enhance the genetic diversity<br> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "Captive breeding is the process of breeding animals in human controlled environments with restricted settings, such as wildlife reserves, zoos and other conservation facilities; sometimes the process is construed to include release of individual organisms to the wild, when there is sufficient natural habitat to support new individuals or when the threat to the species in the wild is lessened. Captive breeding programs facilitate biodiversity and may save species from extinction. However, such programs may also reduce genetic diversity and species fitness. Captive breeding techniques are usually difficult to implement for highly mobile species like some migratory birds (e.g. cranes) and fishes (e.g. Hilsa). Species like large cetaceans (whales, dolphins, etc.) may also have some difficulties as it would be hard to meet their biological requirements in captivity, especially the vast amount of space required to keep large populations."
