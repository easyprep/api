  "question": "In context with the discussions in the Supreme Court to interpret the law on land acquisition, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The Land Acquisition Law replaced the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act.</li>\n<li>When a judgement is declared incuriam, it becomes a precedent.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Land Acquisition Act is a colonial era act that was passed in 1894. This was replaced by the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act which was passed in 2013. The section 24 of this act had been discussed in the court.\n <strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nWhen a judgement is declared incuriam, the directive will not become a precedent. The judgement becomes legally invalid. The word incuriam is derived from Latin ‘incuria’ which means carelessness. This means that such a case was wrongly decided by the judges."
