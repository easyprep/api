  "explanation": "‘Ecology is defined as the scientific study of the relationship of living organisms with each other and with their environment.’ It has been derived from two Greek words, ‘oikos’, meaning home or estate and ‘logos’ meaning study. Ecology not only deals with the study of the relationship of individual organisms with their environment, but also with the study of populations, communities, ecosystems, biomes, and biosphere as a whole."
