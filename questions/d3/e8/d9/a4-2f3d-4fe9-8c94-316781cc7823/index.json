  "question": "A and B can do a piece of work in 36 days, B and C can do a it in 60 days, A and C can do it in 45 days. C alone can do it in :",
  "option1": "90 days",
  "option2": "120 days",
  "option3": "150 days",
  "option4": "180 days",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "180 days",
  "explanation": "(A + B)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{36}&s=1$\r\n(B + C)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{60}&s=1$\r\n(C + A)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{45}&s=1$\r\nOn adding, \r\n2(A + B + C)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{36}+\\\\frac{1}{60}+\\\\frac{1}{45} = \\\\frac{5+3+4}{180} = \\\\frac{1}{15}&s=1$\r\n∴ (A + B + C)\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{30}&s=1$\r\n∴ c\\'s 1 day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{30}-\\\\frac{1}{36} = \\\\frac{6-5}{180} = \\\\frac{1}{180}&s=1$\r\n∴ C alone will complete the work in 180 days. \r\nHence option [D] is correct answer."
