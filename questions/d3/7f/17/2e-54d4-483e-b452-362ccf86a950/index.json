  "question": "In how many years will a sum of money 800 Rs. at 10% per annum compound interest, compounded semi annually becomes 926.10 Rs.?",
  "option1": "$latex 1\\frac{2}{3}\\ years&s=1$",
  "option2": "$latex 1\\frac{1}{2}\\ years&s=1$",
  "option3": "$latex 2\\frac{1}{3}\\ years&s=1$",
  "option4": "$latex 2\\frac{1}{2}\\ years&s=1$",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "$latex 1\\frac{1}{2}\\ years&s=1$",
  "explanation": "Rate = 10% per annum = 5% half yearly\r\n$latex \\\\because A = P(1 + \\\\frac{R}{100})^{T}&s=1$\r\n$latex => 926.10 = 800 (1 + \\\\frac{5}{100})^{T}&s=1$\r\n$latex => \\\\frac{9261}{8000} = (\\\\frac{21}{20})^{T}&s=1$\r\n$latex => (\\\\frac{21}{20})^{3} = (\\\\frac{21}{20})^{T}&s=1$\r\n$latex \\\\therefore Time = 3\\\\ half\\\\ years = 1\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ years&s=1$\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer"
