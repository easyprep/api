It flows through Nepal and Bihar in India. It merges with the Ganga. It’s called the “Sorrow of Bihar” because of its annual flooding. It has many projects like the SaptaKoshi Multipurpose Project for hydroelectricity, Koshi embankment system, etc.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nMechi River is an international river. It originates in Nepal’s Mahabharat Range and flows through Bihar to join River Mahananda. The linking project will be the second after the Ken-Betwa project of MP. Its objectives are flood alleviation and irrigation.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe project is expected to benefit the Seemanchal region of Bihar. It will irrigate more than 2 lakh hectares of land and may bring about a green revolution in the region. Given its high coverage, it has the criteria for declaration as a ‘national project’. The project will transfer water from Kosi to Mahananda during annual floods."
