  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Drain of Wealth Theory was given by Dadabhai Naoroji in 1867. According to this theory, the poverty in India was due to external factors rather than internal factors. His theory was later taken forward by others like R C Dutt.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:        </strong>\nThe theory lists six external factors causing drain of Indian wealth. The use of the Indian wealth by the colonialists to fund their civil administration and army operations was one of the reasons. Other factors include external rule, opening up the country to free trade at the cost of natives’ economy, etc."
