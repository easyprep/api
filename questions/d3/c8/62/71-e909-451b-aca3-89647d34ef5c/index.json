  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 only",
  "explanation": "Statement 1 is not correct: US government granted India the status of STA-1 a trading partner equivalent to its closest allies in the NATO. India is now 37th in the list of countries getting this STA-1 status, conferred by USA and 3rd Asian country after Japan and South Korea. Statement 2 is correct: This decision will boost India-US defense trade &amp; will make it easy for India now to get high-technology product, particularly in civil space and defence sectors."
