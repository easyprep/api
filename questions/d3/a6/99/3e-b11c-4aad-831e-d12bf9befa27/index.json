  "question": "Perumal Murugan, who has authored the novel \"Kazhimugam\", is the noted poet of which language?",
  "option1": "Telugu",
  "option2": "Malayalam",
  "option3": "Tamil",
  "option4": "Odia",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Tamil",
  "explanation": "Perumal Murugan, the noted Tamil poet and author, has authored the novel \\'Kazhimugam\\', which deals with effect of modern gadgets on life of middle class. He is known for his controversial novel \\'Madhurobhagan (translated as \\'One Part Woman\\')\\', which narrates the story of a childless couple \\'Ponna and Kali\\' and the impact of childlessness on them. The book raises several issues about gender, patriarchy and masculinity - all of which converge in a worldview mandated by narrow social conventions that describe a childless marriage as incomplete. The controversy erupted in 2014 after local caste-based and religious Hindu groups objected to the fictional portrayal of traditions at the Ardhanareeswarar Temple in Tiruchengode. Then, on July 2016, the Madras High Court dismissed the case under citing Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India, ruled that there was no binding force or obligation that forced the author to apologize and withdraw the books."
