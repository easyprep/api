  "explanation": "The first English trade post on the eastern coast of India was established at Pettapooly, lying around 36 miles west of Masulipatnam. Captain Hippon in the ship \"Globe\"  landed there on 20 August 1611. The British had first touched Pulicat but were sent away by Dutch from there. It was not a factory but a trade post in Masulipatnam. Around two years later, British obtained their first treaty of protection from the Mughal Emperor Jahangir, and by that time, had started factory at Surat."
