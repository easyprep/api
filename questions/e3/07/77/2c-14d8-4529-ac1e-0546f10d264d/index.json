  "question": "A and B can do a piece of work in 72 days. B and C can do it in 120 days, A and C can do it in 90 days. In how many days all the three together can do the work ?",
  "option1": "150 days",
  "option2": "60 days",
  "option3": "80 days",
  "option4": "100 days",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "60 days",
  "explanation": "According to question, \r\n(A + B)\\'s one day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{72}&s=1$\r\n(B + C)\\'s one day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{120}&s=1$\r\nand (C + A)\\'s one day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{90}&s=1$\r\nOn adding all three, \r\n2 (A + B + C)\\'s one day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{72}+ \\\\frac{1}{120}+ \\\\frac{1}{90}&s=1$\r\n$latex = \\\\frac{5+3+4}{360} = \\\\frac{1}{30}&s=1$\r\n∴ (A + B + C)\\'s one day\\'s work $latex = \\\\frac{1}{60}&s=1$\r\n∴ A, B and C together can finish the whole work in 60 days.\r\nHence option [B] is the right answer."
