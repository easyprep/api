  "explanation": "For the first time, the astronomers at the University College London have discovered water vapour in the atmosphere of an Earth-size planet called K2-18b. They used data from NASA\\'s Hubble Space Telescope. The exoplanet “K2-18b” is 8-times the mass of Earth and known as a super-Earth. It orbits a red dwarf star 110 light-years away from Earth in the Leo constellation. The planet was first discovered in 2015 by NASA\\'s Kepler spacecraft. An exoplanet refers to a planet beyond our solar system."
