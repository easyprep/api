  "option2": "Raising vertical farms",
  "option3": "Waste Water Treatment",
  "option4": "Protection of Wildlife",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Waste Water Treatment",
  "explanation": "Green bridge technology approach is developed by Shristi Eco Research Institute (SERI), Pune. It is based on filtration, biodegradation and biosorption mechanisms by microbes and plants. It is a combination of Ecofert â€“ which is an active microbial consortia, biomats, sand, gravels and plants. The stones/boulders act as a filtering material and prevent the solids from passing through the bridges. The green plants/flora grown at the banks of the water body also contributes towards the treatment of the wastewater. [Source:Centre for Science and Environment]"
