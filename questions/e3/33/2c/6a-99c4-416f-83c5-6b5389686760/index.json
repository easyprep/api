  "question": "In context of the Inter-state River Water Dispute (amendment) bill, 2019, passed in the Lok Sabha, consider the following statements:\n<ol>\n<li>The bill, when enacted, would replace all existing tribunals with a single tribunal.</li>\n<li>A Dispute Resolution Committee would be approached before going to the tribunal level.</li>\n<li>A decision from tribunal level resolution is final and binding on the parties.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "1 and 3",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "None of the above",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is correct:\nCurrently, the existing tribunals have shown low performance on the fronts of timely resolution and also the number of resolutions awarded. Only 4 out of the 9 tribunals have awarded decisions in cases. These took a long time, ranging from 7 to 28 years. The bill seeks to correct this by consolidating the tribunals into a single central body with multiple benches. The tribunal will operate on a time frame (disputes to be resolved in 2 years- extendable by a year).\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe bill will set up a Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC). The DRC will seek to amicably resolve the disputes between the states. It will be composed of a chairperson and an expert with at least 15 years’ experience. It will also have members from the disputing states. This process is to be completed in a year (extendable by 6 months). If this fails, the states will approach the tribunal.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe tribunal will deliver its resolution within a time frame and this decision is binding on the parties. The order is equivalent to a Supreme Court order. The bill also mandates the central government to set up scheme in support of the tribunal’s decision.\n&nbsp;"
