Adi Shankaracharya was born over 1,200 years ago in Kerala. He was a spiritual leader, a Vedantic philosopher, a monk, a scholar and an explorer. His contributions are continued to be a guide to everyday life. He established four Peethas - in the north, south, east and west. These Peethas were and are different - and at once they were and are the same. That is the beauty of India.",
