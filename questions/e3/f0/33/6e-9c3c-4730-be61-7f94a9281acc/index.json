  "question": "In context with the release of the 10<sup>th</sup> edition of Global Wealth Report, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is released by World Bank.</li>\n<li>Population size affects a countryâ€™s wealth.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",

  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Global Wealth report is released by the Credit Suisse Group. It is a multinational investment bank that is based in Switzerland. The 2019 report is the 10<sup>th</sup> edition of the report. Net worth of the individuals is used to calculate wealth.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nPopulation size is one of the factors affecting the wealth of a country. A larger population size reduces the wealth enjoyed by a person. On the other hand, a larger population also means a larger market and more potential for increasing economic activity. Also, when properly developed, the population serves as human capital."
