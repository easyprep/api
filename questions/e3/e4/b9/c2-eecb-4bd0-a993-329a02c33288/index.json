  "question": "Which country houses the \"Kunta Kinteh Island\"?",
  "option1": "The Gambia",
  "option2": "Ghana",
  "option3": "Gabon",
  "option4": "Guinea",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "The Gambia",
  "explanation": "Kunta Kinteh Island, formerly called James Island and St Andrew's Island, is an island in the Gambia River, located in the country of the Gambia. Fort James is located on the island.Â  As an important historical site in the West African slave trade, it is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, together with related sites including Albreda, Juffureh and Fort Bullen. Kunta Kinteh Island is suffering heavy erosion and is now approximately 1/6 of its size during the time when the fort was active. Ruins of several of the British administrative buildings (including a single cell, apparently used to house the most troublesome captives), a small jetty and a number of skeletal baobab trees remain. The ruins have been stabilised and protected by a capping. Because the island is low-lying, during high tide and storms sometimes waves will beat against some of the surviving structures."
