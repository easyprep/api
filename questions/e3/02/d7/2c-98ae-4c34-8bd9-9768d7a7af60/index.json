  "question": "What is the reason for different molecular arrangements as per VSEPR theory?",
  "option1": "To minimize mutual repulsion",
  "option2": "To minimize mutual attraction",
  "option3": "To minimize surface tension",
  "option4": "To have the minimum area",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "To minimize mutual repulsion",
  "explanation": "As per the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, the electron pairs (both bonding and non-bonding) around the central atom in a molecule arrange themselves in space in such a way that they minimize their mutual repulsion."
