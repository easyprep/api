  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is correct</u>. Nabakalebara is a festival observed in the Shree Jagannath Temple of Puri in Odisha. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u>. The festival involves the symbolic recreation of the wooden forms Jagannath, Balabhadra, Subhadra and Sudarshana. The wooden forms are made from special type of neem trees. Naba means new and Kalebara is body. It is the re-embodiment of Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra, Devi Subhadra and Sudarshan when they relinquish their old bodies and assume a new one. The Nabakalebara Niti is observed in a gap of 12 to 19 years. Most of the Nabakalebars are performed after a gap of almost 19 years. The festival was recently in the news when the President Ram Nath Kovind has released Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 10 commemorative coins on the occasion."
