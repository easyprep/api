  "question": "Consider the following statements with respect to the Thermionic emission:<br> 1. It is caused by electrons or ions that break loose from the metal surface due to heat energy<br> 2. A metal cannot emit thermions at all temperatures<br> Which among the above statements is / are correct ?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The thermionic emission is cased by electrons or ions that break loose from the metal surface due to heat energy. The minimum heat energy required to make a metal emit an electron (thermion), from its surface is called threshold energy or work function. Electron volt (eV): It is the smallest unit of work and is generally used to measure threshold energy. It is defined as the amount of work done, when a charge of 1.6 × 10<sup>–19</sup> coulombs (charge of one electron), moves through two points in an electric field, at a potential difference of one volt. 1 eV = 1.6 × 10<sup>–19 </sup>C × V = 1.6 × l0<sup>–19</sup> J. The minimum temperature at which a particular material emits thermions from its surface on heating is called threshold temperature. A metal cannot emit thermions at all temperatures. The thermions are emitted by a metal only when its temperature is higher than the threshold temperature. (b) 1eV = 1.6 × l0<sup>–19</sup> C × 1 V = 1.6 × l0<sup>–19</sup> J"
