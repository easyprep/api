  "question": "When water is heated from 0°C to 10°C, what will happen to its volume?",
  "option1": "increases",
  "option2": "decreases",
  "option3": "does not change",
  "option4": "first decreases and then increases",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "first decreases and then increases",
  "explanation": "Initially at start of heating from 0°C to 4°C there will be a contraction as a result of which volume decreases. On further heating beyond 4°C to 10°C the molecules gain kinetic energy and start moving more randomly. Thus, intermolecular distance increases as a result of which its volume increases."
