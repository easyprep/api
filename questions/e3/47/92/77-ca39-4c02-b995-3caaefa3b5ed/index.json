  "question": "Consider the following statements about the term “Bharat 22” that was recently in news: <ol> <li>It is India’s first Exchange Traded Fund</li> <li>The fund will be managed by SEBI</li> <li>It aims to boost the disinvestment programme of the government</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "Only 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "First statement is incorrect because Bharat 22 is the second Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) launched by the Union Finance Ministry. Second statement is again incorrect because ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund will manage the fund. Bharat 22 comprises 22 stocks including those of central public sector enterprises, PSU banks and holdings under the Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India. The ETF is aimed at helping speed up the government's disinvestment programme. ETFs are like mutual funds but they can be sold and purchased on exchanges just like stocks. The first ETF was CPSE ETF which was launched in March 2014 for raising funds through disinvestment of its share in public sector undertakings."
