  "question": "In reference to the recent decision of the Supreme Court to consider the plea for declaring ‘Ram Sethu’ as a national heritage monument, consider the following statements about Ram Sethu:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The Ram Sethu is made up of limestone.</li>\n<li>The Sethusamudram channel project is to connect the Gulf of Kutch with the Gulf of Khambat.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Ram Sethu, also known as Adam’s Bridge, is made up of limestone shoals. The chain of these shoals is located between southern coast of India and Sri Lanka. It is believed to have been built by the mythical ‘Vanara Army’ to help Ram rescue Sita from Ravana.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Sethusamudram channel is a proposed shipping channel project off the southern coast. It is a 83km long deep water channel that will link the Palk Strait with Mannar. It would require dredging of limestone shoal and has potential to hurt the Ram Sethu."
