  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "First statement is incorrect because the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is an initiative by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation Development (OECD). The OECD provides a forum in which governments can work together to share experiences and seek solutions to common problems. Second statement is correct. The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a worldwide study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in member and non-member nations of 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance on mathematics, science, and reading. It was first performed in 2000 and then repeated every three years. Its aim is to provide comparable data with a view to enabling countries to improve their education policies and outcomes. It measures problem solving and cognition in daily life."
