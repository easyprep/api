  "option5": "",
  "answer": 1973,
  "explanation": "Guinea-Bissau gained independence in the year 1973. By the 19th century, the Portuguese were sufficiently secure in Bissau to regard the neighbouring coastline as their own special territory, also up north in part of present South Senegal. An armed rebellion, begun in 1956 by the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) under the leadership of Am√≠lcar Cabral gradually consolidated its hold on the then Portuguese Guinea. Independence was unilaterally declared on 24 September 1973, which is now celebrated as the country's Independence Day, a public holiday. Recognition became universal following 25 April 1974 socialist-inspired military coup in Portugal, which overthrew Lisbon's Estado Novo regime. Luis Cabral, brother of Amilcar and co-founder of PAIGC, was appointed the first President of Guinea-Bissau.",
