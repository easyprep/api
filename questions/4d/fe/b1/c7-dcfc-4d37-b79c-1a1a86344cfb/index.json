  "question": "Lignocellulosic biomass was highlighted by the recent agreement between IIT Madras and ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is a renewable carbon source.</li>\n<li>First generation biofuels are derived from non-food based sources.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Â Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe lignocellulosic biomass is a renewable source of carbon that has the capability to reduce GHG emission and help attain net carbon neutrality. It refers to the dry plant matter and can be used to develop biofuels and other fine chemicals. It is made of a carbohydrate polymer and lignin, which is an aromatic polymer.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nFirst generation biofuels were derived from food based biomass. This led to the food vs fuel concern where the diversion of food crops for fuel production is less ideal. The second generation biofuels are sourced from non-food based biomass such as the lignocellulosic biomass from agricultural wastes."
