  "question": "The Ajanta Caves were rebuilt during the period of which of the following rulers?",
  "option1": "Guptas",
  "option2": "Kushans",
  "option3": "Mauryas",
  "option4": "Chalukyas",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Guptas",
  "explanation": "Ajanta caves were built from the 2nd century BCE to 7th century CE. They contain some of the earliest and finest examples of Indian wall-painting. The subject matter is largely scenes from the life of Buddha. <br />Not satisfied with caves the Guptas were the first dynasty to build permanent free-standing Hindu temples and so they began a long tradition of Indian temple architecture. It is perhaps important to note here that Hindu temples were not designed for congregations but rather as the dwelling place of a deity. Finally we can say that Guptas rebuilt Ajanta Caves."
