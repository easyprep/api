  "question": "Delhi has recorded a 25% drop in its air pollution. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Delhi’s climate contributes to its air pollution.</li>\n<li>The GRAP provided that construction works can be stopped if the air pollution remains severe for more than 48 hours.</li>\n<li>Delhi is the most polluted city in the world.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option2": "Only 1 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "All are incorrect",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe seasons are a major contributor to Delhi’s air quality. The air pollution peaks during the months of November, December and January. The cold weather keeps the smog closer to the ground and traps all the pollutants with it. Dropping temperature and rising humidity contributes to poor air quality.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe GRAP/ Graded Response Action Plan was launched in 2017 to tackle air pollution in Delhi using a road map. According to its provisions, construction works can be halted and entry of trucks could be ceased if the air pollution remains severe for over 48 hours.\n<strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong>\nGurugram is the most polluted city in the world. In 2018, its recorded average pollution level was 13 times higher than the standards set by WHO. Of the top 10 cities with worst air quality, Indian cities feature at seven spots. Delhi is listed as the 11<sup>th</sup> most polluted city in the world."
