It was recently in news when the United States military dropped the America&rsquo;s largest non nuclear bomb on Nangarhar province of Afghanistan. Mosul is a major city in northern Iraq.

The Darfur region of western Sudan has been the site of terrible violence, death, and displacement named as \"Genocide\" by the United States."
