In this context, consider the following statements about ‘sexed semen’:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Sexed semen can be used to determine the sex of the calf.</li>\n<li>It makes use of flow cytometer.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",

  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nSexed semen is a processed semen in which sperms carrying either only X chromosomes or only Y chromosomes is present. The use of the former in the artificial insemination results in formation of a female calf while the latter produces a male calf.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe sexed semen is produced using an instrument called flow cytometer. It is produced through 2 methods: either selectively killing off sperms bearing one type of chromosome or removing the sperms containing one type of chromosome. Both the technique involves the use of flow cytometer."
