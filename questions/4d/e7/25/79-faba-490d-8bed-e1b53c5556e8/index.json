  "question": "With reference to the decision to establish Special Tiger Force for Corbett Tiger Reserve, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The reserve is to see a three tiered protection system.</li>\n<li>Tiger reserves in India are based on ‘core-buffer’ strategy.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Uttarakhand government has decided to set up a Special Tiger Force in line with the centre’s guidelines. It will follow a 3 tiered system of protection. The first tier will be composed of beat guards conducting regular patrols while the tier 2 will have the special tiger protection force. The third tier will involve intelligence gathering networks.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nReserves in India are established based on ‘core-buffer’ strategy. Core tiger reserves are the legally recognised sanctuaries and parks. The buffer reserves are protected but are not kept completely free of human activity, unlike the core areas. These two setups are used in sync to support even the spill-over population."
