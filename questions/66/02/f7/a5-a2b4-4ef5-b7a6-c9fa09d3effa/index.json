  "question": "The dot product of two vectors A and B is equal to the product of magnitude of A and B and __________?",
  "option1": "cosine of the largest angle between them",
  "option2": "sine of the largest angle between them",
  "option3": "cosine of the smallest angle between them",
  "option4": "sine of the smallest angle between them",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "cosine of the smallest angle between them",
  "explanation": "The dot product of two vectors A and B is equal to the product of magnitude of A and B and cosine of the smallest angle between them. A.B = A B Cos <span class=\\'symbol\\'>θ  where <span class=\\'symbol\\'>θ  = smallest angle between A and B Note: The dot product of two vectors is a scalar quantity."
