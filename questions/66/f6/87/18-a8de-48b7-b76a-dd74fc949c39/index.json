  "answer": "Competition Commission of India",
  "explanation": "The Competition Commission of India (CCI) was set up to replace the anachronistic Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (MRTPC). It was established to eliminate practices that adversely affect competition in different industries/areas and protect interests of consumers and ensure freedom of trade. The Competition Act of 2002 called for the creation of CCI. However, it was established in 2003 and became fully functional only by 2009. The CCI is a quasi-judicial body which gives opinions to statutory authorities and also deals with other cases. It has one chairman and six members. It is the youngest and the only cross-sector regulator in India."
