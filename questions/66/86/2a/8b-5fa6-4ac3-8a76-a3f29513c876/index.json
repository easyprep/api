  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\r\nCongo Fever is a viral disease that is caused by an RNA virus. It is transmitted through ticks or contact with infected livestock or even through body fluids. The disease symptoms include fever, vomiting, muscle pains, hemorrhage, liver failure etc. It may cause death in up to 25% of the cases.\r\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nNo vaccine is commercially available for the Congo Fever. The treatment is mostly supportive. The preventive measures include de-ticking farm animals before transportation. WHO had listed the disease as one of the top priority conditions against which R&amp;D works are to be expedited.\r\n<strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong>\r\nThis is not the first case of Congo Fever in India. In 2011, the country saw the first human case of the disease’s infection. It resulted in the death of 4 people in Gujarat’s Sanand. The disease tends to occur as ‘outbreaks’."
