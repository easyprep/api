The radicals and leftists wanted to launch a mass Civil Disobedience Movement, but here Gandhi insisted on Individual Satyagraha. The Individual Satyagraha was not to seek independence but to affirm the right of speech.\r\n\r\nThe first Satyagrahi selected was Acharya Vinoba Bhave, who was sent to Jail when he spoke against the war.\r\nSecond Satyagrahi was Jawahar Lal Nehru.\r\nThird was Brahma Datt, one of the inmates of the Gandhi’s Ashram"
