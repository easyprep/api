  "question": "On which of the following factors the breaking stress depends?",
  "option1": "Area of cross-section",
  "option2": "length of the material",
  "option3": "Nature of the material",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Nature of the material",
  "explanation": "Breaking force = P Ã— A Here P is a constant of proportionality and known as breaking stress. Breaking stress is constant for a given material and does not depend upon the dimension (length or thickness) of wire."
