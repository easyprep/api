  "question": "The Centre’s Market Intervention Price Scheme is aiding the ailing Apple sector of Kashmir. In this context, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>MIPS is to prevent distress sale of the fruits.</li>\n<li>Most of the apple output in India is produced in Kashmir.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe MIPS is a price support mechanism for horticulture products. This is because the minimum support price scheme does not apply to horticultural crops. The MIPS is to prevent distress sale by the farmers. The application to Kashmir is expected to raise the farmers income in Kashmir by 2,000 crore INR.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:        </strong>\nKashmir is a major producer of apples in India and it contributed 73% of the total output in 2018. This is 20 lakh metric tonnes of apples. The apples are exported using trucks. But given the lockdown situation and terrorist attacks on the growers, the exports have been hit."
