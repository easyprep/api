  "answer": "Rs. 40,700",
  "explanation": "Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) provides comprehensive risk solution at the lowest uniform premium across the country for farmers. As an end to end risk mitigation mechanism for farmers, the scheme extends coverage for the entire cropping cycle from pre-sowing to post-harvest including coverage for losses arising out of prevented sowing and mid-season adversities. Individual farm level losses arising out of localized calamities and post-harvest losses are also covered due to perils such as inundation, cloudburst and natural fire. The average sum insured per hectare has increased from Rs. 15,100 during the pre-PMFBY Schemes to Rs. 40,700 under PMFBY.",
