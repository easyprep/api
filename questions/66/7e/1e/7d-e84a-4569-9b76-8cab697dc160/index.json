  "answer": "Jonas Salk",
  "explanation": "The World Polio Day (WPD) is observed every year on 24 October by the World Health Organization (WHO)  to create awareness about the hazards of the crippling disease. The day also observed to   commemorate the birth of American medical researcher and virologist Jonas Salk, who successful discovered and developed the first polio vaccine  (or  poliomyelitis) that came into use  in 1955.  The oral polio vaccine was developed by Albert Sabin and came into commercial use in 1961. The 2018 theme is ‘End Polio Now’. Polio is a crippling and potentially fatal infectious disease. There is no cure, but there are safe and effective vaccines. Polio can be prevented through immunization. Polio vaccine, given multiple times, almost always protects a child for life. The strategy to eradicate polio is therefore based on preventing infection by immunizing every child until transmission stops and the world is polio-free."
