  "question": "Which of the following properties are shown by “Quark”, a type of elementary particle? <ol> <li>Mass</li> <li>Electric Charge</li> <li>Colour</li> <li>Spin</li> </ol> Select the correct option from codes given below:",
  "option1": "2 & 4 Only",
  "option2": "1, 3 & 4 Only",
  "option3": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "option4": "None",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "Quarks have many intrinsic properties like mass, electric charge, colour and spin. They are the only elementary particles in the Standard Model of particle physics to experience all four fundamental interactions (electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interactions and weak interaction). Also, Quarks are the only known particles whose electric charges are not integer multiples of their elementary charges. There are six types of quarks: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. Quarks have the unusual characteristic of having a fractional electric charge, unlike the proton and electron, which have integer charges of +1 and -1 respectively."
