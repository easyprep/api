  "explanation": "Chiru is the common name of Tibetan antelope (Pantolops hodgsonii), and it is a threatened species of Antelopes. To enhance protection of Chiru, its prime habitats have been declared as Wildlife Sanctuaries viz. Karakorma Wildlife Sanctuary and Changthang Cold Desert Wildlife Sanctuary. I just wanted to make you aware that Jammu &amp; Kashmir Government has its own wildlife Protection act of 1978. Chiru is in list I of that act and it is also protected by the Indian wildlife act. Thus it one of the few species which are protected by the two acts."
