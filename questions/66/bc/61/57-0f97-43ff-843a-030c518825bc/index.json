  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 & 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "Etchplain is a plain where the bedrock has been subject to considerable subsurface weathering is called an Etchplain. The process of the formation of Etchplains is called Etchplantation.<br />Flared slope is a rock-wall with a smooth transition into a concavity at the foot zone is called a Flared zone. They are found in a variety of climates. They are most common in granitic rocks."
