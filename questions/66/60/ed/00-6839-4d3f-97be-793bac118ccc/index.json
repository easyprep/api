  "option2": "Locke",
  "option3": "Rousseau",
  "option4": "Plato",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Rousseau",
  "explanation": "Rousseau in his theory of social contract made an important contribution to the theory of sovereignty, by introducing the doctrine of popular sovereignty as he made people themselves as sovereign. He held that when people surrender their natural liberty in their individual capacity, sovereignty is retained by the people themselves in their corporate capacity which is represented by general will. Therefore, he suggested that sovereignty belongs to the people and could be exercised only in an assembly of the whole people."
