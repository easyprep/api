  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2 are correct",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "Scientists announced the recent discovery of Yaravirus, a never before seen virus that is unique from all known viruses of its kind, in Brazil.\r\n<strong>Yaravirus infects amoeba.</strong>\r\nThe Yaravirus is a newly discovered virus that infects amoeba. It does not affect humans. It is much smaller (80nm) than other viruses (over 200nm) that target amoeba. Though the species is newly discovered, scientists say that the virus has been existing on Earth for ages.\r\n<strong>It was discovered in Brazil.</strong>\r\nThe Yaravirus was discovered in Brazil. It was discovered in the artificially created Lake Pampulha. The virus is named after Yara, ‘the mother of waters’, from the mythical stories of the Tupi Guarani people- an indigenous tribe. The new virus poses a challenge to how DNA based viruses are classified.\r\n<strong>Most of the components of the virus’ genome had not been observed before.</strong>\r\nThe Yaravirus is unique both in terms of phylogeny and origin. About 90% of its genome has not been observed by scientists in other viruses. It lacks all of the ‘classical viral genes’. The viral particles are composed of a huge amount of unknown proteins according to the scientists."
