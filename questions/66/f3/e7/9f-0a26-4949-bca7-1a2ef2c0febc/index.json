The major highlight of the discovery is a rare half-an-hour footage that has visuals of a special train carrying Mahatma Gandhiâ€™s ashes, after his assasination on 30th January 1948, from Madras to Rameshwaram. In 1964, the NFAI was established as a media unit of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (I&B) with headquarters at Pune, Maharashtra."
