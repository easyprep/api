  "option1": "1 and 2",
  "option2": "3 only",
  "option3": "2 only",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 only",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe NPR is not the same as NRC. NPR is an exercise to create a comprehensive database of every usual resident in the country. It will be carried out throughout the country except Assam, as the NRC exercise is taking place there. The NPR will contain demographic as well as biometric data of the usual residents. \n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nUsual residents are those who have been residing in a local area for a minimum period of 6 months. It can also be applied to persons who intend to be resident in a local area for a period of 6 months or more. The NPR is created under the provisions of the Citizenship Act, 1955. The NPR is used for making the National Register of Indian Citizens/ NRIC after verification of their citizenship status. \n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nIt is mandatory only for all resident citizens to be registered in the NPR. An NRI/ non-resident Indian would not count as usual resident until he/she resides for a minimum of 6 months. Hence it is not mandatory for an NRI to be registered in NPR until he/she becomes usual resident."
