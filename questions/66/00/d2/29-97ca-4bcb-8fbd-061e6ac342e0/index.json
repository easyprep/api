  "answer": "Science for the People and the People for Science",
  "explanation": "The National Science Day (NSD)  is observed every yearon 28th of February to mark the discovery of Raman effect by Physicist C V Raman on 28th February, 1928. For his discovery, Sir CV Raman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930. In honour of this discovery and as a mark of tribute to the scientist, National Science Day was marked for the first time on February 28, 1987. The purpose of the day is to spread the message of importance of science and its application among the people. This year, the theme for the 2019 NSD is, \\'Science for the People and the People for Science\\'. The Raman Effect is the inelastic scattering of a photon by molecules which are excited to higher energy levels.  It forms the basis for Raman spectroscopy which is used by chemists and physicists to gain information about materials."
