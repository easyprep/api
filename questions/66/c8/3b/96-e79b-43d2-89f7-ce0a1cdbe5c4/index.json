  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Integrated Space Cell is the nodal agency within the government of India which oversees the security of its space based military and civilian hardware systems. It was formed in June 2010 in view of the growing threat to India’s space based assets. The announcement came as a response, when China used a medium-range ballistic missile to shoot down one of its own aging satellites.  While India remains committed to weapons-free space, emergence of offensive counter space systems and anti-satellite weaponry posed new threats which had to be countered. The Cell is jointly operated by the three Armed Forces, Department of Space, and ISRO. The Cell has been set up to utilize more effectively the country’s space-based assets for military purposes and to look at threats to these assets. It functions under the Integrated Defense Services Headquarters of Ministry of Defence."
