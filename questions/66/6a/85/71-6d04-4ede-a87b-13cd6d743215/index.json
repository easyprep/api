  "question": "Consider the following statements: <ol> <li>Regur soil has high moisture retention capacity due to presence of clay</li> <li>Laterite soil is reddish / yellowish in colour due to presence of Iron Oxides</li> </ol> Which of the above is / are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "<strong>Regur Soil</strong> This is the fertile black cotton soil developed over volcanic rocks particularly basalt in the North western part of the Deccan Plateau. The soil in clay and due to this, it has a high moisture retention capacity. Due to high clay content, the soil becomes sticky when wet and becomes hard and develop cracks when dry. Regur soils are rich in ferrous, magnesium, alumina, lime and potash. Cotton, millets, sugarcane, tobacco, oilseeds, grams are largely grown on these soils <strong>Laterite Soil</strong> Laterite soils are reddish or yellowish in colour due to the presence of iron oxides. They are formed in the areas of heavy rainfall with alternating wet and dry seasons. Precipitation causes the leaching away of limes and silica and the heavier iron and aluminium compounds are remains left. Laterite soils occurs in the plateau regions, mainly found on the summits of Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats, Rajmahal Hills, Vindhyas, Satpuras and Malwa Plateau. They are acidic in nature and suitable for growing plantation crops like tea, coffee, rubber etc."
