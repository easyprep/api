Felsic rocks are rich in silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, and potassium, while the Mafic rocks are rich in magnesium and iron. If the rock is highly dominated by Magnesium and Iron, it is called Ultramafic. Second statement is not correct because Granite is a Felsic rock. Third statement is correct."
