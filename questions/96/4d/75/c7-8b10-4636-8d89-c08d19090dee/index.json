  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe draft code provides that the maternity benefits can be availed by all women for the period of actual absence. This period stretches from the day preceding the child birth and any period immediately following that day. The employer is held liable for the payment of benefits.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe draft code also gives provisions for gig workers and platform workers. The central government may formulate welfare schemes for such workers. This will cover aspects like maternity benefits, old age protections, health benefits, life and disability cover, etc."
