  "question": "Which among the following was not a feature in the proposed Union of India by the Cabinet plan?",
  "option1": "Weak Centre with limited powers",
  "option2": "Residuary powers vested in the Centre",
  "option3": "Indiaâ€™s right to cede from the Commonwealth",
  "option4": "All the members of the Interim cabinet would be Indians",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Residuary powers vested in the Centre",
  "explanation": "The Union Government and its legislature were to have limited powers, dealing with Finance, Foreign Affairs and Communications. The union would have powers necessary to raise the finances to manage the subjects. Thus, the Cabinet Mission plan proposed a weak Centre. We can realize what would have been of the country if this plan was approved and implemented. All subjects other than the Union Subjects and all the residuary powers would be vested in the provinces. The Princely states would retain all subjects and all residuary powers."
