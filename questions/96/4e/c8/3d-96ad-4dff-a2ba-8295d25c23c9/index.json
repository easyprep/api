  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 and 2",
  "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct:\nThe PSC system was derived from the British parliamentary system. The first such committee in Britain was constituted in 1571. A public accounts committee, one of the most powerful (a finance committee), was setup in 1861. In India, a public accounts committee was constituted in 1950. Such finance committees exert considerable influence over the executive.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is correct:\nThe two main types of parliamentary committees are standing and select committees. The standing panel are uninterrupted but are reconstituted annually. They are for subjects that require continuous perusal of issues and frequent modification for delivering a well-functioning legislation. The select committees are formed for a specific bill, when expert insight is required. The use of PSC gives significant value addition to the bills.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is incorrect:\nIt is not mandatory to refer a bill to a PSC. It is done only to improve the efficiency and render a well thought-out law. Also, it is under the chairpersonâ€™s power to refer the bill to a panel. This is done in consultation with the party leaders in the house. A bill on education, need not necessarily be sent to the standing committee. It can also be sent to a specially constituted select committee for that purpose."
