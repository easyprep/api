  "explanation": "The Agni-5 is the fifth variant and the most advanced missile in the Agni series. The missile has been made in a manner that after reaching the peak of its trajectory it will head down to the earthâ€™s surface, towards the target, under the gravitational pull. <u>First statement is correct</u>. The missile is capable of delivering a nuclear warhead. <u>Second statement is correct</u>. The missile has a strike range of 5500km. <u>Third statement is incorrect</u>. Agni-V is not a cruise missile. It is a solid fuelled intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) developed by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Once the Agni-V is inducted, India will join the super exclusive club of countries with ICBMs (missiles with a range of over 5,000-5,500km) alongside the US, Russia, China, France and the UK. It has been manufactured under the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program."
