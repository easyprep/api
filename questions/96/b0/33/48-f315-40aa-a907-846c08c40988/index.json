  "question": "Identify the soil with the help of given information: <ol> <li>It is mainly formed over basalt rocks and in the low rainfall areas</li> <li>The soil is rich in clay and due to this it has a high moisture retention capacity and is good for dry farming</li> <li>It contains high proportion of calcium and magnesium carbonates</li> <li>It is poor in organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus</li> </ol>  Select the correct answer from options given below:",
  "option1": "Alluvial Soil",
  "option2": "Black Soil",
  "option3": "Red Soil",
  "option4": "Laterite Soil",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Black Soil",
  "explanation": "<u>All given features are of Black soil</u>. It is mainly developed over volcanic rocks. The black colour of the soil is due to the presence of sesquioxides of iron and aluminium. The soil is not completely leached due to its formation in low rainfall area and the color imparting mineral compounds remain in the upper layers of the soil. Black soil belongs to the chernozem group, a soil of dark color associated with grasslands. It is also known as regur soil. Black soil occurs in vast areas in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, it also occurs in small pockets in Uttar Pradesh and eastern Rajasthan. Black soil is rich in some of the soluble plant nutrients such as potash, lime, aluminum, calcium and magnesium carbonates but it is generally deficient in nitrogen, phosphorous and organic matter."
