  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 and 3 are correct",
  "option3": "All are incorrect",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nPCOS is a health condition, as opposed to a disease, that affects 20% of the women in India. It is caused due to hormonal imbalance. It causes multiple immature follicles in various stages of development to accumulate in the ovary.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nA high BMI increases the risk of acquiring PCOS in women. BMI is the body mass divided by the square of the height. An ideal BMI is 25. When the BMI increases to over 27 or 28, the risk factors increase. A high value can be caused due to obesity.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nThe incidence of PCOS increases the risk of acquiring diseases like diabetes. This is due to insulin resistance which causes diabetes type 2. Other metabolic disorders arising due to PCOS are gestational diabetes, stroke, high blood pressure, cardiac diseases, etc.\n&nbsp;"
