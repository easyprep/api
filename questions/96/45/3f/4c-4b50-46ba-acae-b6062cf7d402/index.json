  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "An&nbsp;avalanche&nbsp;is a sudden flow of snow down a&nbsp;slope, such as a&nbsp;mountainside. The first statement is correct because&nbsp;Himalayan range experiences more avalanches than any other place on Earth. Second statement is also correct because snowmobile leads to to avalanches if&nbsp;slab is not well anchored to the ground,&nbsp;<em>leading</em>&nbsp;to severe&nbsp;<em>avalanche</em>&nbsp;conditions."
