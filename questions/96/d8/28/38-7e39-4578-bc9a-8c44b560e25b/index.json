In context of this scheme, aspirational districts refer to selected 115 backward districts that are lagging on specific development parameters. Central Government has undertaken a major policy initiative for rapid transformation of these districts and senior government officials have been assigned responsibility to coordinate the efforts of the Centre and states in facilitating development in such districts. With the exit of West Bengal, Kerala and Odisha, total number of districts under this scheme has now reduced to 102 from 115.",
