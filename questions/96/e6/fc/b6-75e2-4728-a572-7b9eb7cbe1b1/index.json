  "question": "In context with the decade long Deep Carbon Observatory concluding its projects in October, consider the following statements about Samail Ophiolite:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>It is located in Saudi Arabia.</li>\n<li>The Samail Ophiolite sequesters carbon from the atmosphere.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe Samail Ophiolite is in Oman. It is a segment of oceanic crust located in the Hajar Mountains. Ophiolite is a portion of the oceanic crusts that has been uplifted along with its underlying upper mantle. It covers an area of about 100,000 sq.km.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nSamail Ophiolite has been discovered to sequester carbon from the atmosphere. Microbes along with the weathering process in this ophiolite has been converting atmospheric carbon dioxide into carbonate mineral. The system has given insights into the ways to sequester carbon from the atmosphere."
