  "option1": "Plato",
  "option2": "Aristotle",
  "option3": "Machiavelli",
  "option4": "Rousseau",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Aristotle",
  "explanation": "In Ancient Greek's city-states, very few inhabitants enjoyed the status of 'freemen' who were treated as full citizens. These citizens were equal among themselves as regards their rights. There was no discrimination between the rich and the poor among the freemen. The rest of the community comprised of slaves, women and aliens who had no rights of citizenship. That is why Aristotle regarded Citizenship as a privilege of the ruling class. In this sense, citizenship stood for effective participation in the exercise of power."
