  "explanation": "The “Indo-Pacific Freedom Corridor” project is between India and Japan and focuses on creating infrastructure and connectivity that can somehow counterbalance the OBOR.

Both India and Japan have also proposed to develop the “Mekong-India Economic Corridor (MIEC)” connecting the Kenya-Tanzania-Mozambique (KTM) growth zone through Jawaharlal Nehru and Kochi ports, which will open up new vistas of Africa-Asia connectivity and unlock Africa\\'s economic potential. Further, the Asia-Africa connectivity project aims at developing quality infrastructure (Partnership for Quality Infrastructure) in India, which is the central theme of Japan\\'s collaboration with India. To accelerate the process India and Japan will be holding separate sessions with stakeholders from Africa on the sidelines of the Africa Development Bank meeting. Japan\\'s state minister of finance will lead the country\\'s delegation at the meet."
