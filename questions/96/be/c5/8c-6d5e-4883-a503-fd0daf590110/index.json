  "question": "Which of the following nutrient cycle is a sedimentary cycle?<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Hydrological cycle</li>\n<li>Carbon cycle</li>\n<li>Phosphorous cycle</li>\n<li>Nitrogen cycle</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Select the correct answer from the codes given below-",
  "option1": "1,2,3,4",
  "option2": "1,2 and 4 only",
  "option3": "3 only",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "3 only",
