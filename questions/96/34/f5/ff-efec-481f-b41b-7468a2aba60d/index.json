  "question": "Bougainville, which is in news recently, is the province of which country?",
  "option1": "Solomon Islands",
  "option2": "Fiji",
  "option3": "Kiribati",
  "option4": "Papua New Guinea",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Papua New Guinea",
  "explanation": "The people of Bougainville have started casting vote in a referendum on independence from Papua New Guinea (PNG). If the vote for independence passes, the autonomous province with 206,000 people could become the world\\'s newest independent nation. The referendum is part of a peace deal in 2001 that ended a bloody civil war between Bougainville and PNG. The referendum presents two options, either greater autonomy from PNG, or complete independence. However, the referendum is nonbinding and a vote for independence would require ratification from the Papuan Parliament. Bougainville  is the small archipelago of Pacific islands.  Its history includes colonial exploitation, attempts at independence, a 9-year war and a gradual peace process."
