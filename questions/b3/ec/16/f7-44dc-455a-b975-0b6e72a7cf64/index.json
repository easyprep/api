  "question": "The persistence of the Brown Plant Hopper in the paddy fields of Odisha had been highlighted recently. In this context, consider the following statements about this pest:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The insect infests paddy plants during the early growth stages only.</li>\n<li>Increased use of nitrogenous fertilisers decreases the hopper population.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe brown plant hopper is one of the most important pests of paddy crops. They affect the plant during all growth stages. They cause a condition called ‘hopper burn’ in the paddy plants. They also can transmit plant viruses like rice grassy stunt virus and rice ragged stunt virus.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nOveruse of nitrogenous fertilizers have been known to increase the brown plant hopper population. The overuse of insecticides also contribute to their outbreaks. The overuse of chemicals destroys the population of their natural predator and contribute to pest attacks.\n&nbsp;"
