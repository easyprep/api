  "question": "Consider the following statements about Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR): <ol> <li>It is a treaty which imposes legally binding obligations on members over proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) </li> <li>Both India and China are its founder members</li> </ol>  Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "First statement is incorrect because MTCR is not a treaty and does not impose any legally binding obligations on members. Rather, it is an informal political understanding between members which seek to limit the proliferations of missiles and missile technology. Second statement is again incorrect because the regime was formed in 1987 by the G-7 industrialized countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the United States). While India became its member state in 2016, China is still not its member."
