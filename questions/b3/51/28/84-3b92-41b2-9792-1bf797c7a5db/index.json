  "answer": "2 Only",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because Solar Charkha Scheme is an initiative by the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) and not by the Ministry of New &amp; Renewable Energy. <u>Second statement is correct.</u> Its main objective is to employ one lakh women in each parliamentary constituency and cover them under social security schemes. Also, the scheme aims to increase the Khadi sales in the country. Solar charkha mission aims to establish 500 clusters, almost one in every parliamentary constituency. Through this scheme, the government aims to create employment for five crore people in 5 years. Presently, the solar charkha scheme is in operation in Surat (Gujarat), Nawada (Bihar), and Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh), however, the national launch of the solar charkha scheme will begin soon in Maharashtra. The conditions in Maharashtra and Gujarat are considered good for textiles industry due to the availability of black soil and high cotton production."
