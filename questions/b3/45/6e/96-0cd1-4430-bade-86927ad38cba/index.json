  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe joint study by PAU and ICAR/ Indian Council of Agricultural Research led to the development of the 7R model for farmer suicide prevention. Religious support is one of the aspects of the model. The other aspects are remunerative agriculture, resilience building, rational expenditure, reassurance through connectivity, righteous conduct and responsible reporting.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe 7D model was also developed by PAU. It gives the factors that confound and trigger farmer suicides. The 7 D factors are drugs, debt, disease, disputes, depression, disrepute and death. The factors are to be overcome with the help of 7R model."
