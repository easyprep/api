  "question": "Consider the following statements about the Dhara Mustard Hybrid-11 (DMH-11): <ol> <li>It is the first public sector edible oil crop developed indigenously</li> <li>It has been developed using the Barnase-barstar system</li> </ol> Which of the above statements is/are correct?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "First statement is correct. Deepak Pental, a Professor of Genetics, at the University of Delhi, has been credited for developing Dhara Mustard Hybrid-11 (DMH-11). GM Mustard project was funded completely by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) &#8211; the largest producer and supplier of Dhara Brand Edible Oil in the country. The major problem with mustard is that it is a self pollinating crop and hence difficult to breed for the hybrid vigour, thereby, reducing its yield in the field. The newly developed DMH-11 is based on the technology called Barnase-barstar which aims at enhancing heterosis&nbsp;(increase in the level of production traits due to cross breeding) in mustard to increase its yield."
