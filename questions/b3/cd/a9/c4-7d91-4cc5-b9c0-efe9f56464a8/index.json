The programâ€™s aim is to create awareness and interest in science among the masses, especially in unserved and underserved areas. The program was launched in 1965.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe program will use MSE buses to take the exhibit to the people. In Ladakh, 25 new buses were launched for this purpose. These will serve aspirational districts across the country. The first such bus was launched in 1966 from Birla Industrial and Technological Museum, Kolkatta.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nThis is a program under the National Council for Science Museum. This is in collaboration with the science and technology department. This is the longest running program under the council. The council is an autonomous body under the culture ministry."
