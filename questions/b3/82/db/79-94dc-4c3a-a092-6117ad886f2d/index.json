In November 2017, Tamil Nadu State Expert Appraisal Committee had observed that proposed site forms part of the catchment area of various streams that contribute to the Vaigai watershed. Among these, most important condition is to obtain Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) consent to establish and operate the project. The INO project, jointly supported by Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) and Department of Science and Technology (DST) envisages building a world class underground laboratory to study properties of neutrinos (subatomic particles produced by the decay of radioactive elements).",
