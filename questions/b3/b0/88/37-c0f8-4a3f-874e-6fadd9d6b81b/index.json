  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "This question is asking you about the fall outs of large number of elderly people or children in the population. Large numbers of young and/or old people tend to burden the economy as the consumption needs of economically non-productive members of the society reduce the overall capacity for saving and investing. Countries with a large younger population would have to spend more in terms of providing infrastructure for schools and pediatric hospitals etc. Also funds will have to be spent on day-care facilities and education for parents. Countries with a larger aging population will have to provide places like senior homes etc.<br />1. Thus, government expenditure on such services would increase so statement 1 is incorrect.<br />2. The second statement is correct. Capital Formation is linked to productivity in the economy, for which working population is look upon.<br />3. Third statement is also correct. Children may not be paying taxes because they donâ€™t have income. Elderly people pay less taxes because government gives them tax rebates."
