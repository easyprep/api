  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "Terephthalic acid- a major chemical precursor of PET increases the chances of breast cancer. PET leaches harmful chemical compounds like- di-ethylhexyl phthalate, endocrine disruptors, bisphenol A (BPA), antimony, acetaldehyde and other estrogenic compounds. BPA which acts as a faux-estrogen, interferes with various reproductive hormones in women- pre-term birth, low birth weight, congenital defects, pregnancy loss, impaired immune development, impairment of fertility and reproduction in both mother and child. Excessive and continued used of PET bottles can lead to leaching of endocrine disruptors which cause chromosomal abnormalities, birth defects and developmental disabilities in uterus like early onset of puberty in children. BPA can also cause hyperactivity disorders and aggressive behaviour in young girls. Another toxin DEHA di-(2-ethylhexyl)adipate is said to be leached and cause liver problems, cancer etc. in humans."
