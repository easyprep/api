  "option4": "1, 2, 3, 4 & 5",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2, 3, 4 & 5",
  "explanation": "The Din-i Ilahi was essentially an ethical system, prohibiting such sins as lust, sensuality, slander, and pride and enjoining the virtues of piety, prudence, abstinence, and kindness. The soul was encouraged to purify itself through its yearning for God (a tenet of Sufism, Islamic mysticism), celibacy was condoned (as in Roman Catholicism), and the slaughter of animals was forbidden (as in Jainism). There were no sacred scriptures or a priestly hierarchy in the Din-i Ilahi. In its ritual, it borrowed heavily from Zoroastrianism, making light (sun and fire) an object of divine worship and reciting, as in Hinduism, the 1,000 Sanskrit names of the sun."
