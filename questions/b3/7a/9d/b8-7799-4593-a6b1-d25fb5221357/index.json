  "question": "The first ever Maritime Museum of India is to be established at which place?",
  "option1": "Lothal",
  "option2": "Bhangarh",
  "option3": "Dibrugarh",
  "option4": "Kovalam",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Lothal",
  "explanation": "The Government of India is planning to establish a National Maritime Heritage Museum at Lothal in Gujarat. The museum will also act as an independent research center for archaeology of boat building, reconstruction of maritime history and materials traded. It will hold display of salvaged materials from shipwreck sites in Indian Ocean waters. India has vast potential with its rich maritime history. The archaeological evidence from South East Asia and Persian Gulf say that Indian maritime voyagers ventured into eastern and western seas even before 4000 years ago. Studying about sunken ships will help to fill in gaps in Indiaâ€™s maritime history and trade links with other countries."
