  "option3": "Subrahmanyam Jaishankar",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Syed Akbaruddin",
  "explanation": "India was represented by Indian envoy to United Nations Syed Akbaruddin at the 2019 Non Aligned Movement (NAM) Ministerial Meeting in Caracas, Venezuela. Here, India has strongly rejected Pakistanâ€™s references to Kashmir & said that the global forum can never be a platform for a self-serving narrative that aims to undermine the territorial integrity of one nation by another state. The NAM needs to be in the vanguard of those addressing the primary issues of our times that cry for global cooperation, rather than become a platform for venting bilateral grievances between members. Akbaruddin did not name Pakistan but his comments were aimed at Islamabad raising the issue of Kashmir at the multi-lateral forum.  NAM was established in Belgrade in 1961 and was a joint initiative of former Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito."
