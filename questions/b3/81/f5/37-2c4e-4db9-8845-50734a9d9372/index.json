  "answer": "Cuba",
  "explanation": "Guantanamo is a bay located in the Guantanamo province at the southern end of Cuba, facing the Caribbean Sea. The province has the only land border with the USA at the US Navy Base at Guantanamo Bay. Under the 1903 Lease Agreement, the USA assumed territorial control over the southern portion of the Guantanamo Bay thereby the USA exercises jurisdiction and control over the territory while recognizing that Cuba retains ultimate sovereignty. In 1959, the then newly formed Communist Cuban Government declared the presence of the USA in the bay as illegal and called the agreement void. This bay is home to the USA Guantanamo Naval Base and Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp."
