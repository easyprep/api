  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Only 3 is correct",
  "option4": "All are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe provisions for anti-defection was by the 52<sup>nd</sup> constitutional amendment act which was passed in 1985. This added the tenth schedule into the constitution. It lists the process for disqualifying legislators on grounds of defection. The final decision on the matter is by the house’s presiding officer.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe anti-defection law does not provide for considering pre-poll electoral fronts as political parties. However, the Law Commission in its 170<sup>th</sup> report recommended the consideration of such fronts as political parties under this law. The other recommendations were removal of exemption of splits and mergers and to limit the issuance of whips.\n<strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong>\nThe Dinesh Goswami committee was constituted to report on electoral reforms. The committee recommended the limiting of disqualification to cases where members voluntarily give up a party’s membership and when a member votes contrary to the party directive (in case of no confidence motion). The report also called for limiting the disqualification to members who abstain from voting during vote of confidence, in contrary to the party whip."
