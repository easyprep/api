  "explanation": "Bijak, Sakhi Granth, Kabir Granthawali and Anurag Sagar are composiitons of Kabir (1398-1518), who was a mystic poet and saint whose poetry greatly influenced the Bhakti movement. He was a disciple of Ramananda. He is seen as one who balanced the life of a householder, a mystic and a tradesman. The hallmark of Kabirâ€™s works consists of his two line couplets (Doha), which reflect his deep philosophical thinking. Sahitya Lahiri and Sursagar and compositions of Surdas. Vinaya Patrika was written by Tulsidas."
