  "option1": "Only 2, 3, 4 & 5",
  "option2": "Only 3, 4, 5",
  "option3": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "option4": "Only 3 & 4",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3 & 4",
  "explanation": "<ol>\r\n<li>The wavelength of X-rays is of the order of 1Å, whereas wavelength of ?-rays is of the order of 10–3Å.</li>\r\n<li>X-rays are less penetrating than ?-rays.</li>\r\n<li>Both are electromagnetic waves.</li>\r\n<li>Both travel with the speed of 3 × 108 ms–1.</li>\r\n</ol>"
