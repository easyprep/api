  "option1": "Germany",
  "option2": "Belgium",
  "option3": "Netherlands",
  "option4": "France",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Germany",
  "explanation": "Germany houses the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Roman Monuments, Cathedral of St.Peter and Church of Our Lady in Trier\". Trier, which is located on the Moselle river in the West of Germany, was a Roman colony from the 1st century A.D. and then a great trading centre at the beginning of the next century. It became one of the capitals of the Tetrarchy at the end of the 3rd century when it was known as the 'second Rome'. The number and quality of the surviving monuments are an outstanding testimony to Roman civilization. There is no place north of the Alps where so many important Roman buildings and such a concentration of traces of Roman settlement have been preserved as in Trier, the “Rome of the North”. In late classical times, Trier was one of the largest cities in the Roman Empire; it was the seat of the prefects of Gaul, Germania, Britannia and Hispania and after the imperial reforms of Emperor Diocletian was the seat of the vice-emperor (Caesar) of the Western Empire."
