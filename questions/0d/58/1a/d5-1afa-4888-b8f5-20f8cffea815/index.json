  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The phenomenal growth in agricultural production has been called Green Revolution. It was made possible with the introduction of new hybrid seeds and chemical fertilizers. <br />However, the benefits of green revolution have been confined largely to the areas with developed agricultural infrastructure. Also although the technology was not scale-specific, the richer farmers with larger holdings have got benefitted to a greater extent. Due to this fact the green revolution is blamed for increasing the inter-regional and<br />inter-personal economic disparities. <br />Another problem with green revolution has been that many targeted areas shifted a large share of land to cash crops for export rather than the food crops for domestic use."
