  "question": "In light of the recent discussions about ‘forest dieback’ phenomenon, consider the following statements:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Forest dieback phenomenon affects the peripheral regions of the forests.</li>\r\n<li>It converts forests from net carbon sinks to net carbon sources.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong> Forest dieback which is also called Waldsterben is the process by which the woody trees of a forest starts to deteriorate due to various reasons like climate change, pest attack, diseases, etc. This is an episodic event that begins from periphery and proceeds inwards in many cases. <br /><strong>Statement 2 is correct: </strong> The forest dieback phenomenon can convert forests from being a net carbon sink to net carbon source. The dead trees cause rapid loss of carbon back to the atmosphere. Eg: damages to the forest systems of Canada converted the boreal and temperate forests into carbon sources."
