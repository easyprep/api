  "option1": "Henri Falcon",
  "option2": "Hugo Chavez",
  "option3": "Javier Bertucci",
  "option4": "Nicolas Maduro",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Nicolas Maduro",
  "explanation": "Nicolas Maduro Moro, the leftist leader and Venezuela\\'s President, has been re-elected to a second six-year term. Maduro hailed his win as a victory against imperialism, but his rival candidates have rejected the electoral process and called for new elections. The vote was marked by low turnout. Meanwhile, the United States, European Union and several of Venezuela\\'s Latin American neighbours said they would not recognize the results of the election, saying the conditions did not exist for a free and fair poll. Reeling from a 5th year of recession, falling oil production and U.S. sanctions, Venezuela is seeing growing levels of malnutrition and hyperinflation, and mass emigration."
