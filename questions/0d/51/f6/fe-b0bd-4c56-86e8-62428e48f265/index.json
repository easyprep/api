The e-Office solution enables core operations of the Government at all levels to be performed in a 'paper-less' environment, including the E-leave,E-tour,Knowledge Management, Notice Board, Download Forms, Inventory Control etc. In the MDWS, the entire e-office suite was implemented in December 2014 and since then it is being used by all stake holders in the Ministry. All the files in the Ministry are e-files and these have been successfully handled though this system for over 3 years now, when the transition to electronic mode first took place.",
