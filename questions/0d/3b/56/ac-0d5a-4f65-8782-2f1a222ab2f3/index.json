  "question": "With regards to the recent move by India to curb oil imports, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>India has moved Crude Palm Oil (CPO) from ‘free’ to ‘restricted’ list of imports.</li>\n<li>The import of RBD palm oil is restricted only from Malaysia.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe crude palm oil or CPO can be imported freely. The government has imposed restrictions only on the refined version of the palm oil. All goods, except those that can be imported by state owned organisations like FSSAI or those that are restricted or prohibited, can be traded freely in the country.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe government has imposed restrictions but has not banned the import of RBD palm oil. This is applicable to imports from all countries- not only Malaysia. RBD oil is one that has been refined, bleached and deodorised to neutralise the acids, filter out undesired substances and prevent color change upon repeated reuse of the crude palm oil."
