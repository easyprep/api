  "answer": "Ecuador",
  "explanation": "Cayambe Coca Ecological Reserve is an IUCN category II national park located in Ecuador along the line of the equator. The park includes two very different regions of Ecuador, the high altitude sierra with Cayambe volcano and the hot, humid rainforest of the Amazon basin as well as the intervening temperate cloud forest. San Rafael Falls, once the highest waterfall in the country, is located in this reserve. Large birds such as the Andean condor and variable hawk are commonplace in the skies above the reserve. There are indigenous communities living within the protected area such as the Quechua people of Oyacachi in the Napo Province and the Cofán people of Sinangoé in the Sucumbíos Province."
