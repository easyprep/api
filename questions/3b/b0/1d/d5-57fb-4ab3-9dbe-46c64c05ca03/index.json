  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe Manipur black rice is also known as the Chakhao Amubi. It is indigenous and unique to the state. It is especially consumed during the festive season. Due to incessant rains, flash floods and insufficient irrigation during dry spell, the state is facing a shortage and drastic price rises.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe rice variety is known for its health benefits.

In the hilly region, the farmers cultivate it without the use of fertilizers in an organic manner."
