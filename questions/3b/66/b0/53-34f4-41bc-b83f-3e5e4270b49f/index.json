  "question": "The German parliament has classified which of the following North African states as safe countries of origin?",
  "option1": "Algeria",
  "option2": "Tunisia",
  "option3": "Morocco",
  "option4": "All of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "All of the above",
  "explanation": "The German parliament has recently adopted a draft law that classifies the North African states of Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco as well as Georgia as safe countries of origin. The move is meant to deter migrants from those countries and streamline the handling of asylum applications. Once the law is approved by the German Federal Council, asylum procedures for people arriving from these countries will be accelerated.   The return procedure of rejected applicants to their home country will also be sped up. According to the German constitution, safe countries of origin are countries in which there is neither political persecution nor inhuman or degrading punishment and treatment. The law has yet to be approved by the German Federal Council."
