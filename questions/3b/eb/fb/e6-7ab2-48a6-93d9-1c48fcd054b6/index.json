  "question": "In an electronic watch, which of the following is the component corresponding to pendulum of a pendulum clock?",
  "option1": "Transistor",
  "option2": "crystal oscillator",
  "option3": "diode",
  "option4": "balance wheel",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "crystal oscillator",
  "explanation": "A <em>crystal oscillator</em> is an <em>electronic</em> oscillator circuit that uses the mechanical resonance of a vibrating crystal of piezoelectric material to create an electrical signal with a precise frequency. This frequency is often used to keep track of time, as in quartz wristwatches, to provide a stable <em>clock</em> signal for <em>digital</em> watches."
