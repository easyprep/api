  "answer": "Delhi University",
  "explanation": "A team of scientists from Delhi University (DU)  and the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), in collaboration with researchers from Indonesia and the US, have discovered a new species of ‘paddy frog’ from Northeast India, primarily Assam. The frog belongs to the microhylid genus Micryletta. It is a group of narrow-mouthed frogs that is primarily and widely distributed in Southeast Asia. Currently, there are only four recognized species in this group.  The newly discovered Micryletta frog from Northeast India was confirmed as a new species by detailed comparison of both DNA and morphology with all previously known members across Southeast and East Asia. The new species has been named ‘aishani’, derived from the Sanskrit word ‘aishani’ or aisani (meaning North - east), referring to the Northeast regions of India where this frog was discovered. The frog has reddish-brown coloration on the back, prominent dark streaks and ash-grey mottling on the lateral sides, shape of snout and no web on its feet."
