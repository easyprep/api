  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "Most of the great deserts lie between 40Â° and 60Â° north or south latitude. This is because of the prevailing winds in this regions. In the temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere, the westerm edges of continents tend to be warmer than the eastern edges. The major circulation pattern in the atmosphere is an west-to-east; there is very little north or south movement of air. Geological features help determine the location of biomes occur where."
