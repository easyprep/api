  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "The Ozone lies at an altitude between 30 km and 60 km from the earth’s surface. It spans the stratosphere and lower mesosphere. This layer reflects the harmful ultraviolet radiation. The Ozone layer or the ozonosphere is also called chemosphere because a lot of chemical activity takes place here. The temperature rises at a rate of 5 degree celsius per kilometer through this layer."
