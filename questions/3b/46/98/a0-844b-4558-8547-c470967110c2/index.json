  "option1": "It converts UV radiations into electrical energy",
  "option2": "It protects the earth’s life forms by preventing the damaging UV radiations from reaching earth’s surface",
  "option3": "It is of uniform thickness",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "It protects the earth’s life forms by preventing the damaging UV radiations from reaching earth’s surface",
  "explanation": "The ozone layer or ozone shield is a region of Earth\\'s stratosphere that absorbs most of the Sun\\'s ultraviolet radiation. It contains high concentration of ozone in relation to other parts of the atmosphere, although still small in relation to other gases in the stratosphere. The amount of ozone above a location on the Earth varies naturally with latitude, season, and from day-to-day. Under normal circumstances, the ozone layer is thickest over the poles and thinnest around the equator."
