  "question": "&nbsp; &nbsp;Consider the following: <ol> <li>Vacuoles</li> <li>Chloroplasts</li> <li>Cell wall</li> </ol> &nbsp; Which of the above can be found in plant as well as animal cells?",
  "option1": "1 Only",
  "option2": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option3": "1 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1 Only",
  "explanation": "Chloroplasts are tiny structures in plant cells where photosynthesis happens. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll, a green pigment that absorbs light energy for&nbsp;photosynthesis. However, chloroplasts are not found in all plant cells. For example, they are not found in&nbsp;root hair cells. Both plant and animal cells have have&nbsp;vacuoles. Cell walls made of cellulose are only found around plant cells and a few other organisms but not around animal cells.&nbsp;Chloroplasts&nbsp;are the food producers of the&nbsp;cell. The organelles are only found in plant&nbsp;cells&nbsp;and some protists such as algae.&nbsp;Animal cells&nbsp;do not have&nbsp;chloroplasts.&nbsp;"
