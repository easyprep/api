  "question": "With reference to the Flexible Mechanisms of Kyoto Protocol, which of the following is / are correct statements? \r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Through Clean Development Mechanism(CDM),any Annex I country can invest in emission reduction projects in any other Annex I country as an alternative to reducing emissions domestically. </li>\r\n<li>Through Joint Implementation(JI),countries can meet their domestic emission reduction targets by buying greenhouse gas reduction units from (projects in) non Annex I countries to the Kyoto protocol (mostly developing countries). </li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 and 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "The ‘flexible mechanisms’ of the Kyoto Protocol were included for the first time in the COP-6, held Bonn, Germany. Flexible mechanisms or Kyoto Mechanisms, refer to Emissions Trading, the Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation.\r\n1.Emissions trading (ET)-The Emissions Trading-mechanism allows parties to the Kyoto Protocol to buy ‘Kyoto units\\'(emission permits for greenhouse gas) from other countries to help meet their domestic emission reduction targets.\r\n2.Joint Implementation (JI)-Through the Joint Implementation, any Annex I country can invest in emission reduction projects (referred to as “Joint Implementation Projects”) in any other Annex I country as an alternative to reducing emissions domestically.\r\n3.Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)-Through the CDM, countries can meet their domestic emission reduction targets by buying greenhouse gas reduction units from (projects in) non Annex I countries to the Kyoto protocol(mostly developing countries). Non-Annex I countries have no GHG emission restrictions, but have financial incentives to develop GHG emission reduction projects to receive Certified Emission Reductions that can then be sold to Annex I countries, encouraging sustainable development."
