  "question": "With respect to Indiaâ€™s decision to reduce its import dependence for its fossil fuel supply, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Coal gasification produces synthesis gas.</li>\n<li>Most of the coal in India was formed during Carboniferous period.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong>\nThe coal gasification converts coal into synthesis gas/ syngas. This is a mixture of hydrogen, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. It has versatile application and can be produced even from low grade coal. The government is set to use it at the Talcher Plant in Odisha.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong>\nMost of the coal in India is Gondwana coal. This has low carbon content. High grade coal was produced during the Carboniferous period in regions like the Ruhr coal deposits. While the carboniferous coal was produced 350 million years ago, the coal in India was produced 250 million years ago."
