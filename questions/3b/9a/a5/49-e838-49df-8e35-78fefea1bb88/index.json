  "answer": "Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India Ltd.",
  "explanation": "TRIFED is Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India Limited (TRIFED). It was established in August 1987 by the then Ministry of Welfare, Government of India, under the Multi State Cooperative Societies Act 1984 (which has now been replaced by the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act, 2002).\r\nThe core objective was institutionalizing the trade of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) and Surplus Agriculture Produce (SAP) collected/cultivated by tribals as tribals are heavily dependent on these natural products for their livelihood. However, they did not use to get remunerative prices due to middle-men and unscrupulous traders exploiting the naivet√© of Tribals. TRIFED also works as an agency to the FCI for procurement of Wheat and Rice."
