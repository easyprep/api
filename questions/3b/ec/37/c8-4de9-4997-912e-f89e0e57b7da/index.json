  "answer": "Mankidia",
  "explanation": "The Mankidia tribe has been recognised as one of the 13 particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs) in the State. They are known for collection of Siali fibre, from which they build small huts and offer worship to their deities. This tribal group was in news for filing a claim for habitat rights in the Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR). However, their claim was recently denied since the Forest Department thought that the indigenous people might face life threat from wildlife or even come in way of their free movement due to grant of habitat rights in the Tiger Reserve."
