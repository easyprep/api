  "option2": "2, 3 & 4",
  "option3": "3 & 4",
  "option4": "Only 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "3 & 4",
  "explanation": "First statement is incorrect. Tilak has famously opposed the Age of Consent Bill which had raised the age limit for marriage of girls from 10 to 12 years. It is true that he was a reactionary and did not use his influence to help the social reformers, largely because he did not want to offend the rigid social system. Second statement is incorrect: Bal Gangadhar Tilak was the first intellectual leader to understand the importance of mass support and was the first true mass leader of India. He had realized that constitutional agitation against British was futile. But he also realized that India was ill prepared for an armed revolt. This was the reason that he did not jump into the revolutionary activities like Savarkar and Chapekar brothers. Third statement and Fourth statements are correct and notable facts about his life."
