  "explanation": "In September 1923 the government announced a levy of Rs 2.5 lakhs on the residents of Borsad taluka as its expense on special anti-dacoity police posted there: each person over 16 years of age was to pay two rupees and seven annas towards the sum. Sardar Patel and his colleagues uncovered evidence of the police being in cahoots with the dacoits; and that the villagers who had shown exemplary courage in resisting the dacoits or in informing the police were severely victimised. Sardar Patel and his team organised the villagers for agitation against the levied tax. After a protracted struggle, which Sardar had organized superbly, the government was forced to give in."
