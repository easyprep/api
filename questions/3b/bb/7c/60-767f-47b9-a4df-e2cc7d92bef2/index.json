  "explanation": "Forests formally contribute 1.7 percent to IndiaÂ¿s GDP. India produces a range of processed forest (wood and non-wood) products ranging from sawnwood, panel products and wood pulp to bamboo, rattan ware and pine resin. The paper industry produces over 3 million tonnes annually from more than 400 mills (however, the raw material to produce that volume comes substantially from non-wood fibre)."
