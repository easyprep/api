  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "The Pitts India act made the company&nbsp;directly subordinate to the British government.&nbsp;Pitt&rsquo;s India Act 1784 or the&nbsp;East India Company Act 1784&nbsp;was passed in the British Parliament to rectify the defects of the Regulating Act 1773. It resulted in&nbsp;dual control or joint government&nbsp;in India by Crown in Great Britain and the British East India Company, with crown having ultimate authority. With this act, East India Company&rsquo;s&nbsp;political functions were differentiated from its commercial activities for the first time. The relationship between company and crown established by this act kept changing with time until the Government of India Act 1858 provided for liquidation of the British East India Company."
