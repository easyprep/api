  "question": "With reference to various properties of X-Rays, which among the following statements is / are correct?<br> 1.The Hard X-Rays have a shorter wavelength than the Soft X-Rays<br> 2.The X-Rays are deflected by the Electric Field, but are not deflected by the Magnetic Field<br> 3.X-Rays don&#8217;t show many properties of light such as Refraction, diffraction, Interference and Polarization<br> Choose the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "Only 1",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "The first statement is correct. The wavelength of X-Rays is from 0 Å to 250Å. The Hard X-rays have a wavelength of less than 10Å while the soft X-Rays have the wavelength of more than 10Å. The second statement is incorrect because Both Electric and Magnetic fields don&#8217;t affect X-Rays. The Third statement is incorrect because X-Rays show most properties of light."
