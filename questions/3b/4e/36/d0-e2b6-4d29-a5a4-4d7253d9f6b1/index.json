  "explanation": "On October 25, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has launched its largest military exercise “Trident Juncture 2018” since the cold war in Norway in a hypothetical scenario that involves restoring the Scandinavian country\\'s sovereignty after an attack by a \\\"fictitious aggressor”. The exercise is designed to test NATO’s ability to plan and conduct a major collective defense operation — from troop training at the tactical level, to command large elements of a NATO force. The wargames bring together around 50,000 personnel from all 29 NATO allies, plus partners Finland and Sweden. Around 65 vessels, 150 aircraft and 10,000 vehicles will also participate in the drill, which takes place in central and eastern Norway, the North Atlantic and the Baltic Sea. It will go on till November 7."
