  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "Adipose tissue is a connective tissue modified for storage of fat. The cells are generally large, and are rounded or oval in shape with prominent central vacuoles that push the cytoplasm and the nuclei to the periphery of the cells. Adipose tissue is found between the internal organs and below the skin. The yellow bone marrow is also an example of adipose tissue. adipose tissue has, in recent years, been recognized as a major endocrine organ, as it produces hormones such as leptin, estrogen, resistin, and the cytokine TNF?. In humans, adipose tissue is located beneath the skin (subcutaneous fat), around internal organs (visceral fat), in bone marrow (yellow bone marrow) and in the breast tissue."
