  "question": "In which census was the term Urban Agglomeration introduced?",
  "option1": 1981,
  "option2": 1951,
  "option3": 2001,
  "option4": 1971,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 1971,
  "explanation": "Urban Agglomeration - This term was introduced in 1971 census. Very often large railway colonies, university campuses, port areas, military camps etc. come up outside the statutory limits of the city or town but adjoining it. Such areas may not themselves qualify to be treated as towns but if they form a continuous spread with the adjoining town, it would be realistic to treat them as urban. Such settlement has been termed as outgrowths, and may cover a whole village, or part of a village. Such towns together with their outgrowths have been treated as one urban unit and called ‘urban agglomeration’."
