  "explanation": "UPSC is keen on such species information, especially when they are appearing continuously in news. All these turtle names and related news and discussions were in the news paper in the previous months. The key information is as follows: <strong>Northern River Terrapin</strong> It is a species of riverine turtle native to Southeast Asia. In India it is found in West Bengal and Odisha, but the numbers declined drastically. It is found in tidal areas of large rivers, sandbars and riverbanks. <ul> <li>IUCN status-Critically Endangered</li> <li>It has been listed on <em>Schedule</em> - I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, <em>1972 and</em> Included on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), making international trade in this species illegal</li> </ul> <strong>Olive Ridley Turtle</strong> <strong>Olive ridley turtle </strong>is a sea turtle found in warm and tropical waters, primarily in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. They can also be found in warm waters of Atlantic Ocean. <ul> <li>IUCN status- Vulnerable; It has been listed on <em>Schedule</em> - I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, <em>1972 </em><em>and </em>Included on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).</li> </ul> Nesting sites on Indian coastal areas: Odisha coast especially in Gahirmatha beach and Rushikulaya coast; Sacramento Island, Hope Island &amp; Uppada (Ellaiapet) in Andhra Pradesh. These turtles are known for its mass nesting called ‘Arribada’, where thousands of females come together on the same beach to lay eggs. These turtles spend their entire lives in the ocean, and migrate thousands of kilometers between feeding and mating grounds in the course of a year.  <strong>Indian Star Tortoise</strong> It is found in dry areas and scrub forest in India , Pakistan and Sri Lanka. i.e. three discrete portions of the Indian subcontinent: the first is in western India and extreme south eastern Pakistan (e.g., Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh in India and the Thar Desert in Pakistan), the second is in south eastern India (Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu), the third is on the island of Sri Lanka.  Recently Chinnar wildlife sanctuary (CWS) in Kerala made a debut in rehabilitation of star tortoises. This makes the CWS the only rehabilitation centre for star tortoises in the country. <ul> <li>IUCN status- Vulnerable</li> <li>It has been listed on <em>Schedule</em> - IV of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, <em>1972 </em></li> </ul> Included on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) that regulates all commercial trade."
