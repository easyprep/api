  "question": "Which of these statements is correct about the energy of a satellite:",
  "option1": "Potential energy= – 2 (Kinetic energy)",
  "option2": "Potential energy= 2 (Kinetic energy)",
  "option3": "Potential energy= – 3 (Kinetic energy)",
  "option4": "Potential energy= - (Kinetic energy)",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Potential energy= – 2 (Kinetic energy)",
  "explanation": "Potential energy of a satellite: -L<sup>2</sup>/mr<sup>2</sup> Potential energy of a satellite: -L<sup>2</sup>/2mr<sup>2</sup> Therefore, Potential energy= – 2 (Kinetic energy)"
