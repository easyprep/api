  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Shola Grassland",
  "explanation": "Shola forests are tropical montane forests predominantly found in the hilly regions of Western Ghats. Recently, researchers from Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE) in collaboration with IISER in Tirupati and Botanical Survey of India used satellite imagery to study the forest and grassland cover in the Western Ghats. They found that there has been a drastic decline in the area of the Shola grassland. In the place of these grasslands and forests, timber plantations have thrived. Also, increase in agricultural land coupled by urbanisation was reported as another major reason for decline of shola grasslands."
