  "question": "Which of the following is / are correct observations about weathering?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Exposure of rock to the changes in temperature causes chemical weathering</li>\r\n<li>Lichens and mosses are agents of physical as well as chemical weathering</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "<p class=\\\"Notes\\\">Physical Weathering can be caused by thermal changes, Frost Action, Pressure Release, Hydraulic action and Haloclasty. Biological Weathering refers to the contribution made by the organisms such as Lichens and mosses, which grow on essentially bare rock surfaces and create a more humid chemical microenvironment. Biological weathering is both physical as well as chemical breakdown of the surface micro layer of the rock. The animals such as earthworms and other annelids, moles, rabbits all contribute to the biological weathering."
