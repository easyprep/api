  "question": "The product of two numbers is 2028 and their HCF is 13. The number of such pairs is :",
  "option1": 1,
  "option2": 2,
  "option3": 3,
  "option4": 4,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 2,
  "explanation": "Here, HCF = 13\r\nLet the numbers be 13x and 13y, where x and y are prime to each other. \r\nNow, 13x $latex \\\\times$ 13y = 2028\r\n$latex => xy = \\\\frac{2028}{13\\\\times 13} = 12&s=1$\r\nThe opposite pairs are : (1, 12), (3, 4), (2, 6)\r\nBut the 2 and 6 are not co-prime. \r\nSo, required no. of pairs = 2\r\nHence option [B] is correct answer."
