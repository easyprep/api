  "question": "With reference to the Ocean Currents in Indian Ocean consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Indian Ocean is known for one of the most consistent system of Ocean Currents</li>\r\n<li>The currents in the northern Indian Ocean change their flow direction twice a year</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "The current systems of the Indian Ocean are largely controlled and modified by landmasses and monsoon winds. Indian Ocean being surrounded by the Indian subcontinent, Africa and Australia does not present most favourable conditions for the development of consistent system of ocean currents. The currents in the northern Indian Ocean change their flow direction twice a year due to north-east and south-west monsoon winds."
