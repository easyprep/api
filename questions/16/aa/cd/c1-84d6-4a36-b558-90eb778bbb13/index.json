  "question": "In context with the ‘reproductive failure’ revealed by studies in the Arctic, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>This phenomenon is affecting only the animals and not the plants.</li>\n<li>Arctic Fox is one of the affected animals.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe reproductive failure was observed among both plants and animals by the study published in PLOS Biology journal. Such failure at all levels of the ecosystem is being observed for the first time. This because, the animals and plants become unable to reproduce because of extreme climate changes.\n<strong>Statement 2 is correct:        </strong>\nThe Artic Foxes are one of the affected species. These foxes are known for their camouflaging abilities where they turn white during winters and a warmer shade in the summers. The researchers reported no cubs this season. The other affected species include muskfox, tundra vegetation, etc."
