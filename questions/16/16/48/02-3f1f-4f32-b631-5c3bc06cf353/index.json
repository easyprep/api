  "answer": "Only 1, 2 & 3",
  "explanation": "From 2004-05 till 2013-14, the Oil Seeds, Pulses and Maize were included in Integrated Scheme of Oilseeds, Pulses, Oil Palm and Maize (ISOPOM) programme. In 2014-15, Pulses and Maize were moved to National Food Security Mission while a different mission National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP) including Tree Borne Oilseeds (TBOs) was launched. Thus, oil seeds are not under NFSM as of now. NFSM has five components viz. (a) NFSM – Rice (b) NFSM – Wheat (c) NFSM – Pulses (d) NFSM – Coarse Cereals and (e) NFSM – Commercial Crops (NFSM – CC)"
