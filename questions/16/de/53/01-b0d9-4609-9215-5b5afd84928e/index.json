  "question": "What term is used for a gene that exhibits multiple effects?",
  "option1": "Pleiotropism",
  "option2": "Multitropism",
  "option3": "Complementary",
  "option4": "Allele",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Pleiotropism",
  "explanation": "Pleiotropism describes the genetic effect of a single gene on multiple phenotypic traits. A classic example of pleiotropy is phenylketonuria, a human disease that affects multiple systems but is caused by one gene defect. The underlying mechanism is that the gene codes for a product that is, for example, used by various cells, or has a signaling function on various targets."
