  "answer": "Xiaodong Sheng",
  "explanation": "In the men single\\'s final, India\\'s Kaushal Dharmamer, fought hard but eventually lost to fifth seed Xiaodong Sheng from Canada 19-21, 21-8, 14-21. Dharmamer took the second game with utmost ease at 21 -18 and it seemed he had the upper hand after losing the first one. The Mumbai-lad was ahead in the third game 12-10, but Sheng won seven points in a row to tilt the contest in his favour and it was then rather difficult for Dharmamer to make a comeback. The top-seeded India pair of Manu Attri and Sumeeth Reddy were crowned doubles champions in the Infosys Foundation-India International Challenge."
