It stands for Quasi Zenith Satellite System and is composed of 4 satellites. It is one of the allied navigational satellite systems of USA.\n<strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:   </strong>\nGLONASS is a non- allied navigational satellite system of USA under its National Defense Authorisation Act. This means that USA will not cooperate nor exchange information with the Russian satellite system. China’s navigational satellite system Beidou is also under this category."
