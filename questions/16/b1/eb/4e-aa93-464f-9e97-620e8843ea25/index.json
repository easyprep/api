  "question": "The \"Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve\" is located in which country?",
  "option1": "Cameroon",
  "option2": "Laos",
  "option3": "Ecuador",
  "option4": "New Zealand",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Ecuador",
  "explanation": "Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve is located in the Sucumbios and Orellana provinces of Ecuador. This wildlife reserve is the second-largest reserve of Ecuador. It was established in 1979 as per the recommendations of the Food and Agricultural Organisation report on the \"National Strategy on the Conservation of Outstanding Wild Areas of Ecuador\". The Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve is an important nature reserve in Amazonia with rather unusual ecological characteristics. Located at the foothills of the Andes, it is different from any other Amazon protected area in the world. The area encompasses a poorly drained plain with a network of periodically inundated forests, lakes and creeks. Such conditions are rare so close to the Andes, where the drainage in the foothills prevents the development of swamps and lakes. Given its proximity to the mountains, combined with a slightly cooler and wetter climate it may be expected to have a partly different species composition than other areas in the upper Amazon watershed. As all protected areas in the Amazon region, the area has high biodiversity, but possibly a bit lower than better drained protected areas like the neighbouring Yasuni National Park, which is considered the most diverse park in the world."
