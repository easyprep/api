  "question": "Consider the following structures: <ol> <li>Hawaiian Islands</li> <li>Himalayas</li> <li>Red Sea Rift</li> </ol> Which of the above is/are example(s) of continent-continent convergent plate boundaries?",
  "option1": "1 & 3 Only",
  "option2": "2 Only",
  "option3": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "2 Only",
  "explanation": "Continental plates are buoyant (floating in nature) and hence, difficult to sub duct one beneath another. If the two plates that meet at a convergent plate boundary such that both consist of continental crust, they will smash together and push upwards to create mountains. Mid Oceanic Ridge is an example of divergent plate boundaries. The Red Sea Rift was formed by the divergence between the African Plate and the Arabian Plate.&nbsp;Hawaiian Islands are result of convergent plate boundaries where oceanic tectonic plate gets sub ducted&nbsp;beneath another oceanic&nbsp;tectonic plate. &nbsp;"
