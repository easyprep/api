  "question": "Angle of friction is _______:",
  "option1": "equal to angle of repose",
  "option2": "equal to twice the angle of repose",
  "option3": "is greater than the angle of repose",
  "option4": "is less than the angle of repose",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "equal to angle of repose",
  "explanation": "Angle of friction is equal to angle of repose. Angle of repose is the angle that the plane of contact between two bodies makes with the horizontal when the upper body is just on the point of sliding."
