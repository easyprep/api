  "question": "Which of the following is / are correct statements about Inert Gases? \r\n<ol>\r\n<li>They have zero valency </li>\r\n<li>They don’t undergo chemical reactions </li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "Inert gases (helium, neon, argon, krypton) have zero valency because their octet is complete. So, they neither lose nor gain electrons. These elements are unable to undergo any chemical reaction as they have eight electrons (except helium) in their outermost shell having stable electronic configuration following the octet rule."
