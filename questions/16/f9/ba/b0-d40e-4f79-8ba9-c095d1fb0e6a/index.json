  "question": "Recently, the largest warships of which of the following countries were making news for their first time visit to Sri Lanka under the so called “Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy\"?",
  "option1": "China",
  "option2": "Japan",
  "option3": "United States",
  "option4": "South Korea",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Japan",
  "explanation": "The term “Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy” has been introduced by Japan as a part of its foreign policy. It rests on “two oceans” — Indian and Pacific — and “two continents” — Africa and Asia. The strategy aims to prepare Japan to deal with the fast changing global and regional order and threats from China and North Korea. With this new strategy, Japan tries to intensify its focus on the Indo-Pacific region. This strategy will help Japan to build peace pro-actively, based on “diplomacy that takes a panoramic view of the world map”. The strategy also involves connecting “free and open” Asia-Pacific region with parts of eastern Africa, south Asia and Southeast Asia with the western Pacific Ocean region and Japan."
