  "question": "The researchers at which IIT has developed Hydro Thermal Carbonization (HTC) technology for solid waste management?",
  "option1": "IIT Kanpur",
  "option2": "IIT Kharagpur",
  "option3": "IIT Madras",
  "option4": "IIT Delhi",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "IIT Kharagpur",
  "explanation": "A research team at IIT Kharagpur has developed a technology which can generate energy from solid waste with high moisture content. The new technology - Hydro Thermal Carbonization (HTC) - can convert municipal solid waste to biofuel, soil amendment and absorbents. The technology converts organic fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) into Hydrochar by using a batch reactor. The moisture in the waste is used to the advantage of the process which uses water for the reaction. The process has increased the resource recovery yield to 50-65% of urban organic waste. The key to the success of the technology lies in designing a proper industrial-scale HTC reactor with improved heat integration system."
