  "question": "Which of the following represents ideal gas law?",
  "option1": "PVT = constant",
  "option2": "PT/V = constant",
  "option3": "PV/T = constant",
  "option4": "VT/P = constant",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "PV/T = constant",
  "explanation": "Since PV = constant and V/T = constant for a given quantity of gas, then PV/T should also be a constant. This relationship is known as ideal gas law."
