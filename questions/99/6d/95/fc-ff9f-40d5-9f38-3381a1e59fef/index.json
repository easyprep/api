  "answer": "1, 2, 3 & 4 Only",
  "explanation": "Conservation Reserves, Community Reserves and Wildlife sanctuaries as well as National Parks can be declared by the state government. Whenever it appears to the State Government that an area by reason of its ecological, faunal, floral, geomorphological or zoological importance is needed to be constituted as a National Park for the purpose of protecting, it may, by notification, declare its intention to constitute such area as a National Park. Tiger Reserves are declared by&nbsp;National Tiger Conservation Authority&nbsp;via Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Act, 2006 under centrally sponsored scheme called&nbsp;Project Tiger.&nbsp;To declare an area as Tiger Reserve, the state governments can forward their proposals in this regard to NTCA. Central Government via NTCA may also advise the state governments to forward a proposal for creation of Tiger Reserves. Tiger Reserves are managed by National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA).&nbsp;No alternation of boundary can be done without the recommendation of National Board for Wild Life and without the advice of the Tiger Conservation Authority."
