  "answer": "Meeta Pandit",
  "explanation": "The book \\\"India\\'s Heritage of Gharana Music: Pandits of Gwalior\\\" has been authored by classical vocalist Meeta Pandit. It was recently launched by politicians Jyotiraditya Scindia and Karan Singh. The book is an outcome of an emotional journey that author undertook after her elder brother Tushar Pandit died in a road accident in 1994. According to the book, Akbar\\'s fondness for Tansen troubled the other musicians, who looked for ways to humiliate the musician. The book also documents how the Pandit family assimilated the great music tradition from the Khans -- Ustad Haddu Khan, Ustad Natthu Khan, and Ustad Nissar Hussain Khan -- and sheds light on the gharana style."
