  "question": "Consider the following seismic waves: <ol> <li>Primary waves</li> <li>Secondary waves</li> <li>Rayleigh waves</li> <li>Love waves</li> </ol> Which of the above are surface waves?",
  "option1": "1 & 3 Only",
  "option2": "2 & 3 Only",
  "option3": "3 & 4 Only",
  "option4": "1 & 2 Only",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "3 & 4 Only",
  "explanation": "There are three types of waves generated during an earthquake: P (primary) waves, S (secondary) waves and surface waves. These waves are recorded at seismic recording stations one after another. While both P and S waves penetrate the interior of the Earth and are called body waves, surface waves do not penetrate the interior.&nbsp;The first kind of surface waves is called a&nbsp;Love wave. It&#039;s the fastest surface wave and is confined to the earth&rsquo;s crust and moves only in horizontal direction. The other kind of surface wave is the&nbsp;Rayleigh wave, a Rayleigh wave rolls along the ground just like a wave rolls across a lake or an ocean. Most of the shaking felt from an earthquake is due to the Rayleigh wave, which can be much larger than the other waves."
