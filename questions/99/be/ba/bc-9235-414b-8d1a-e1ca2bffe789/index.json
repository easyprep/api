  "question": "The temperature in Antarctica’s interior regions dips much below in winter in comparison to respective winters in Arctic. Why?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Much of arctic zone is surrounded by relatively warmer ocean water</li>\r\n<li>Much of the sunlight at Antarctic gets reflected back</li>\r\n<li>South pole of earth is at a greater distance from Sun</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct statements from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "North Atlantic drift and Gulf streams accounts for transfer of warm waters over the artic. Also, arctic is surrounded by less snow and large lands which increases the sun’s insolation over the area whereas Antarctic is covered with large snow and maximum reflection of sunlight or large Albedo. Hence cooler than Arctic. Beside this; the air circulation pattern and thin layer of Ozone over Antarctic is also responsible for changed climate pattern."
