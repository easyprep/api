  "explanation": "Kindly note that Raw silk is of two kinds, viz., mulberry and non-mulberry based upon rearing of silk worms either upon mulberry leaves or on other plants. The Non-mulberry silk is also known as “Vanya Silk”.<br />• Majority of the silk produced in entire India is of mulberry type. However, majority of the silk produced in ONLY north east India is of Vanya type.<br />• Mulberry silk is produced mainly in Karnataka, West Bengal, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.<br />• Vanya silk is of further three types in India called Tasar, Eri and Muga.<br />o Tasar Silk is obtained from the cocoons of silkworms which are fed on leaves of Oak, Asan and Arjuna trees. Thus, Oak Tasar is a silk whose silk worm is reared on oak tree. In our country, the Tasar silk is mainly produced in Jharkhand, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal &amp; Andhra Pradesh.<br />o Eri Silk is obtained from the cocoons of the silkworms that are reared on castor leaves. It is produced in Assam, Bihar, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland and West Bengal. The Eri silk can be identified with its natural copperish color.<br />o Muga Silk is produced from the silkworm cocoons that are fed on Som and Soalu plant leaves. Such silk is produced in India mainly in Assam. It can be identified with its rich golden color."
