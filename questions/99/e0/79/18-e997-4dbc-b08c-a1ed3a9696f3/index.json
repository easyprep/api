In this regard consider the following:\n<ol>\n<li>The bill separates the state of J&amp;K into 2 states.</li>\n<li>The newly formed J&amp;K will have a legislative assembly with 83 seats.</li>\n<li>The J&amp;K legislative assembly will be abolished.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements are correct?",
  "option1": "1 and 3",
  "option2": "2 and 3",
  "option3": "1 and 2",
  "option4": "Only 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 3",
  "explanation": "<strong><u>Explanation:</u></strong>\n<strong>Statement 1 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe reorganisation bill after enactment will create 2 union territories out of the J&amp;K state. The Ladakh UT and J&amp;K UT will be the results. The constitution provides the power of creation of states and UT under article 3 to the centre. This does not require the state’s permission, but its opinion may be considered. The state of J&amp;K was protected from centre’s powers by the article 370 and this is about to be abrogated.\n<strong>Statement 2 </strong>is incorrect:\nThe J&amp;K UT to be formed will have a legislative assembly. This assembly will have 107 seats. However, 24 of its seats will be vacant. This is to account for the constituencies that fall under the Pakistan occupied Kashmir/ PoK area. Also, there will be reservation of seats for SC and ST in proportion to their population.\n<strong>Statement 3 </strong>is correct:\nThe bill calls for abolishing the legislative council. It is the upper house of the J&amp;K legislature. It’s also called the J&amp;K Vidhan Parishad. It has 36 seats and the members are not selected by direct election. It has 2 regular sessions and can introduce bills for legislation except money bills. This body will be dissolved by the reorganisation bill."
