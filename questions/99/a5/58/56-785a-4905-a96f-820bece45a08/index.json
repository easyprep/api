  "option2": "Only 1 & 2",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "None",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is correct</u>. The Quit India Movement was launched at the Bombay session of the All-India Congress Committee by Mahatma Gandhi on 8th August, 1942. <u>Second statement is incorrect </u>because Aruna Asaf Ali hoisted the Indian Tricolour in the Gowalia Tank Maidan during the Quit India Movement. <u>Third statement is again incorrect. </u> It is correct that the Muslim League opposed the Quit India Movement on the basis of fact that if the British left India in its current stage, minority Muslims would be oppressed by the majority Hindus. But another important fact to be noted is that Hindu Mahasabha as well as Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh also opposed the Quit India Movement. In fact, they supported British rulers in suppressing this historic mass upsurge. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was running coalition governments in Sindh, Bengal and NWFP during Quit India Movement. Similarly, the Hindu Mahasabha, led by Savarkar, ran coalition governments with the Muslim League in 1942. [75th anniversary was celebrated recently.]"
