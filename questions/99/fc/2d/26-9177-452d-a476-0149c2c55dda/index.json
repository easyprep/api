  "question": "The so called “Red shift” of distant galaxies has been used as an evidence for which of the following?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Expansion of the universe</li>\r\n<li>Existence of Black holes</li>\r\n<li>Existence of Dark Energy</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSelect the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2 & 3",
  "option3": "Only 1 & 3",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 & 3",
  "explanation": "Redshift occurs when light sources move away from the observer. If all the galaxies in the universe are moving away from us, that’s evidence that the universe is expanding. The evidence that black holes exist is their gravitational effects on visible objects near them, not redshift. Redshift—specifically, <u>increasing redshift, has been used as an evidence for <strong>dark energy.</strong></u> <u>On the other hand, </u>anomalous rotation curves in galaxies, not redshift is linked to dark matter."
