  "explanation": "On 2nd January 2019, the Haryana government approved 11 projects for the rejuvenation of the mythical Saraswati river. The purpose of the projects is to revive the ancient Sarasvati river in the state and ensure regular flow of fresh water into it. These include the construction of Somb Saraswati barrage, Saraswati reservoir and Adi Badri dam on Somb river, a tributary of the Yamuna that originates in the Shivalik Hills. The projects were approved at a meeting of the Haryana Saraswati Heritage Development Board (HSHDB) chaired by the chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar.  The board also approved construction of bridges at different locations and a Saraswati ghat. The construction of Somb Saraswati barrage and Saraswati reservoir would enable the storage of 1,000 hectare metres of water. The Haryana plan also involves interlinking of the Markanda river with what is said to be the course of the Saraswati through the Kainthla supply channel."
