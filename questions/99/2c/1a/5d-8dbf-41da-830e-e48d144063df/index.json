  "question": "In which among the following states, Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) was imposed for the first time?",
  "option1": "Manipur",
  "option2": "Punjab",
  "option3": "Jammu & Kashmir",
  "option4": "7 North East States",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "7 North East States",
  "explanation": "AFSPA became a law on September 11, 1958. Initially, it was applicable to the seven Northeastern states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura. This was so because in all these states there were movements of ethnic groups demanding separation from India. The government felt that such insurgencies could be checked through deployment of the armed forces, and they would need special powers to carry out their responsibilities. AFSPA was extended to J&amp;K in 1990, on similar considerations."
