  "option1": "Greece",
  "option2": "Portugal",
  "option3": "South Africa",
  "option4": "Bermuda",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Bermuda",
  "explanation": "Bermuda has become the world\\'s first country to legalise and then repeal same-sex marriage. The governor of the British island territory John Rankin approved a bill reversing the right of gay couples to marry, despite 2017 Supreme Court ruling that authorized same-sex marriage. It is a step towards seeking to balance opposition to same-sex marriage on the socially conservative island while complying with European court rulings that make sure same-sex couples are recognized and protected in the territory."
