  "option3": "Only 2 & 3 are correct",
  "option4": "1, 2 & 3 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Alpine Tundra versus Arctic Tundra<br /></strong>While the Arctic Tundra is located in Polar regions, the Alpine tundra is located on mountains throughout the world at high altitude where trees cannot grow. Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Rift Mountains of Africa (such as Mount Kilimanjaro), and a large portion of the Tibetan Plateau are best examples of Alpine Tundra. The growing season is approximately 180 days. The nighttime temperature is usually below freezing. The major difference between the arctic Tundra and Alpine Tundra is that unlike the arctic tundra, the soil in the alpine is well drained. The Alpine Tundra does not have permafrost. The plants of Alpine Tundra are very similar to those of the arctic ones, however there is a major difference in the fauna of Arctic Tundra and Alpine Tundra. Kea parrot, marmot, mountain goats, chinchilla, woodland caribou, and pika are some of the best known species of Alpine Tundra."
