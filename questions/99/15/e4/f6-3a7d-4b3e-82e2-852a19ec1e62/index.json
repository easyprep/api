  "question": "For how long approximately an image persists on the retina before vanishing?",
  "option1": "1/8 seconds",
  "option2": "1/16 seconds",
  "option3": "1/32 seconds",
  "option4": "1 second",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "1/16 seconds",
  "explanation": "The impression of an image does not vanish immediately from the retina. It persists there for about 1/16th of a second. So, if still images of a moving object are flashed on the eye at a rate faster than 16 per second, then the eye perceives this object as moving."
