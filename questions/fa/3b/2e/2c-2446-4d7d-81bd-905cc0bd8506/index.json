  "option1": 0.1125,
  "option2": 0.1095,
  "option3": 0.1025,
  "option4": 0.0988,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 0.0988,
  "explanation": "The ratio of central taxes -to-GDP fell further in the fiscal year 2019-20 to 9.88 per cent, mostly due to the decline in collection from customs duties and corporation tax.\r\nThis measure is reported to be a ten-year low, as the ratio stood at 10.97 per cent in FY19 and at 11.22 per cent in FY18. Due to the stagnation in economic activity, this indicator is expected to decline further. The gross tax revenue also fell 3.39 per cent in FY20, with a shortfall of Rs 1.5-trillion as compared to the revised Budget target for the year."
