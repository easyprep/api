Johnson has divided the Indian ocean into three zones.\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The Western zone : It is between the African coast and the mid Indian oceanic ridge, and average depth is around 400 m. or 2000 fathoms in this zone.</li>\r\n<li>The Eastern zone : It is deepest with a depth of around 550 m or 3000 fathoms.</li>\r\n<li>The Central zone : It represents the mid oceanic ridge where many tiny island are located</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nDeeps and Trenches : Important deep-Sea trenches are Sunda trench (7450 m deep), o b trench (687.5 m deep). Mauritius trench, Amirante trench etc. The deeps are almost absent."
