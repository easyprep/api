  "question": "The Advanced heavy-water reactor (AHWR) is a key component of the final stage of the three-stage Indian Nuclear program. In this context, what is / are difference(s) between the AHWR and AHWR-LEU?<br> 1. While AHWR uses only Thorium as fuel, AHWR-LEU uses Thorium as well as Uranium<br> 2. While AHWR is intended for domestic use, AHWR-LEU is intended for export<br> Which among the above is / are correct statements?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "AHWR is intended for domestic use and the AHWR-LEU for export. The AHWR is the key component of the final stage of the three-stage Indian Nuclear program, “Thorium Utilization for Sustainable Power Programme,” that has been in development since the 1950’s. The nuclear program in India has historically assumed a heavy reliance on the ultimate transition to a thorium-based fuel cycle due to the abundant domestic thorium resources and the scarcity of domestic uranium.<br> Both the AHWR and AHWR-LEU use thorium-based oxide fuels, with the AHWR using both UO2/ThO2 and PuO2/ThO2 fuels simultaneously, while AHWR-LEU uses only UO2/ThO2 fuel."
