  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because Meldonium is used to increase the blood flow to parts of the body or treatment of ischemia (oxygen deficiency in tissues).<br> <u>Second statement is incorrect</u> because it is manufactured in Latvia&nbsp;and only distributed in Baltic countries and Russia.&nbsp;The drug was making news after <strong>Maria Sharapova (</strong>Russian tennis player<strong>)</strong> was tested positive for&nbsp;the drug, which was banned by World Anti-Doping Agency&rsquo;s on January 1, 2016."
