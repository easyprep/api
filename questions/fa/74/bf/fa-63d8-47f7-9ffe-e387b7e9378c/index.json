  "question": "What happens when leaves of touch-me-not plant are touched? <ol><li>Leaf cells lose sodium ions</li><li>Water leaves the cells via reverse osmosis</li></ol> Select the correct option from the codes given below:",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "The touch-me-not shrinks due to loss of turgidity (the pressure of content against the cell wall) by cells within the pulvini-specialised motor organs at leaf joints. Upon stimulation, like touching, the leaf cells lose potassium ions, triggering water to leave the cells through osmosis. It takes about 10 minutes for the cells to regain turgidity and the leaves to open out."
