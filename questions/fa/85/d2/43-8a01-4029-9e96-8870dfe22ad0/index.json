  "question": "Which of the following elements is used to make the heater element in an electric iron?",
  "option1": "Nichrome",
  "option2": "Tungsten",
  "option3": "Copper",
  "option4": "Iron",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Nichrome",
  "explanation": "In an electric iron, heating element is made up of nichrome. The composition of heating element is 80/20 (80% nickel, 20% chromium). Nichrome 80/20 is an ideal material, because it has relatively high resistance and forms an adherent layer of chromium oxide when it is heated for the first time."
