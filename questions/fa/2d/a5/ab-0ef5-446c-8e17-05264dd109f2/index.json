  "answer": "1 & 2 Only",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is correct</u>. OPCW is an intergovernmental organisation and India is a party to the convention. The members to the Chemical Weapons convention are automatically members of the OPCW. The convention prohibits the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer or use of chemical weapons. It came into force in 1997. In India, NACWC has been established under the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000 for implementing the provisions of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction. National Authority Chemical Weapons Convention (NACWC) is an office under the Cabinet Secretariat and is the nodal agency for the implementation of the provisions of Chemical Weapons Conventions (CWC). <u>Second statement is correct</u>. The organisation received the Nobel peace prize in 2013. <u>Third statement is incorrect</u> because though the Director-General is directly appointed by the Conference not for a term of 5 year but for a maximum of two four-year terms."
