  "question": "With reference to metamorphic rocks, consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Metamorphic rocks may develop from igneous as well as sedimentary rocks</li>\r\n<li>Metamorphic rocks are typically found in regions of orogeny</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Both 1 & 2",
  "explanation": "<p class=\\\"Notes\\\">Metamorphic rocks once existed as igneous or sedimentary rocks but have been subjected to varying degrees of pressure and heat within the Earthâ€™s crust. The processes involved changes the composition and fabric of the rock and their original nature is often hard to distinguish. Metamorphic rocks are typically found in areas of mountain building. Thus, both statements are correct."
