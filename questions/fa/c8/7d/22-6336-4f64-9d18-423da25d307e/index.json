  "question": "Consider the following comparisons of the Continental islands and Oceanic Islands?\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Continental Islands lie on the continental shelf; Oceanic Islands are accumulations of sand deposited by sea currents</li>\r\n<li>Continental Islands are affected by maximum plate tectonics; Oceanic Islands are affected by minimum plate tectonics</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above comparisons is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "Continental islands are bodies of land that lie on the continental shelf of a continent. Oceanic islands are ones that do not sit on continental shelves. Examples of Continental Islands are Greenland, Long Island, and Sable Island off North America; Barbados and Trinidad off South America; Great Britain, Ireland and Sicily off Europe; Sumatra, Borneo and Java off Asia; and New Guinea, Tasmania and Kangaroo Island off Australia. Another subtype is an island or bar formed by deposition of tiny rocks where water current loses some of its carrying capacity. An example is barrier islands, which are accumulations of sand deposited by sea currents on the continental shelf. Another example is islands in river deltas or in large rivers. While some are transitory and may disappear if the volume or speed of the current changes, others are stable and long-lived. Islets are very small islands. Majority of the Oceanic Islands are volcanic in origin. The few oceanic islands that are not volcanic are tectonic in origin and arise where plate movements have lifted up the deep ocean floor to above the surface. Examples of this include Saint Peter and Paul Rocks in the Atlantic Ocean and Macquarie Island in the Pacific. One type of volcanic oceanic island is found in a volcanic island arc. These islands arise from volcanoes where the subduction of one plate under another is occurring. Examples include the Mariana Islands, the Aleutian Islands and most of Tonga in the Pacific Ocean. Some of the Lesser Antilles and the South Sandwich Islands are the only Atlantic Ocean examples. The second statement is incorrect because we can not say that Continental Islands are affected by maximum plate tectonics, Oceanic Islands are affected by minimum plate tectonics."
