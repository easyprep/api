  "question": "Consider the following statements:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Jute is normally cultivated as an inter-crop between the two main agricultural seasons, Kharif and rabi</li>\r\n<li>Jute and Paddy are competing crops</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhich among the above statements is / are correct?",
  "option1": "Only 1",
  "option2": "Only 2",
  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 1",
  "explanation": "Jute is normally cultivated as an inter-crop between the two main agricultural seasons, kharif and rabi. Jute is an important cash crop, which is as an intercrop before paddy transplantation in most parts of the country. Paddy and jute are not competing crops as they are not sown during the same period on the same land. This has significant contribution to the farm income of a large section of rural households."
