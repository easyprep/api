The individual soul is not different from Brahman. Hence, its name Advaita meaning non-duality<br />• The basic theme of Advaita is that the one unchanging entity alone is real, while changing entities do not have absolute existence<br />The world is Maya or illusion and only the Self is real. A person who realises this attains moksha (liberation of the soul)"
