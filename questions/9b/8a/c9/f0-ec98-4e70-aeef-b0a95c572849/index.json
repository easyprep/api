  "option1": "India",

  "option5": "",
  "answer": "India",
  "explanation": "Indian Government is working on developing a \"soft power matrix\" to foster better diplomatic traction with neighbouring countries and rest of the world. Soft power is country's ability to persuade other countries to do what it wants without resorting to force or coercion. Country's unique culture, its political values and its foreign policies are the three resources that builds a country's 'Soft Power'. Currently, India's Soft Power is articulated in foreign countries through the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). ICCR works to promote India's artistic and cultural traditions through a range of activities such as organising 'Festivals of India' abroad. Besides, Indian Government's outreach efforts such as the propagation of Gandhian values and philosophy, extending educational scholarships to foreign students, showcasing the strength of the Mumbai film industry, extending humanitarian assistance to foreign countries affected by natural disasters and evenmementos offered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Heads of Government during his foreign visits are perceived as attempts to inform the world about Indian artistic and cultural heritage.",
