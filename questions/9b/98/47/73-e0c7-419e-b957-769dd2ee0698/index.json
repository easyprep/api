  "question": "Why a little pack of Silica Gel (granular beads of Silica made from Sodium Silicate) is packaged with many new items to control humidity and avoid spoilage or degradation?",
  "option1": "Silica gel molecules are hydrophilic with large surface area and so its molecules trap the moisture",
  "option2": "Silica gel is a Hygroscopic substance with large surface area so its molecules absorb the moisture.",
  "option3": "Silica gel molecules are with a portion that is charge-polarized and capable of hydrogen bonding, thus bonds with the water molecules",
  "option4": "The semi permeable pouch in which silica gel is placed absorbs the moisture which later reacts with water.",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Silica gel is a Hygroscopic substance with large surface area so its molecules absorb the moisture.",
  "explanation": "The silica gel molecules have a large surface area because of the pores of around 2.4 nm. So, it absorbs the moisture. Hydrophilic products are polarized and Hydrophobic molecules which generally don&#8217;t catch water are NON polar."
