  "answer": "Pakistan",
  "explanation": "The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) has decided to observe its retaliatory action on February 27 against the Indian air strikes on the Balakot terror camp as \\'Operation Swift Retort\\'. The tensions between India and Pakistan had escalated after the 14th February 2019 attack by a Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) suicide bomber in Pulwama that killed 40 CRPF soldiers. 13 days later, the Indian Air Force (IAF) carried out a counter-terror operation, hitting what it said was a JeM training camp in Balakot, deep inside Pakistan on February 26. The next day, the PAF retaliated and downed a MiG-21 in aerial combat and captured IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was later released and handed over to the Indian side on March 1."
