Statement 3 is incorrect:- Being the celibate nature of deity, according to temple traditions only old women and young girls are allowed inside the temple and those who have attained the age of puberty and to a certain time of life are forbidden to approach as all sexual intercourse in that vicinity is believed to be averse to deity ."
