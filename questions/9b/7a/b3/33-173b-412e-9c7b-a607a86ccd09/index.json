  "answer": "Only 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because the scheme is an initiative under the Ministry of Social Justice &amp; Empowerment. <u>Second statement is correct</u>. “Dr. Ambedkar Scheme for Social Integration” aims to promote Inter-Caste Marriages and the social upliftment of Dalits. Under the scheme, any individual who marries a Dalit partner will be given Rs 2.5 lakh upon getting married. This scheme was first started in 2013, but was hitherto available only to couples who had an annual income of Rs 5 lakh or lower. Recently, the government has done away with the financial ceilings and the scheme is now available for all."
