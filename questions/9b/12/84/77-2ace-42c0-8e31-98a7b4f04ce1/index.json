  "question": "A number, when divided by 119, leaves a remainder of 19. If it is divided by 17, it will leave a remainder of :",
  "option1": 2,
  "option2": 7,
  "option3": 10,
  "option4": 19,
  "option5": "",
  "answer": 2,
  "explanation": "On dividing the given number by 119, let k be the quotient and 19 as remainder.\r\nThen, number = 119k + 19\r\n$latex = 17\\\\times 7k+17\\\\times 1+2$\r\n$latex = 17\\\\left ( 7k+1 \\\\right )+2$\r\nHence, the given number when divided by 17, gives (7k + 1) as quotient and 2 as remainder. Hence option [A] is right answer."
