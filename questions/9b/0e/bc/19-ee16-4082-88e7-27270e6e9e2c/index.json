  "question": "How does a semiconductor behave at absolute zero temperature?",
  "option1": "like an insulator",
  "option2": "like a conductor",
  "option3": "depends on the material",
  "option4": "None of the above",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "like an insulator",
  "explanation": "At or close to absolute zero a semiconductor behaves like an insulator. When an electron gains enough energy to participate in conduction (is \"free\"), it is at a high energy state. When the electron is bound, and thus cannot participate in conduction, the electron is at a low energy state."
