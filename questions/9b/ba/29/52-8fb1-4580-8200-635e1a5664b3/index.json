  "explanation": "Georgia's national observatory is \"GENAO\". Georgian National Astrophysical Observatory (GENAO) was founded in 1932 by Academician Eugene Kharadze on Mount Kanobili, in Samtskhe-Javakheti, the southeastern part of Georgia. The altitude of Mt. Kanobili varies between 1650â€“1700 metres above sea level. The observatory is located approximately 250 km from Tbilisi, capital of Georgia; being distant from the air pollution and sky illumination together with excellent natural conditions (hilly landscape covered with coniferous forest) makes this place is among the best observatories at the same altitude range. Weather is stable, no harsh and sudden changes. The Observatory is running wide-profile research, spanning different fields of Astronomy, Astrophysics and investigation of the upper layers of the Earth's atmosphere."
