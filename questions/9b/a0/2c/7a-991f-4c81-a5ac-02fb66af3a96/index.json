  "option3": "Both 1 & 2",
  "option4": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Neither 1 nor 2",
  "explanation": "<u>First statement is incorrect</u> because writ jurisdiction of a High Court is wider than that of Supreme Court. Supreme Court can issue writs only in case of violation of fundamental rights, whereas High Courts can issue writs even in case of violation of legal rights. <u>Second statement is incorrect</u> because Supreme Court cannot refuse to exercise its writ jurisdiction, while a high court can do so."
