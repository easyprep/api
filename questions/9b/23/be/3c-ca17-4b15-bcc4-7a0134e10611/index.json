  "explanation": "Hungary formally ended World War I between most of the Allies of World War I through the \"Treaty of Trianon\". The Treaty of Trianon was prepared at the Paris Peace Conference and was signed in the Grand Trianon Palace in Versailles on 4 June 1920. It formally ended World War I between most of the Allies of World War I and the Kingdom of Hungary. French diplomats played the major role in designing the treaty, with a mind to establishing French-led coalition of the newly formed nations. It regulated the status of the independent Hungarian state and defined its borders generally within the ceasefire lines established in Novemberâ€“December 1918 and left Hungary as a landlocked state.",
