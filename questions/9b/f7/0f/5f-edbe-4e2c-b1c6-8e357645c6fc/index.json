  "question": "With reference to the upcoming DART mission in 2021, consider the following statements:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>The DART spacecraft will target the Didymos A asteroid.</li>\n<li>It is a part of the AIDA/ Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission.</li>\n</ol>\nWhich of the above statements is/are true?",
  "option1": "Only 1 is correct",
  "option2": "Only 2 is correct",
  "option3": "Neither 1 nor 2 is correct",
  "option4": "Both 1 and 2 are correct",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Only 2 is correct",
  "explanation": "<strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong>\nThe DART/ Double Asteroid Redirection Test is to be launched in 2021 by NASA. It will target the Didymos B, which is a part of the Didymos Binary Asteroid System. The binary nature will enable the scientist to study the effect of a ‘kinetic impactor’. The Didymos B is smaller than the Didymos A.\n <strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong>\nThe DART is a part of AIDA mission. AIDA was launched in 2015 jointly by NASA and the ESA (European Space Agency). The mission was to study the effect of crashing a spacecraft into an asteroid moon. This is to study its utility in deflecting an asteroid if it enters a collision course with earth."
