  "question": "Aurorae are produced by the collision of charged particles from Earth’s magnetosphere which arise due to __?<br />",
  "option1": "Solar winds",
  "option2": "Ozone layer",
  "option3": "Radio waves",
  "option4": "Ionosphere",
  "option5": "",
  "answer": "Solar winds",
  "explanation": "Aurora was also known as polar lights (northern lights or aurora borealis and southern lights or aurora australis).It is a natural display of lights in the sky in Arctic and Antarctic regions.  It is caused when streams of charged particles from Sun collide with particles from gases like oxygen and nitrogen present in the atmosphere of the Earth.\r\nThus, the solar winds disturb the Earth’s magnetosphere leading the charged particles in both solar wind and magnetospheric plasma, primarily electrons and protons to precipitate in the upper atmosphere. It is the resulting excitation and ionization of atmospheric constituents that light of varying colour and complexity is emitted."
