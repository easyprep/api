With this, 92-year old Mahathir became the oldest living Prime Minister of Malaysia and the world's oldest head of government. His coalition party 'Pakatan Harapan' defeated the governing Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which has been in power for more than 60 years. The victory capped a dramatic political comeback for Mahathir, who previously ruled the country for 22 years (from 1981 to 2003), and came out of retirement to take on Prime Minister Najib Razak after the leader became embroiled in a massive corruption scandal.",
