  "explanation": "Germany's government was also known as the \"Weimar Republic\". The Weimar Republic, officially the German Reich (Deutsches Reich), was the German state from 1918 to 1933. As a term, it is an unofficial historical designation that derives its name from the city of Weimar, where its constituent assembly first took place. The official name of the republic remained the German Reich as it had been during the German Empire because of the German tradition of substates."
